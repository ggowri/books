  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it turned out she had cancer, what would happen to her daughter and her in-laws? The thought filled Josie with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. With me here, a small lump like this is nothing to fret about. Now, take off your top," Marcus said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. Did she really have to undress again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, recalling her prior experience with Marcus, she felt slightly more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His treatments had indeed been effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Josie removed her silk blouse, revealing her flawless skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but notice the elegant lace bra she wore. The deep violet fabric struggled to contain her ample breasts as if they might burst at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her delicate neckline and the smooth, flawless contours made it hard for him to keep his thoughts in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing discreetly, Marcus marveled at how, despite Josie's slender figure, her full bust was anything but modest&mdash;rivaling that of a runway model.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll need to remove the bra as well," Marcus said calmly. "Otherwise, the treatment won't work effectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he intended to take advantage of Josie, but transmitting Numinous Energy through clothing would interfere with its effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was professional, but Josie's cheeks flushed deeply. Hesitating for a moment, she finally bit her lip and reached behind her back to unclasp the lace bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bra slipped off, her perfectly rounded, firm breasts were revealed, softly quivering in the cool air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her areolas bore a rosy hue, untouched and delicate as if time had paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Marcus's gaze, Josie wanted to disappear into the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other than her late husband, no man had ever seen her like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vulnerability made her heart race, but she reminded herself it was all for the sake of her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, I'm going to start now. Please bear with it," Marcus said, channeling his Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed a firm, steady hand on her right breast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warm energy surged through her skin, penetrating deeply into her tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie felt a sudden heat building in her chest, followed by a tingling sensation that sent waves of indescribable comfort radiating through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was oddly similar to the relief she'd felt when Marcus treated her earlier condition, yet this time, the sensations were even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both feelings were wonderful, and the same thing was that they were both addictive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes squeezed shut as she bit her lip hard, suppressing the sounds that threatened to escape her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the overwhelming sensations made it impossible to hold back entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soft, involuntary moans spilled from her lips as the dull ache within her breast faded away under the soothing effects of the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as her body adjusted to the stimulation, a new sensation swept through her&mdash;a deep, unfulfilled yearning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed her thighs together tightly, unable to resist the growing tension within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friction offered a fleeting sense of relief, but it wasn't enough to quench the overwhelming need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the pent-up pressure peaked, and a high-pitched gasp escaped her lips as her body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind went completely blank, and for a moment, she wished time would freeze, allowing her to savor the feeling forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her husband's passing, Josie had never experienced anything like this. In her loneliness, she had buried herself in work, exhausting herself to avoid dwelling on the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the wave of release had washed over her, liberating both her body and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman... Are you alright?" Marcus asked, pulling his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie finally came back to her senses and realized that she had lost control. She blushed and replied in panic, "I'm fine...Mr. Fitzgerald, is the treatment complete?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. The breast treatment was completed, but the dysmenorrhea had not been completely cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus began to treat Josie's dysmenorrhea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the experience from last time, this treatment went extremely smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was not as embarrassed as the first time, and even took off her pants on her own initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, only half of it was taken off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this sense of partial concealment only served to stir a man's desire even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Josie in such a state of ecstasy, Marcus couldn't help but feel an irresistible urge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't want to take advantage of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since Josie was still thinking of her late husband, Marcus knew he couldn't make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The treatment for dysmenorrhea lasted for half an hour, and under the strong stimulation, Josie reached the climax again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's body was shaking, and her private part kept contracting. She felt so comfortable that she almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was more sensitive than he'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, does your stomach feel better now?" Marcus withdrew his energy and asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's face was filled with a blissful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Marcus' question, she forced her eyes open, her voice soft with pleasure. "It feels so good. I feel like I'm floating on clouds... I never want to come down..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you feel better. With this treatment, you should be able to say goodbye to the pain for good," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying goodbye to pain was, of course, a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet for some reason, Josie felt a slight sense of loss deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the pain was gone, it meant she would never have the chance for Marcus to treat her again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Shelman... you should put your clothes back on. It's a bit chilly in here; you don't want to catch a cold," Marcus gently reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie suddenly realized that she was still bare-chested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned bright red, and she quickly pulled on her clothes. After adjusting her makeup, she regained her usual composed elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When do you plan to return to Solomia, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Josie asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow," Marcus replied, his voice calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie guessed that Marcus had probably stayed in Kingston specifically to help treat her, and she felt a wave of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... will we have a chance to meet again in the future?" Josie asked carefully, as if afraid of hearing a negative response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. After all, if the production line needs to be fine-tuned, I'll still need your expertise," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's mood shifted, her heart sinking a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words had brought their relationship back to a professional level, not one of friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, the doorbell rang.</span></p><div class="pagination">
