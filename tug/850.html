  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson's face turned awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You just downed a whole glass of such high-proof liquor. Not everyone can handle that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already had a few drinks. If he finished another glass, he'd likely get drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered, "But you said everyone drinks the same amount at the table. Since I've finished my glass, you should do the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the two-thirds of the drink still in his glass, he found it hard to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the young man sitting at the head of the table spoke up, "Bryson, he's right. He's our guest. If he's in the mood to drink, you should match him. Don't let us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed increasingly intrigued by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryson had no choice but to nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched his nose and downed the drink in one go. His face turned bright red instantly, and his stomach churned violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't forced himself to hold it in, he might have thrown up right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good job, Bryson!" Many in the room clapped for Bryson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the young man stubbed out his cigarette, sat up straight, and focused his gaze on Marcus. "You're Marcus, right? You seem to have quite the tolerance for alcohol. How about I join you for a few drinks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A waiter immediately entered and asked respectfully, "Mr. Watson, what can I do for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring us 10 bottles of whisky!" the young man ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whisky at Fortune Palace was a special edition, priced at 18,888 dollars per bottle. Ten bottles would cost nearly 190,000 dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been any other guest, the waiter would have definitely questioned and confirmed the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't need to do that this time. He simply left the room to fetch the drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple: the young man was Nolan Watson, the only son of the Watson family from Kingston, a family deeply intertwined with both politics and business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Watson family was a powerful clan with significant figures in the political arena and a vast business empire, including several large corporations worth tens of billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was the sole heir to the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of their political-business background, the Watson family didn't participate in the Uswad family rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with their overall strength, they would have been on par with, if not superior to, the so-called four great families in Uswad, and even the Brown family that Marcus had taken down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there were rumors that Nolan had a unique physique and had been trained in Ancient Martial Art by a master since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already achieved a considerable level of expertise and was considered a true expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter would have brought a thousand bottles without hesitation if Nolan had asked for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned by the scene. It seemed Nolan was about to take matters into his own hands and teach Marcus a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew Nolan was not only of noble status but also had an incredible tolerance for alcohol, known as the young man in Kingston who could drink a thousand cups without getting drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reputation was well-deserved. It was said that once, Nolan had a drinking contest with a foreigner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drank craft beer non-stop for a whole day and night. The foreigner ended up in the ICU, while Nolan drank a thousand cups without any ill effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, Nolan's name as the "thousand-cup man" had spread throughout Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Nolan ordered the waiter to bring more drinks, everyone knew a showdown was about to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having grown up in Kingston, Melina was well aware of Nolan's incredible drinking capacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Marcus worriedly and whispered, "Marcus, Nolan is known for his ability to drink a thousand cups without getting drunk. He really did it once. You shouldn't drink with him. If you get drunk, these guys will definitely humiliate you. I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself in front of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina had called Marcus over to help her leave, not to engage in a drinking contest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood Melina's intentions. He said, "These guys are clearly targeting you. Even if I don't drink, they'll find a way to get you to drink. I have to teach them a lesson today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was touched but still very worried. "Marcus, I know you're trying to protect me, but Nolan really has a huge tolerance for alcohol. I'm afraid you'll get drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Melina a reassuring look and turned to Nolan. "How do you want to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was surprised for a moment and then laughed, "One for me, one for you. We'll split these 10 bottles of whisky. Let's just rinse our mouths with five bottles each. We'll see how we feel afterward. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan spoke with an air of nonchalance as if it were no big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assumed Marcus was from out of town and hadn't heard about his drinking exploits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Marcus wouldn't dare challenge him so brazenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His agreement was exactly what Nolan had been hoping for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan had been thinking of a way to get this country bumpkin drunk and humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would love to get Melina into bed and toy with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Marcus to walk right into the trap. Since Marcus took the bait, Nolan wasn't about to let the opportunity slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the onlookers gasped at Nolan's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some thought, "Five bottles of whisky just to rinse the mouth... That's an incredible tolerance. No wonder Mr. Watson didn't join us in drinking earlier. He was just toasting Melina. It turns out Mr. Watson didn't bother drinking with us because our tolerance wasn't even worth his time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all eyes were on Marcus. They wanted to see if he'd accept Nolan's challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he did, he'd likely end up in the hospital after downing five bottles, and Melina's fate would be predictable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy was pretty arrogant earlier. Let's see if he dares to take on Mr. Watson's challenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can handle five bottles of whisky. He's not stupid. I bet he won't dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. Even if he does, he'll lose to Mr. Watson and end up in the hospital. Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many whispered among themselves, their gazes on Marcus turning more intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, Nolan sneered arrogantly, "So, are you up for it? If not, leave the room now and leave Melina here to drink with us. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many laughed, understanding Nolan's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Marcus accepted the challenge or not, Nolan was determined to get Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Nolan finished speaking, Marcus replied, "Did I say I wasn't up for it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
