  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson casually reached out and grabbed Edward's wrist, locking it in his grip. Edward struggled with all his might, but there was no escaping. With a slight twist of his arms, Gibson snapped Edward's arm with a sickening crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward let out a blood-curdling scream, his eyes wide with terror. "Ah!" He then thought in disbelief, "I could go toe-to-toe with Gibson just now. How did he get this strong all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the crowd at the VIP seating area was frozen in shock. Edward's arm was broken, and the outcome of the fight was clear. There was no need to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin hurriedly tried to call off the match, but Gibson ignored him entirely. Like a demon possessed, he proceeded to break Edward's other arm and both legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators felt their hearts tighten in fear. Edward was a former </span><span>Uswad</span><span> combat champion, yet he couldn't even put up a fight. To see him reduced to this state, his limbs shattered, was utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson stood in the arena, exuding arrogance. "This is boring. So damn boring. You </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighters are just too weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the crowd booed him relentlessly, he remained unfazed, full of contempt. He went as far as flipping off the audience, showing no remorse for his brutality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mayor Benjamin, I told you before that your </span><span>Uswad</span><span> champion wouldn't last three moves against Gibson, but you wouldn't listen. A great nation like </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, and yet you can't produce a single decent fighter? It's laughable." Pete smirked at Benjamin, his face brimming with pride. Gibson publicly crippling Edward had completely satisfied Pete's competitive ego.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face turned utterly grim as he said, "This is supposed to be a competition, not a death match. Your fighter's actions are completely out of line. He's violated the rules, and I'll be filing a formal protest with your government." As he spoke, guilt </span><span>gnawed at him. Marcus had warned him earlier, and now he regretted not listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glanced at Marcus, her expression shifting as she thought, "Did he really guess right? Could Gibson actually be a cyborg?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete, unfazed by Benjamin's threat, smirked and replied mockingly, "Don't be mad, Mayor Benjamin. Blame yourselves for being too weak. If </span><span>Uswad</span><span> had a decent fighter, this wouldn't have happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa chimed in, "Mr. Hudson is absolutely right. </span><span>Uswad</span><span> can also find someone stronger than Gibson to engage in a no rules fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who defeats Gibson in the ring would avenge our </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighter. But then again, with the inferior genetics of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> people, it seems nearly impossible to find someone capable of matching Eldoria's fighters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alyssa seemed to completely forget she was an </span><span>Uswad</span><span> citizen herself. Her words fawned over the foreign nation while tearing down her own, perfectly embodying the disgraceful image of a traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take him on," Maxine declared, unable to stand it any longer. She rose from her seat, her righteous anger burning bright. She had always been the type to despise injustice and arrogance, and the smug attitudes of the Weston Land people pushed her over the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete sized her up with a sneer. "Oh, the little cop is mad? You're cute, I'll give you that. But let me give you some advice&mdash;don't play with fire unless you're ready to get burned. You're no match for Gibson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned bright red as she clenched her teeth in anger, seething at his arrogance. The audience, infuriated by Pete's smug behavior, was boiling with indignation. Many wished for a </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighter to step forward right then and there to give Gibson a well-deserved beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus stood up beside Maxine. His voice was calm as he addressed her. "Sit down. Don't act impulsively." Maxine shot him a questioning look, unsure of his intentions. Still, she nodded and reluctantly sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his gaze to Pete and asked, "So, what you're saying is that as long as someone from </span><span>Uswad</span><span> steps up, Gibson will accept the challenge, correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete gave a careless nod. "That's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, "And by 'no-rules fight,' you mean life or death doesn't matter. Ask Gibson if he dares to take on such a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete adjusted his tie, finally catching on to what Marcus was implying. With a smirk, he replied, "I don't need to ask him. I'll decide for him. We'll fight by those rules. Don't tell me you're the one planning to step into the ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled faintly, "Any problem with that?" Hearing this, Pete burst into uncontrollable laughter, nearly doubling over. He laughed so hard it seemed like he might fall over, his mockery echoing across the arena.</span></p><div class="pagination">
