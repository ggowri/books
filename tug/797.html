  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet slammed into the Maybach's window with a sharp crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular Maybach, supplied by local authorities, wasn't bulletproof&mdash;just standard issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glass shattered instantly, and the bullet came dangerously close to hitting Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened as the gravity of the situation sunk in&mdash;someone had actually tried to assassinate him, in broad daylight, no less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard stood frozen for a </span><span>moment,</span><span> his usual confidence replaced with a look of alarm as it dawned on him that Marcus' warning wasn't just paranoia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't waste a second. He reached into his Spatial Ring and pulled out a standard firearm, moving with a calm precision that belied the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three rapid shots rang out, echoing through the street like a drumbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets found their marks, each one delivering a fatal headshot to the gunmen hidden in the buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of the assailants, stationed close to the windows, toppled lifelessly through the shattered glass and hit the pavement with a sickening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps rippled through the bystanders on the street, their shock palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who in their right mind would attempt to assassinate a national leader? The sheer audacity of it was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly left them speechless was the young man sitting in the passenger seat of Julian's car. His shooting wasn't just skilled&mdash;it bordered on superhuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was moving at full speed, and the targets were more than </span><span>550</span><span> </span><span>yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, without pausing to aim, Marcus had fired three consecutive shots, each one hitting its mark with a headshot. That was deadly accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the best marksmen in the world couldn't pull off something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard, a man who once prided himself on his sharpshooting, could only stare in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always considered himself among the best, but watching Marcus in action shattered that illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Commander, someone just made an attempt on your life. We should turn back immediately and retreat to a secure location. This inspection needs to end here," the driver urged, his tone firm but laced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This driver wasn't just anyone&mdash;he had been with Julian for years and was one of his </span><span>most trusted confidants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried weight, and Julian wasn't one to dismiss them lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's weathered eyes flickered toward Marcus for a brief moment before he made his decision. "No. We're not turning back. Keep driving. I want to see who has the nerve to try and kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian wasn't just a leader&mdash;he was a seasoned war veteran. His courage and determination had been forged in the fire of battle, and this was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Part of him was driven by a desire to face the danger head-on, but another part wanted to test whether Marcus' warnings held water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver hesitated, clearly uneasy, but before he could argue, Julian's voice cut through like steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do as I say. That's an order." His tone left no room for debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver clenched the wheel tightly, nodding reluctantly. Worry clouded his expression, but he followed Julian's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus was right, charging into a situation like this, with assassins reportedly waiting ahead, was a gamble that could cost them dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Julian, a flicker of respect crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian wasn't the man Marcus had expected&mdash;he was far more resolute, far braver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car sped past the intersection and approached the nursery, where more gunmen lay in wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't stand a chance. Marcus didn't even let them pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blur of motion, he fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shots were even faster this time, his precision sharper, his movements effortless.</span></p><div class="pagination">
