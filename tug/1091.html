  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana gestured towards the adjacent drawer and said, "There are medicines. Would you grab them for me, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus opened the drawer and saw that, alongside typical household remedies, there were numerous medications for gastrointestinal issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Morgana had been grappling with stomach problems for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you develop these stomach problems? Why do you have so many medications for gastrointestinal diseases?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana explained, "I developed them during my university days. After starting working at Solomia Institute of Technology, I often pulled overtime and skipped meals. Sometimes, I was so swamped that I completely forgot to eat. Over time, this led to my stomach problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I'm really into spicy food. So, my stomach problems flare up occasionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each time, I suffer for days before feeling better. Well, I just can't resist spicy food. I really have to cut it out in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then urged, "Give me the medicine. I'll feel better after taking it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana reached out her hand to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus eyed the medications and furrowed his brow. "These aren't for curing your stomach problem at all. Most of them are just painkillers. You might not feel the pain for a bit after taking them, but in the long run, they'll do serious damage to your stomach. Have you thought about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana replied helplessly, "What else can I do? When the pain hits, I just need to make it stop, even if it's just for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus squinted, looking at the girl writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blurted out, "What if I could completely cure your stomach problems? Would you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana's eyes widened in astonishment. "Don't tell me you're a doctor, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "I know more than just regular medicine. Ordinary treatments won't fully fix your stomach. It'll keep flaring up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, what kind of treatment do you know?" Morgana continued, her face brimming with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find out once I cure you. But right now, I need to ask for your permission. Do you want me to help?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, please treat me. If you can get rid of my stomach problems, I'll be indebted to you however you want," Morgana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few years, her stomach problems had been a constant torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone could actually cure her, it would be like a new beginning, and that wasn't an overstatement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who'd experienced chronic stomach issues knew the true significance of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just brace yourself. There might be some unexpected sensations during the treatment," Marcus warned Morgana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Timeless Numinous Energy had an aphrodisiac effect, and he had to make this clear to her in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana didn't grasp his implication, thinking the treatment might just be a bit painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything else I should know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Morgana's dress and said, "You'll need to remove the top part of your clothes to make the treatment easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Morgana's cheeks flushed bright red. She shot him a glare. "Are you really treating me, or do you have other motives?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes and stated, "Of course, I'm treating you. What other motives could I have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't blame Morgana. Asking her to undress right away was bound to raise suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, initially reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, stripping in front of a stranger made Morgana extremely embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her slight affection for Marcus, she was still hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the relentless pain in her stomach caused her to wince again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt wretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she said, "You have to promise you're only treating me and not trying anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately nodded and declared, "I promise I'm just treating you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Marcus' earnest expression, Morgana bit her lip and slowly began unbuttoning the top of her dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to her large bust, the moment she undid the buttons, the top of her dress sprang open.</span></p><div class="pagination">
