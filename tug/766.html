  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for lifting the curse from me. Please accept my deepest gratitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael bowed deeply to </span><span>Marcus,</span><span> his face filled with overwhelming </span><span>gratitude</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, Marcus' kindness was nothing short of a rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his feelings of gratitude were beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the other members saw that their chief's cultivation had improved after the curse was lifted, they became even more excited, their hearts filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus helped Susan's father, Elliott, the deputy chief of the Nuer Tribe, lift the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's strength was slightly weaker than Raphael's, but after lifting the Cursed Power, his internal restraints were also removed, and his cultivation broke through to the peak of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a major leap in strength for him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was also deeply grateful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Marcus proceeded to help the middle- and high-level members of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him the whole day to remove the Cursed Power from 50 high-level members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each  of</span><span> them experienced significant improvements in their cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It led to a qualitative transformation in the overall strength of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After helping more than 50 people remove the Cursed Power, Marcus' Numinous Energy </span><span>was</span><span> severely depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his complexion appeared poor, and he looked extremely fatigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but say to the Nuer Tribe, "I need three hours to recover my energy. Once I've restored it to full capacity, I will continue helping you all remove the Cursed Power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, one of the members turned to Nadia and Susan, saying, "You two should go inside with Mr. Fitzgerald and attend to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both girls exchanged a glance and nodded, ready to accompany Marcus into the room to assist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus waved his hand and said, "I'm only recovering my energy. There's no need for you to serve me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan were a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had gradually come to take pride in serving Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he had said so, they could only comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Marcus entered the room alone and began cultivating </span><span>the </span><span>Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, using Timeless Numinous Energy to restore his depleted vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three hours, his energy had fully recovered, and he had returned to peak condition again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped out of the room, the Nuer Tribe members immediately surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they knew he would eventually help everyone lift the Cursed Power, they still hoped that they would be the next ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus' gaze fell on Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes immediately brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Susan, come with me to the room," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having previously used his X-ray vision to observe her condition, Marcus had noticed that although Susan's curse was not as severe as Nadia's, the long-term curse had caused significant damage to her internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had not yet fully manifested, so on the surface, Susan appeared quite healthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And under the Cursed Power's influence, Susan's potential had been completely suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his observations, Susan's potential was no less than that of Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the curse was lifted, her latent potential would be fully unleashed, and her cultivation level would also improve by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's beautiful eyes flickered as she gently nodded at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she followed him into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, Susan's heart couldn't help but beat faster, and her face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because Nadia had previously told her about the process of Marcus removing the Cursed Power from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Susan was curious about the wonderful sensations described by Nadia, just hearing her friend's account made her blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel a strange, impulsive feeling stir within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the room, Susan asked, "Mr. Fitzgerald, how can I cooperate with you to remove the Cursed Power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said casually, "Lie on the bed and lift the clothes on your lower abdomen so that I can perform my skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing that, Susan's heart began to beat even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was exactly like the process Nadia had described to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't help but wonder what the cloud-like sensation Nadia had spoken of actually felt like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan lay on the bed with a flushed face and showed her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin was flawless and looked very smooth and delicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus entered the Nuer tribe, he saw Susan naked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he was still impressed by her devilish figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The process of lifting the Cursed Power will take about half an hour. Afterward, I will help you restore the organs damaged by the Cursed Power and remove the restrictions it placed on your internal potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During the process, you may experience some unbearable sensations. Just try to endure it as best as you can," said Marcus before casting the spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan nodded </span><span>lightly,</span><span> her heart was pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Marcus asked as he noticed her flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's nothing. It might just be because the room is a bit warm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan quickly came up with an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it warm in here? Also, your heartbeat seems to be accelerating. Relax, it won't hurt," Marcus reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan took a deep breath and gently closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was ready, Marcus began to perform </span><span>the </span><span>Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of Timeless Numinous Energy surged in his palm, and his large hand slowly pressed against Susan's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the first stream of the energy entered her body, Susan felt as if she had been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled sharply, and an involuntary, enticing sound escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face became even more flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this be the feeling of being on a cloud that Nadia was talking about? It really is quite strange," Susan thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she had experienced just now had been both stimulating and refreshing. She felt the mysterious area in her lower abdomen contract, and a vague sense of pleasure began to spread to various parts of her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Susan seemed to have underestimated the intensity of the stimulation that Timeless Warrior's Grimoire could have on women's sensitive nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the release of the technique by Marcus intensified, a more powerful and ferocious Numinous Energy poured into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Susan let out a high-pitched cry, and an even stronger pleasure swept through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her face even more flushed and all the sensitive nerves in her body were awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious gap between her legs was slightly moist, causing her delicate body to move constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs were also clamped together at that moment as if trying to touch the convex points in the mysterious gap to obtain a more intense pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan couldn't help but let out an alluring moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Marcus' good-looking face, and there was a hint of affection in her gaze.</span></p><div class="pagination">
