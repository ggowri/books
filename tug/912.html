Now, you can go ahead and announce your decision to pass the leadership to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett's body trembled at Joel's words. He glanced down at Cecilia, instantly understanding what Joel was trying to do. He knew that if he refused, Joel wouldn't hesitate to kill her. On top of that, Joel had already planted a miniature bomb on him. At this point, neither of them had any way out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the cold look in Rhett's eyes, Joel pressed him impatiently. "Come on, Dad, don't keep everyone waiting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, every eye in the banquet hall was locked on the two of them. Several media outlets had already set up their cameras, eager to capture this historic moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rhett's gaze swept over Joel with indifference before he finally spoke, "I, Rhett McHale, hereby declare that I am willingly passing the position of head of the McHale family to Joel McHale. From this day forward, everything belonging to the McHale family will be under his control."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment those words fell, everyone present realized&mdash;the McHale family, which controlled one-third of the global medical industry, had officially changed hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of Joel's most loyal followers immediately started clapping. Then, more and more people joined in, and soon, thunderous applause filled the hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lowering his voice, Rhett reminded Joel, "I've given you the family leadership, Joel. I trust you'll keep your promise."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only reason Rhett had compromised was for Cecilia's safety. He and Joel had made a deal&mdash;if he willingly handed over the family, Joel would guarantee that she would be left unharmed. But deep down, Rhett feared Joel might go back on his word, which was why he wasted no time in reminding him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel gave him a small nod and said, "Don't worry. I always keep my word." But as he spoke, a flash of coldness flickered through his eyes, gone as quickly as it appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he turned toward Cecilia, his tone carrying a feigned sense of calm. "Cecilia, are you willing to relinquish the family leadership to me? If you are, go ahead and sign this agreement."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Joel finished speaking, someone immediately stepped forward and handed her a document. Once she signed it, she would have no further ties to the McHale family's leadership.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the McHale family was already in Joel's hands. The only reason he was putting on this performance was to silence any critics, making it seem as though both Rhett and Cecilia had willingly stepped aside for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia took the agreement, her face darkening. She knew that if she refused to sign, Joel would definitely go after her grandfather.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to put her name on the document, a voice rang out from the crowd. "You mustn't sign it, Ms. McHale! Once you do, Joel will come for both you and Sir McHale too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person speaking was none other than </span><span>Ogder</span><span> Hargrove, the same man who had accompanied Cecilia to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> earlier. He had been her father's right-hand man, and </span><span>even after her parents passed away, he had remained by her side, continuing to serve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ogder</span><span> had always been fiercely loyal, determined to help her take her rightful place as head of the family. But Joel? He was trying to seize that position by force. Worse still, </span><span>Ogder</span><span> had overheard a conversation between Joel and his men about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The plan was clear&mdash;once Rhett and Cecilia publicly acknowledged Joel as the head of the family, Joel would get rid of them both at the first opportunity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
