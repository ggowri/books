  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, this isn't something we should be worrying about," Gina said, her voice light with mock concern. "But seriously, how does a guy who needs a credit card to buy a house land Catherine a </span><span>ten-</span><span>million-dollar job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, really," she added, shaking her head. "Do you think that's even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile was tight, her words laced with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said it partly because she couldn't imagine Catherine ever getting close to someone like that, and partly because she didn't want her to fall for some scam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Rodney, Gina, that's not a credit card," Catherine interjected firmly. "It's a Supreme Card, reserved for clients with deposits over 100 billion dollars. Marcus owns multiple businesses, and 30 million dollars is pocket change to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's tone was steady, but her frustration was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina blinked, then burst into a disbelieving laugh. "Catherine, come on. First, you claim he got you a ten-million-dollar job. Now he's sitting on hundreds of billions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you hear yourself? People like that don't hang out with families like ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words </span><span>stung,</span><span> her jealousy poorly disguised as skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family was so wealthy, yet her boyfriend was just a government employee, earning only a few hundred thousand a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Catherine mentioned that Marcus had 100 billion in savings, Gina couldn't help but feel a bit envious and, at the same time, became even more skeptical of what Catherine was saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, let it go," Rodney said, his tone laced with exasperation. "This guy's clearly a fraud. A billionaire? Please. Don't waste your tongue on him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Catherine, his voice taking on a fatherly scold. "Catherine, stop dreaming. You're setting yourself up for disappointment. People with that much money don't waste their time with small fry like us. The world doesn't work like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stick to your league, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina nodded in agreement, feeling vindicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least her boyfriend wasn't some over-the-top fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine felt her temper flare. She couldn't understand why her uncle and cousin refused to believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could defend herself further, Rodney suddenly gasped, clutching his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Dad, are you okay?" Gina's voice was frantic as she rushed to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney's face was pale, his voice barely a whisper. "My heart... call Dr. Nell... hurry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg Nell was Rodney's trusted cardiologist and a close family friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, he'd managed Rodney's heart condition, and now his expertise was urgently needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina fumbled with her phone, quickly dialing Berg and explaining the situation in panicked bursts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Berg promised to arrive immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the hospital was less than a mile away, and Berg would be here soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's expression softened with concern. Despite everything, Rodney was still her uncle, and she didn't want anything to happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, can you help him?" she asked suddenly, her voice quiet but full of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine remembered how Marcus had saved her mother from late-stage cancer, a feat no other doctor had dared to attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone could help Rodney now, it was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, his demeanor calm and focused as he knelt beside Rodney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his X-ray vision, he quickly assessed the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was clear: Rodney's aorta was completely blocked. Without immediate intervention, he wouldn't survive the next five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus leaned in to begin treatment, Gina stepped forward, her eyes flashing with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing?" she demanded, her voice sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina's eyes turned cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, Marcus knows medicine," Catherine explained, her tone urgent but calm. "He can help Uncle Rodney. Please, trust him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina's jaw tightened, her expression growing colder. "Catherine, are </span><span>you</span><span> serious right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a heart condition. Do you know how many doctors have tried to fix this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now you're telling me this random guy is some kind of miracle worker? Is he even a doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine stood her ground. "He's not a doctor, but his skills surpass most professionals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina's patience snapped. "Not a doctor? Then what the hell is he doing touching my dad? Are you trying to get him killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His aorta is completely blocked. If it's not cleared in the next five minutes, his heart will stop. You decide&mdash;do you want me to save him or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice cut through the tension, calm and measured.</span></p><div class="pagination">
