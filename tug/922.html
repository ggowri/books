  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved a hand at </span><span>Ogder</span><span> and said, "No need to thank me. As long as you stay loyal to Ms. McHale, that's enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ogder</span><span> immediately nodded vigorously. "I will follow your guidance, Mr. Fitzgerald, without question!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cecilia stepped </span><span>forward,</span><span> gratitude written all over her face as she addressed Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, if it weren't for you today, the McHale family would have collapsed by now. I have no idea how to ever repay such a huge favor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had already saved Cecilia's life before, and now he had helped her resolve a major family crisis. To her, it felt like he had given her a second chance at life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved a hand dismissively, saying, "I told you before&mdash;helping you settle this family crisis might seem like a big deal to you, but to me, it was nothing more than a small favor. So don't dwell on it too much. Just consider it a welcome gift for coming to </span><span>Uswad</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Cecilia was at a loss for words. As she looked at Marcus, her deep blue eyes shimmered with admiration and gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the crisis within the McHale family was completely resolved. Seizing the opportunity, Cecilia launched a full-scale internal investigation, rooting out those who had harmed the family's interests and eliminating the remnants of Joel's faction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had officially secured her position as the head of the McHale family. From this moment on, no one could challenge her authority. It was exactly the outcome Rhett had hoped for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing that Marcus disliked being in the spotlight, Cecilia wasted no time in locking down all information. She ordered the deletion of every photo and video recorded at the scene, along with any articles or posts that had made their way online.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, the only way the events of that night in the McHale family's banquet hall could be passed on was through word of mouth. No one outside truly knew what had gone down behind those closed doors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the news of Joel, Tobias, and Luna's capture spread through </span><span>Acoton</span><span> like wildfire. It sent shockwaves through </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> medical industry, leaving many of Joel's former business partners completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Cecilia took her power back, she didn't just purge Joel's remaining allies within the family&mdash;she also went after his business associates, cutting them off completely. The fallout was immediate. Their businesses took a nosedive, and many even went bankrupt overnight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wasn't about being ruthless. She knew that the only reason Joel had been bold enough to challenge her for control of the family was because of the network of shady deals and backers he had built. Without their support, he would never have dared to make his move. In a way, his downfall was as much their doing as his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of this had much to do with Marcus. So once everything settled, Cecilia personally led him on a tour of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, showing him around the production facilities and corporate headquarters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the tour, Marcus had to admit&mdash;he'd seen a lot. McHale Pharmaceuticals Group truly lived up to its reputation as one of the top three pharmaceutical giants in the world. It wasn't just about their cutting-edge technology or strict management. The company's philosophy and deep-rooted legacy were on a whole different level, something an ordinary business could never compare to. Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture, his own company, still had a long way to go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he wasn't discouraged. This visit had been an eye-opener, and he'd gained valuable insights into McHale Pharmaceuticals Group's approach. Once he got back home, he planned to pass on what he had learned to Michelle and Yvonne. They needed to refine Golden Group's management structure if they wanted the company to grow stronger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
