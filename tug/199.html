  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm not talking nonsense. In fact, it is thanks to Mr. Roger Gellar's support behind the scenes that my career has been so smooth over the years and that my status in the Burnett family has been getting higher and higher. However, I couldn't tell you before," Malcolm explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. With Mr. Roger Gellar's support, there is no doubt that you will take the position of the head of the family!" Ruth smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that she yearned for power and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to achieve her goal herself, she transferred her enthusiasm to Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Burnett is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a voice came from outside the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes were on the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine appeared accompanied by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Burnett is back. Today's birthday party is becoming more and more interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. I learn that Shaun will propose to her at Sir Burnett's birthday party. Maxine is likely to marry into the Whitman family in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I heard about it, too. It is almost certain to come true because it involves a deal between Shaun and Mr. Malcolm Burnett..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh... Don't talk nonsense. If someone with ulterior motives hears us, it will get us into trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Maxine, many people were talking in low voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They focused on Maxine and automatically ignored Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, you're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen and Hazel came forward to greet her with smiles. Hazel noticed Marcus and asked, "Maxine, is this your new bodyguard? He's quite good-looking. I've told you before that when it comes to hiring bodyguards, it's not about looks but about ability. Why didn't you listen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine has been like this since childhood. Mom, please don't blame her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella walked over, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a doctoral student who had lived abroad for many years and received higher education, she exuded fashion and elegance and had a scholarly air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these traits were so well balanced in her that everything came so naturally.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hazel and Stella actually regarded Marcus as Maxine's bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Stella, Marcus is not my bodyguard but my friend. He was forced to come here with me by Tyler!" Maxine explained. When she mentioned Tyler, her eyes were sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Tyler force you? How dare he!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine reminded Hazel, "I didn't lie. Uncle Malcolm sent Tyler to coerce the two of us. I have a premonition that something serious is going to happen today. Mom, you and Dad should be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel frowned, thought for a while, and said, "Malcolm is just eyeing your father's position as the head of the family. Your father has told me that if Malcolm wants, he can give it to him at any time. Your father has been too tired for so many years. It's time for him to take a rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Stella has found a boyfriend abroad, a native of </span><span>Acoton</span><span> with a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and I are worried about you. We hope you can find a good husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, if Shaun comes to propose marriage, you must agree to it. Marrying into the Whitman family aligns with the interests of the Burnett family, and your father and I don't have to worry about your future. Being Shaun's wife is no worse than the future heir of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, during this period, your father, Stella, and I don't want you to come into contact with other men so as to avoid being gossiped about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel involuntarily glanced at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't make it clear, her intention was self-evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella crossed her arms over her chest and said, "Exactly. Maxine, I think what Mom said makes sense. You must marry into the Whitman family in the future. Even if we allow you to date other men at will, not everyone can enter the Burnett Villa. Do you think so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Stella, let me reiterate. I don't want to get married at all. Even if I have to, I won't marry someone like Shaun. So, even if he comes to propose today, I won't </span><span>agree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In addition, Marcus is my best friend. We once fought side by side. He saved my life. Of course, he is qualified to enter the Burnett Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
