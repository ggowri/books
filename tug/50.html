  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's words immediately garnered the approval of others at the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Robert, his impression of the man dropping even further. "Whether I can make Yvonne happy has nothing to do with you, Mr. Cooper. Besides, my affairs don't need outsiders meddling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what makes you so sure the son of farmers can't accomplish anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were firm and resonant, leaving no room for doubt about his stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had initially intended to stay out of the confrontation but couldn't stand the ugly arrogance of Robert and his ilk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp retort was logical and well-founded, even earning a fresh look of appreciation from Yvonne, who typically held him in low regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert chuckled, clearly surprised by the audacity of the "country bumpkin" before him. "So tell us, what have you accomplished? How much money do you have? What do you do for a living?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you. The young man beside me, Haley Brown, is the son of the chairman of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, the largest medical company in Solomia. His net worth exceeds ten billion dollars. As someone with experience, I can tell you that Mr. Brown is a much better match for Yvonne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Marcus's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>TreatMed Pharmaceuticals was a frequent business partner of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was a leader in Solomia's pharmaceutical industry, its scale didn't come close to the diversified operations of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the kitchen door swung open. A middle-aged man wearing an apron emerged, carrying a few steaming dishes. "Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Brown, Robert. It's been a while since I cooked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the voice, Marcus turned to look, and he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man before him was someone he had met just the day before. It was none other than Charles, Solomia's most renowned internal medicine professor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Yvonne is Charles Miller's daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but marvel at the sheer coincidence of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles, too, froze in place when he saw Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded slightly. "Mr. Miller, we meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles's gaze shifted between Marcus and Yvonne, his expression growing increasingly perplexed. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you and my daughter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could my father possibly know Marcus? And not only that, but he's speaking to him so respectfully. What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to make sense of it, Yvonne quickly explained, "Dad, Marcus is my boyfriend. You already know each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Yvonne braced herself for a scolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the expected fury never came. Instead, after confirming her words, Charles's expression morphed from surprise to excitement and finally to uncontainable joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Yvonne, is that true? Mr. Fitzgerald is really your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles's face radiated anticipation, making it clear how much he hoped for an affirmative answer, which left Yvonne and Emily utterly baffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles was famously particular about social class, always insisting Yvonne marry someone of equal standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne wondered, "What's gotten into him today? Did he hit his head?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus doesn't look like he has a penny to his name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvonne! Didn't you hear my question? Answer me already!" Seeing that Yvonne hadn't said anything for a long time, Charles started to get a little anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Charles, Marcus was a legend in the medical world, a once-in-a-century genius. In Charles's mind, Marcus had already surpassed the value of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been obsessed with medical research and had an innate reverence for those who were more skilled than him in the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's ability to turn the impossible into the miraculous still lingered in Charles's memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Yvonne could marry someone like Marcus, Charles felt it would be the greatest fortune imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Marcus is my boyfriend," Yvonne finally admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her confirmation, Charles couldn't help but burst into hearty laughter. "Yvonne, you've made your father proud! You've found yourself an excellent boyfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let's celebrate properly! Bring out the whiskey your grandfather left behind. It's a perfect occasion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles began rummaging through a cabinet, eventually producing two dusty bottles of vintage whiskey which were gifted as awards to notable contributors during the nation's founding era.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not only rare but of immense historical value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite countless important occasions in the past, Charles had never been willing to open them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this scene, Emily and Robert were utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert vividly recalled how he had once begged Charles for a taste of the whiskey, only to be firmly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charles, are you feeling alright?" Emily asked cautiously, unable to comprehend his behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could be wrong? I'm just happy!" Charles shot Emily a look before pouring Marcus a glass of the prized whiskey, his manner unusually respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charles said to Marcus, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I must apologize for not properly welcoming you to my home earlier. Please forgive me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
