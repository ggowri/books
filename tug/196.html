  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the four presidents left, Lester returned alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything else?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lester replied, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I want to remind you that Harvey has been seriously injured. The Burnett family in Kingston will definitely target you. You should leave here as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, although Marcus' identity was not simple, he was still not as influential as the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if there's nothing else, you can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at Lester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his worries, Lester could only walk out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had given </span><span>Marcus</span><span> advice, and it was up to him whether to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked it up and found that it was Maxine calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up, Officer Burnett?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me you were in Kingston? I'm downstairs at your hotel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's somewhat reproachful voice came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned. "Are you downstairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Don't you believe it?" Maxine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly approached the floor-to-ceiling window and saw Maxine waving at him downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried downstairs and found her attractive in light-colored sportswear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know I was here? Did you send someone to follow me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes and explained, "I'm not that boring! Mr. Wilde told me that you were in Kingston, so I did some research."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just met Logan, Brenden's son, yesterday, and Maxine learned the news and locked down his location so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised him very much. The power that she possessed was even stronger than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we had dinner a few days ago, you refused to return to Kingston, didn't you? Why are you back now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was somewhat helpless. "Today is my grandfather's 80th birthday. He has always been in poor health, and I'm afraid he won't survive many years... I have to come back anyway..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just get off the plane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Maxine in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my honor that after getting off the plane, you came to see me right and didn't go home," Marcus teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's pretty face turned red. "Don't be so narcissistic. I'm just passing by...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I heard from Mr. Wilde that you had a conflict with Harvey yesterday. Fearing that they would take action against you, I came here immediately to check on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows. "Doesn't this just show that you care about me a lot? You can even put your grandfather's birthday aside for the time being. It really proves the saying that a grown girl won't stay at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face turned even redder, and she glared at him fiercely. "Be serious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, "Nowadays, telling the truth will be criticized."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's blushing face made her a shy girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It formed a sharp contrast with her previous heroic and brave image, and it also showed feminine beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hurt my son. How dare you still stay in Kingston? I really admire your courage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an extremely icy voice came from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Maxine looked over and saw a group of people coming towards them. Each of them held a submachine gun, and they soon surrounded them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader was dressed in a suit and had gray hair with a powerful aura. It was Harvey's father, Donald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a member of a branch of the Burnett family in Kingston, his strength should not be underestimated after he worked in the family for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His network of contacts was extremely extensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that Marcus knew Brenden, Donald hired a group of killers from the underground world in order to avenge Harvey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the siege of many armed killers, Marcus remained calm and asked with a sneer, "Are you Harvey's father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you know this, why don't you surrender and wait for your death?" Donald said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harvey was his only son, and seeing him beaten badly by Marcus, Donald felt so distressed that he was determined to avenge Harvey even at the cost of his own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Donald finished speaking, Maxine growled, "Donald, how dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned for a moment. Then, he noticed Maxine next to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"M-Ms. Burnett, how could it be you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donald, it's my grandfather's 80th birthday. Shouldn't you be at home? Why are you here? Don't you even care about his birthday party?" Maxine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she released the dignity that a young lady from a wealthy family should have.</span></p><div class="pagination">
