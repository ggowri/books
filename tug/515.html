"From now on, teach your son not to flaunt the title of the Whitman family's future heir recklessly. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kent nodded repeatedly, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald's guidance will be etched in my heart. Thank you for giving my son a chance to correct his ways."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon was filled with confusion and hatred. He couldn't comprehend why his father feared this man so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, because of a single word from Marcus, his father had cut off one of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, Landon had thought that, as the future heir of the Whitman family, crushing someone like Marcus, a so-called country bumpkin, would be effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he found himself the victim of his own arrogance, suffering a fate of his own making.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Neil and Cloe's faces were dark with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, they had been arrogant, confident that Landon's support would ensure Cloe's position as family heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had openly disregarded family ties, challenging Davey and Melina for the inheritance in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, witnessing Landon lose a finger at his father's hand, their faith in their plans had crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, they had previously mocked Marcus, thinking he was unworthy to even be compared to Landon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that the backer they had been so proud of would amount to nothing more than an ant in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver was respectful in Marcus' presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they considered him to be country bumpkins from Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back, they felt a strong urge to slap themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, I always thought we were family. Whether you or I became the family head was the same to me. But today, I finally realized that only I thought that way. You've always been plotting to compete with me for the position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, to secure this position, you've even used the Whitman family as leverage to attack my boyfriend. Since that's how it is, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked at Cloe and said coldly, "As the family's heir, I hereby announce that from today onward, I am expelling Neil and Cloe from the Thurman family. All shares under their names are to be revoked, and they are never to return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Neil and Cloe's faces turned deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neil gritted his teeth and said, "Melina, you may be the heir, but you have no right to expel us from the Thurman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, Bowden, who had been lying in bed, spoke up, "From now on, Melina's words are my words. If Melina says you are to be expelled from the Thurman family, that is my command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Neil and Cloe's expressions completely fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were truly expelled from the Thurman family, it meant they would have nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only would they lose the chance to compete for the family head position, but even their shares would be revoked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a devastating blow, a tragic end to their selfishness and greed for power, to their disregard for family bonds, and to their unscrupulous means of trying to seize the position of family heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. Very well. Even you, Dad, are so biased toward Davey's family. Since that's the case, my daughter and I will withdraw from the Thurman family. From now on, we have no ties with you!" Neil's voice trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stormed out of the room with Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, </span><span>Battle God</span><span>, if there is nothing else, we'll take our leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Kent bowed to Marcus and Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus casually waved his hand, signaling them to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a face full of resentment, Landon left the Thurman Villa with Kent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no interest in them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlow and Shaun were already destroyed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Whitman family was a puppet of the Deleon family, a family on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus would never waste his time on such a useless family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I will take my leave as well," Oliver said, bowing to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Oliver also departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only Bowden and Davey's family remained in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davey and Kari exchanged glances and walked over to Marcus, bowing respectfully. "Mr. Fitzgerald, we were wrong to misunderstand you before. We hope you don't hold it against us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it was Sir Thurman's illness or the crisis facing the Thurman family, we are deeply grateful for your help. You are the savior of the Thurman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved dismissively. "It's nothing. I just hope you will trust your daughter more in the future and not listen to slander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Davey and Kari blushed with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Davey, who had slapped Melina after being manipulated by Neil's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thinking back on it, he felt deep guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, when will you marry Melina? I'm looking forward to having great-grandchildren!" Bowden laughed heartily.</span></p><div class="pagination">
