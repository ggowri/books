  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To </span><span>get</span><span> the amulet </span><span>back </span><span>as soon as possible, Marcus headed back to the Winchester Villa early the next morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived, Abigail was out. The bedroom was empty. Marcus rummaged through the nightstand and found the amulet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stuffed it into his pocket and was about to leave when the door creaked open. In walked Natalia, Abigail's younger sister.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was clad only in a lacy black nightgown, leaving a generous expanse of her peachy-soft skin exposed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted into a sneer when she spotted Marcus. "Look who's skulking around - the worthless freeloader himself. What the hell are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At nineteen, the college sophomore had just gone home yesterday.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since Marcus had caught Abigail cheating at a hotel, Natalia had no idea about the scuffle that had taken place between Marcus, her sister Abigail, and Felix.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just getting my things," Marcus muttered, trying to squeeze past her. But she blocked his way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything here belongs to my sister. You own nothing. Bet you're here to steal, you lowlife creep! Can't you be a bit grateful?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three years since he'd married into the family, Natalia had made it her mission to tear him down at every turn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Marcus was just dead weight dragging Abigail down. She couldn't wait to kick him out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you! I'm just getting my stuff. Move</span><span> aside</span><span>. Now." His voice turned deadly cold. "Or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though sharp-tongued, Natalia was a knockout, no doubt about it. She had her sister's sultry looks with an added dose of youth and innocence that made her even more attractive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few months, she had blossomed into a more mature version of herself, her skin flawless, and her curves accentuated in all the right places.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That see-through nightie she wore was extremely eye-catching, revealing her creamy skin and plunging cleavage that seemed to go on forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delicate fabric clung to her figure, hinting at the fullness of her breasts, which were perfectly rounded and inviting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hem of her ultra-short dress barely skimmed her thighs, showcasing her long, </span><span>perfect</span><span> legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could even catch a glimpse of her Hello Kitty-patterned underwear, with the edges peeking out just enough to reveal a hint of the enticing pubic hair lay beneath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, getting bold now?" she taunted, arching her back with defiance. "I'm not backing down, no matter what you do to me. Wanna force yourself on me? Go ahead and try!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I doubt you could handle a real woman anyway. You don't even count as a man!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes raked over him, deliberately provocative, as she crossed her arms under her chest in a way that pushed everything up and out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes turned cold as he watched Natalia's rebellious posture. "You asked for this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could take her insults, but questioning his manhood? That crossed a line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift move, he grabbed her and threw her onto the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her black lace nightie rode up, revealing her Hello Kitty patterned panties underneath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You useless bastard! Don't you dare mess with me! My sister won't let you off about this! Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just sneered, then he pulled off his belt and began lashing down on Natalia's backside with force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike painted her ass a deeper shade of red as she squirmed and screamed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed, "Not such a big mouth now, huh? You filthy tease! Thought I wasn't man enough? Let me show you how wrong you are!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The belt kept falling, showing no mercy. His other hand, however, couldn't resist caressing the other side of her glowing red buttocks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's screams grew louder, but they didn't sound like pain. If anything, they sounded like pleasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face told the whole story - pure ecstasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stop... harder... please... it feels so good..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, a mocking smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's the scene?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The high-and-mighty top student was actually a freak?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My, what a family of perverts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh yeah, Marcus... I need more. I love this so much! Please, I want you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harder Marcus struck, the more Natalia seemed to thrive. Her eyes locked onto his, dark with desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand slipped lower, brushing against her inner thighs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guess what? He found she was soaking through!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cute, girly panties were now drenched, a large damp patch spreading across the fabric.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little slut, strip yourself and get on your hands and knees. Now!" Marcus commanded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's face flushed red, and all her arrogance had vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She obeyed instantly, peeling everything off and arching her back like a cat in heat. The glistening folds between her legs stretched open, and the soft, pink labium was inviting, almost begging to be filled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't wait for another second. He positioned himself and thrust deep into her, drawing out a loud, piercing cry</span><span> from Natalia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pressure overwhelmed her, and her pussy clamped around his dick tightly, urging him to move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steady rhythm, Marcus drove into her, his hips pumping hard as they both lost themselves at the moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
