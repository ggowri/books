  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This allowed Marcus to advance to the peak of the Fifth Stage of Ancient Martial Arts, with only a single step separating him from the Sixth Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his power grew, his combat abilities underwent another transformation, with every aspect of his physical condition improving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he finished all this, Marcus checked the contents of the Spatial Rings he'd taken from Eden Child and his followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, there were not only hundreds of billions of dollars, but also many cursed items used by Curse Weavers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of these items were made from human bones, skin, and organs&mdash;crafted through dark, twisted methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While these artifacts could deliver powerful results in battle, Marcus burned them all to ash with his flames without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he was eager to grow stronger, he had no interest in using such evil tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Curse Weaver pills, however, were different. He decided to keep them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could tell they were made from herbs and contained no human elements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike the pills used by warriors or wizards, Curse Weaver pills often produced surprising results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus casually took one of the healing pills. His wounds healed at an incredible rate, and his blood seemed to boil with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he realized the pill was designed to trigger a burst of potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While useful in life-threatening situations, such pills could cause permanent harm to the body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had a dozen or so of these pills, likely very expensive in the Curse Weaver world, and Marcus planned to keep them for extreme situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, he found a Curse Weaver manual in Eden's ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The manual outlined the basics of Curse Weaving and detailed an evil faction known as the Bloodthirsty Cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This cult, located deep in the Southvaia rainforests, had existed for millennia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden held a significant position within the cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant that Marcus had unknowingly made an enemy of the Bloodthirsty Cult, and he would likely face powerful Curse Weavers in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While many of the dark items in the rings were useless to him, Marcus considered it a valuable haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that eliminating enemies and taking their treasures was still the quickest path to wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Marcus never killed unless absolutely necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After going through the loot, Marcus received a message from Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today's the day of the third meridian clearing. Mr. Fitzgerald, I'll be waiting for you in Room 2601 at the Hilton."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A playful emoji accompanied the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus suddenly remembered that it was indeed time to help Grace open her third channel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting dressed and having breakfast, Marcus headed straight for the Hilton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once her third channel was opened, Grace could officially begin training in Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young woman was eager to learn, and Marcus didn't want to disappoint her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, with her previous experiences in mind, Grace was visibly less nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus rang the doorbell, and Grace's sweet, innocent face appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was wrapped in a white bath towel, her wet hair hanging loosely, and the fresh, feminine scent of her body filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, she was just out of a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You just got out of the shower?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, I didn't want you to think I was...dirty," Grace replied, her cheeks flushing a soft pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just thinking about their last encounter made her heart race even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today... are we clearing the veins in the perineum area?" Grace asked, her voice tinged with nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She understood what the perineum area implied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, just make sure you're mentally prepared," Marcus nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In front of you, I'm just another patient. There's no gender divide between doctor and patient, right? Yeah... that sounds about right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace mumbled to herself, trying to steady her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she slowly began to undo her bath towel, revealing that pale, pinkish, youthful figure full of a girlish charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention Grace's pure and youthful face, but just her body alone made it clear that she was a very young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every inch of her skin was as soft as a baby's, with a smooth, delicate texture, and a flawless pinkish hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was worlds apart from the more mature women around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet she retained the fullness typical of a mature woman, especially her breasts, which were exceptionally firm and perky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed much more obedient today, even lying down on the bed on her own and slowly spreading her legs open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dark forest emerged, and through the gaps in the dense woods, a faint pinkish hue could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is this okay?" she asked shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, she would never have imagined that one day she would face a man with such a shameful posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just spread them more so I can get better access," Marcus suggested gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the pinkish gap in the dense forest, Marcus felt a surge of heat in his lower abdomen, burning the desire to fill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he suppressed it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
