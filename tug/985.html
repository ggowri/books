  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had just met. And on top of that, she was Ada's cousin. He had completely ignored these basic facts and said such indecent words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infuriated Silvia to the point where she almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of pure disgust, she glared at Marcus and gritted her teeth, "From the way my cousin described you, I couldn't even begin to imagine that someone could be as shameless as you. Now, it seems like I seriously underestimated your level of shamelessness! I can't fathom how you have the gall to say such things to a woman like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't care at all about Silvia's sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, beautiful women, or women who could help him advance in cultivation, were almost like clothes&mdash;meaningless if there were no emotional attachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Silvia had come to him of her own accord. She kept talking about killing him, and to Marcus, anyone who openly threatened him was considered an enemy. He never showed mercy to his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, dominating her forcibly was also a form of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Marcus responded with a smile, "A beautiful woman is meant for a man. You're so gorgeous, isn't it perfectly normal for me to be attracted to you? Not to mention, you came right to me yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Silvia's anger erupted completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "You shameless scoundrel! I can't believe you're such a despicable man! If I don't kill you today, I will never be able to rid myself of this hatred! Take this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Silvia gathered all of her power, unleashing an overwhelming aura that filled the air with suffocating pressure. A blue energy swirled around her, and to Marcus's surprise, it formed into a pale blue bird-like totem that floated around her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Silvia launched a Hand Strike and the blue totem unleashed a terrifying destructive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ear-piercing bird screech rang through the air as the totem and her Hand Strike hit Marcus, attempting to engulf him completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Silvia had said earlier, this time, she was using far more power than her previous attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus estimated that this blow was almost the full strength of an Ancient Martial Stage Nine peak expert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant this woman had some real skills&mdash;at least enough to challenge someone above her rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even if Silvia's power was considerable, the difference between their cultivation levels was too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with her attack, Marcus casually threw out a punch, still using only 10% of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two energies collided with a thunderous explosion. The destructive force rippled out in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's body was violently pushed back once again. Though her posture was better than before, it was still evident that she was at a disadvantage in this clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me this is all the power you have?" Marcus said with a cold smile. "If that's the case, you're no match for me. Just take off your clothes and get in position. I'll insert myself into you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To deal with a woman like Silvia, Marcus knew the only way to subdue her completely was through force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, I swear I'll kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's chest heaved with anger, and her breathing quickened. Her body trembled with intense fury. Her face was filled with disgust and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had completely crossed the line now. His earlier comment about wanting her for the night had already touched her bottom line, but now, he was even more despicable, explicitly talking about "inserting".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an utter humiliation to Silvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She charged forward again, unleashing her attack toward Marcus with renewed fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes instantly became sharp as knives. No matter how flashy Silvia's attacks were, he completely disregarded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful motion, his large hand shot out as he ignored her attacks entirely. In a flash, he grabbed her by the throat!</span></p><div class="pagination">
