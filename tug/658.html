  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit the crowd like a thunderclap, leaving everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence followed as disbelief spread across the faces of the crowd. Every single person stood frozen, unable to process what had just been said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always been the target of ridicule and dismissal from his classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, just a few short years after graduation, the once-ignored kid had somehow become someone powerful enough to decide the fate of the chairman of Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone in the room, it felt like a deep-water bomb had exploded beneath their feet, shaking them to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson and Vivian were utterly dumbfounded. They had never in a million years imagined that Marcus had such a prestigious status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie shared their disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first encounter with Marcus since high school had been at the custom jewelry store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she thought he couldn't even afford Tears of the Angel and had snickered at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She treated Joan like her top-tier customer, while ignoring Marcus completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a moment of frustration, Marcus had dropped 650 million to buy every piece of jewelry in the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Natalie still thought that amount was probably the limit of Marcus' wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this reunion was completely upending her understanding of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson had always prided himself on being the most successful in the class, constantly mocking Marcus and Chad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Natalie had believed that in front of Jenson, Marcus didn't even stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she realized that in front of Marcus, Jenson wasn't even worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few words, Marcus had effortlessly stripped away the one thing Jenson had built his fortune on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, he'd promoted Chad, who had been barely scraping by as a food delivery driver, into the role of General Manager of Sync Group's East Sales Division.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure like that was standing before them, and yet they hadn't even realized it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make things worse, most of them had been standing by Jenson's side, mocking and belittling Marcus all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, looking back, Natalie felt an overwhelming urge to vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted looking down on Marcus so much that she wished she could crawl into a hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If, back when he bought the jewelry, she had treated him with sincerity, their relationship would have turned out completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Marcus had pursued her all through school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had rejected him back then, when they'd run into each other again just a few days ago, Natalie had been confident that she could win his heart back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it felt like it was too late for any of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie felt like she'd lost the most precious thing in the world, overcome with a desire to bang her head against the wall in regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad was also frozen in shock. Grinning awkwardly, he said to Marcus, "Man, I had no idea you were this powerful! I'm seriously in awe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even know how to praise Marcus properly, so he just gave him a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Chad a playful slap on the shoulder and asked, "Do you think you can manage Sync Group's sales division?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad hesitated, looking uneasy. "Marcus, you know I know nothing about sales. Managing such a big company? Honestly, I'm not confident at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze shifted to Silas, and he calmly ordered, "Contact the headquarters immediately. Get them to send a few of their best salespeople and managers from Solomia to assist Chad with the work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silas immediately nodded. "Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Silas stepped out of the room to make the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of realization swept over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no longer a matter of qualifications or experience. It was about power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter whether Chad was actually qualified for the role. Marcus had made up his mind, and that was that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the rest of them, it felt like a punch to the gut. The idea that someone like Chad, who had once been struggling to get by as a delivery driver, could now be in charge of such a massive company was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, a few of them started to regret not trying harder to connect with Marcus when they had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they'd known who he would become, they could've been in his circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might have been able to change their futures with just a single word from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, looking back, they realized that if they'd only backed Marcus at the dinner instead of siding with Jenson, things might have turned out so differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The opportunities had been there, right in front of them, and they hadn't taken them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, still have any doubts?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad shook his head, still trying to wrap his mind around it all. "Nope, none. But... I've got to ask. What's the salary looking like for this gig?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
