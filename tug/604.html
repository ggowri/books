  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, they heard Diana's voice from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly pulled on his clothes and shouted to Diana, "Just a moment. I'm just tidying up some tools in the supply closet. I'll be right out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane couldn't help but laugh. "What a lame excuse, honey. Who's going to believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glared at her. "You little tease, you're still laughing? If you hadn't been so tempting, I wouldn't have needed to make up an excuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane giggled. "I am a tease, but you're no better. I just teased you a little, and you couldn't resist, could you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly cleaned up and left the supply closet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had already set the table and sat with Pearl, waiting for Marcus and Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, was tidying up the tools in the supply closet that tiring? Why are both of your faces so red?" Diana asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane almost burst out laughing but managed to hold it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a bit stuffy in there. We should install an air conditioner tomorrow." Marcus made up an excuse and started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Diana's gaze sharpened slightly. "Mr. Fitzgerald, it seems like there are warriors looking for you. You should go and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus extended his spiritual senses and immediately sensed two powerful auras rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them had reached at least Ancient Martial Stage Six. Although they were no match for Marcus, they were still considered top-tier in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys go ahead and eat. I'll go take care of this," Marcus said, putting down his cutlery and heading towards the edge of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived at a desolate mountain area where two figures were standing. One was a man, and the other was a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked over sixty, dressed in a green frock that gave him an air of otherworldly wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was an ethereal beauty. Her white gown added to her otherworldly appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you from the Celestial Arc Order?" From their auras, Marcus could tell who they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, Ada Wakefield, said, "You're sharp. Since you know we're from the Celestial Arc Order, why don't you submit to us?" Her tone was haughty as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "You expect me to submit as soon as you open your mouth? Don't you find that a bit presumptuous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man, Colby, was enraged by Marcus' insolence. He barked, "How dare you speak to the Saintess of the Celestial Arc Order like that! Submit yourself and apologize to Her Highness immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Colby spoke, he unleashed a powerful burst of coercion. It was meant to force Marcus to bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus stood his ground, unaffected by the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colby was shocked. As the Grand Elder of the Celestial Arc Order, he was at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six, just a step away from Stage Seven. He was confident that even a casual display of his power would be enough to subdue Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not only was Marcus unharmed, he had completely ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colby was furious. He lunged at Marcus, but Ada stopped him. She said to Marcus. "You've killed members of the Celestial Arc Order before. Mr. Spacey has ordered your death. But I see potential in you. If you submit to the Celestial Arc Order, we will spare your life and give you a high position, even making you an Elder. This is your only chance. I hope you'll consider it carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange expression crossed Marcus' face at her words. He looked at Ada and said, "I can't figure out what gives you the confidence to say something like that to me. To be honest, I wouldn't even want to be the leader of your Celestial Arc Order, let alone deal with a mere elder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada frowned. "I can't believe how arrogant you are! If that's how you feel, you'll have to face the wrath of the Celestial Arc Order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Wakefield, don't waste your breath on him. Watch as I destroy this insolent lad!" Colby could no longer contain himself. He stepped forward, unleashing a powerful aura as he raised his hand, sending a powerful palm strike aimed at Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
