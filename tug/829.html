His connections were far beyond what they could imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Kristen to know Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Silver Horn Order was one of the most powerful gangs in Kingston's underground world, and recently it had joined forces with the rapidly growing Axe Gang, boosting its status even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed if Eamon really brought the Silver Horn Order's men, then Marcus and Natalia would have to pay a terrible price for their actions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the commotion had drawn the attention of other salespeople in the shop, who started gathering around to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Ronan was involved in the conflict, many of them cast pitying looks at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that Ronan was arrogant and domineering, a person who couldn't be messed with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family not only had money but also connections in both the legal and illegal worlds, with a lot of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all felt Marcus must have used some underhanded scheme to get the Wilder family's accounts frozen, and the Wilder family would stop at nothing to make sure Marcus paid the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a convoy of business cars arrived at the Lamborghini 4S shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of people from Kingston's underground world got out, all carrying weapons and looking fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men at the forefront, middle-aged with an imposing presence, were none other than Kristen and Eamon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two lackeys hurried to open the door of the 4S shop for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his father arrive, along with people from the Silver Horn Order, Ronan's face immediately lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried over and said, "Father, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen nodded at Ronan and then said, "Don't just stand there, go greet Mr. McCallany!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon was older than Kristen, and his status was much higher. Ronan knew he had to show respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen had paid a hefty price to get Eamon personally involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had given Eamon an ancient national treasure, worth over a hundred million dollars, just to seek justice for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan quickly bowed to Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon waved his hand and asked, "Who did this to you? I'll deal with them right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Eamon was over fifty, he still exuded the ruthless aura of an underground world figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mere words sent a chilling, bone-deep cold through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara and the other salespeople were all shaken by the powerful aura emanating from Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara thought to herself, "Now this is the real underground world boss. Just a few words from him are enough to make people shiver in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy in front of me actually dared to use underhanded tactics to frame the Wilder family. Now he's going to pay the price for his actions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ronan pointed at Marcus and said, "It's this guy. I don't know what trick he used, but he reported my father to Ms. Shelman, and she immediately froze all our family's accounts. Mr. McCallany, you must help us tear this guy to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's gaze shifted to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Silver Horn Order had only recently joined the Axe Gang, Eamon didn't recognize Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus was only in his twenties, Eamon's expression turned mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You look so ordinary. I never expected you'd know Josie. But I bet you never imagined that Kristen knows me. If you had known, you probably wouldn't have dared to pull tricks behind our backs, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
