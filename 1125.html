  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it even possible to manipulate such an immense amount of star power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been in the dark about Isa's true strength; she had never been straightforward with him. Whenever she spoke of her abilities, it was clear she was </span><span>pulling his leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, she once claimed to be merely Class AAA, yet she had suddenly soared to the top of the Godson Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Isa was much more than just Class AAA&mdash;she wasn't even merely a Class S! At the very least, she was a deity. As for her exact standing among the divine, Osborne had no clue. However, judging by the respect shown to her by the God of Stars and the fact that the God of Time, Ophelia, had not gained the upper hand in confronting her, it was evident that Isa was far from ordinary, even among gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing that the God of Time was just beginning to recover and wasn't at her peak Deity King strength, the fact that Isa could make Ophelia back down was a testament to her remarkable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But witnessing her effortlessly control such an enormous volume of star power still left Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think that, at his current level, he could barely manipulate a fraction of what Isa was wielding&mdash;maybe one ten-thousandth, if he was lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she can control this scale of star power, just imagine the destructive force she could unleash! It would likely surpass the power of most atomic bombs, even hydrogen bombs! She could wipe out an entire city!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on him. Yet, despite his worries, he couldn't help but feel proud. Isa was his partner, and the stronger she became, the happier he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only downside was that it made it even harder for him to take charge in their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely! A Divine Body is made up of Divine Bone and Divine Flesh! The Divine Bone is fundamental and serves as the backbone of the Divine Body. If the Divine Bone isn't strong enough, the Divine Flesh won't hold up either, and the whole Divine Body could collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thus, the Divine Bone must be forged through relentless trials!" Isa explained calmly as the terrifying star power swirled around her, compressing and condensing violently, almost as if it were being hammered into shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a complete Divine Bone materialized before Osborne and the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sense of awe, but it was the God of Star who was truly electrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this was his Divine Bone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a radiant glow erupted from the Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a faint red light, yet it shone brilliantly, transforming the bone into something that resembled lustrous stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful aura filled the air, and Osborne could feel it wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was practically bouncing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Bone Radiance! This is Divine Bone Radiance! A Level One Divine Bone Radiance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, taken aback, quickly asked, "God of Star, what exactly is Divine Bone Radiance? What does it do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, the God of Star explained, "As Ms. Night mentioned, Divine </span><span>Bones come in different strengths. The better the refinement, the more translucent and radiant the Divine Bone becomes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But truly powerful Divine Bones will emit a divine light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Bone Radiance is classified into seven levels, though some say there are nine, distinguished by color! The red glow represents Level One Divine Bone Radiance, followed by orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate Level One Divine Bone Radiance! It's reserved for super talents! I was once just an ordinary minor god, and my Divine Bone was nothing special. Even after ten millennia of refining, it never produced Divine Bone Radiance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, Ms. Night has reshaped my Divine Bone, and it's erupted with Level One Divine Bone Radiance! How can I not be thrilled? With a Divine Bone like this, not only will I fully regain my strength, but I'll also rise to new heights!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was practically vibrating with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when the excitement seemed to peak, something even more astonishing happened. The red brilliance radiating from his Divine Bone began to shift and transform, gradually taking on a soft orange hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Two Divine Bone Radiance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was initially stunned, but his shock was premature. In mere moments, the orange glow transitioned to a vivid yellow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Three Divine Bone Radiance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hardly contain himself, his spirit quivering with exhilaration in the form of his Divine Soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isa finally paused her efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Three Divine Bone Radiance is the best I can do for you right now! But that should be more than enough; after all, even most gods, or those in higher tiers, typically settle for Level Three Divine Bone Radiance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa spoke, the God of Star erupted with joy, exclaiming, "Thank you, Ms. Night! Your generosity in recreating my Divine Bone means more to me than words can express. I would gladly give my all to repay you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled softly, "Hold your horses! There's still the Divine Flesh to reforge. Fortunately, that's a bit simpler than the Divine Bone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she resumed her work, and soon enough, a complete, radiant nude body stood before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body shimmered, glowing with a resplendent yellow light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his cheeks redden as he awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Star... is a goddess?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
