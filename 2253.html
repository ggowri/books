  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne confirmed his victory, he intended to leave and return to his quarters to continue his training. However, he was asked to stay for the awards ceremony and the send-off event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no choice but to comply, he remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him was watching with avid eyes, their looks brimming with admiration, practically worshiping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attention made Osborne feel a bit awkward, but he steeled himself to push down the discomfort and waited for the ceremonies to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a familiar figure showed up beside him, and the lovely fragrance in the air told him it was Angela, the Peak Lord of Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said, flashing a warm smile, "Osborne, you were amazing! I'm so proud of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been at the Mystic Sirius Sect for over thirty years, and this is my third time overseeing the Sect Tournament. In the previous two tournaments, not a single </span><span>disciple from Peak Seven managed to make it into the top twenty, let alone get a better ranking. It was really mortifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, you've brought glory to our peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're the champion, and a well-deserved one at that! Before the tournament, no one had high hopes for you, but you shut everyone up. Great job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Angela gave Osborne a friendly nudge on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "You're overpraising me, Ms. Olsen. I just did my best. And this is just the Sect Tournament. There's still the city duel in Tempest Fortress City and even the state duel in Zephyr State ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The opponents I'll face there will be a whole different ballgame. That's where the real challenge lies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face lit up at his words. "You're so down-to-earth and humble! Winning the Sect Tournament is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan are strong within the Mystic Sirius Sect, but they're not big shots in Tempest Fortress City. Don't get too cocky. I hope you can at least make it to the top three in the city duel! Aiming for the championship might be a long shot, but with hard work, anything's possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, after I steamrolled my way to the Sect Tournament championship, your bar for me in the city duel is just a top-three finish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think winning the city duel will be an uphill battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are there really that many heavy-hitters out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression turned solemn. "Yes, there are some real powerhouses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect hasn't had a disciple in the top three of the city </span><span>duel</span><span> for a century! The top positions have been locked down by Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The previous top three from the last city duel will be back in the fray this time. On top of that, I've heard that both Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle have new prodigies&mdash;dark horses with mind-boggling strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you made mincemeat of Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan, cracking the top three in the city duel will be no walk in the park. As for snagging the championship..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela left her sentence hanging, but it was obvious she had doubts about Osborne's odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lifted an eyebrow, his curiosity sparked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll dig up some info on your opponents and get it to you pronto so you can gear up. I won't pile on the pressure; you've already knocked it out of the park. My baseline expectation for you in the upcoming city duel is to land a top-five spot. After that, just roll with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving his shoulder a comforting pat, Angela continued, "Now, go soak up the awards ceremony! This is your time to shine! And make sure you prep properly. If you hit a snag in your training, don't hold back from coming to me. I might not be the top-tier warrior, but I can definitely help you sort things out. Just don't let your mind play tricks on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Angela wrapped up, she took off, and an Elder escorted Osborne to the awards stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this Sect Tournament, Osborne had emerged as the ultimate dark horse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd taken down last year's champ, Vadim, the runner-up, Jamar, and the third-place finisher, Bethan, to claim the undisputed championship title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan, with her nifty footwork and skills on display, managed to outshine Jamar in their match and snagged the runner-up spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar, despite giving it his all, had to settle for third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top ten contestants stepped onto the stage one by one, they all practically buzzed with excitement. For a lot of them, just making it into the top ten was a dream come true. After all, it meant racking up Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and getting a ticket to the upcoming city duel in Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was Osborne's turn, Lenny stepped in to present the award himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning from ear to ear, Lenny walked up to Osborne and handed him a shiny golden medal of honor. It was emblazoned with the Mystic Sirius Sect's emblem and a big, bold number&mdash;One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny declared, "This proves you're the mightiest disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, congrats!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've tapped into Sacred Power before your peers, and I can't wait to see you fly the flag for Mystic Sirius Sect in the city and state duels. I'm banking on big things from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lenny draped the badge on Osborne, he felt a subtle energy thrumming from it, leaving him lost for words for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact?!" Osborne blurted </span><span>out,</span><span> his eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bingo!" Lenny shot back with a beaming smile. "This here's a quasi-Sacred Artifact, and it's a defensive one at that. It's called the Badge of Mystic Sirius! You're a real gem for Mystic Sirius Sect, and this'll keep you out of harm's way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your hard-earned prize! Just bear in mind, you'll have to take it off during the city duel </span><span>'cause</span><span> defense divine artifacts are a no-go in the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a wave of elation washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quasi-Sacred Artifact, particularly a defensive one, was an absolute gem. He never would've dreamed that the Mystic Sirius Sect would be so lavish. As the champion, he'd not only bagged a hundred Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> but also this amazing artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the in-house competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder, if he could really shine in the upcoming city duel, state duel, or even the zone duel, would there be a Sacred Artifact waiting for him as the grand prize?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought had his excitement levels skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the send-off ceremony. The top ten finishers from the Sect Tournament were going to represent the Mystic Sirius Sect in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City, which was scheduled for two weeks later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Bethan, Jamar, and the rest were each given a special battle robe. These robes were a real head-turner, emblazoned with the Mystic Sirius Sect's emblem and </span><span>sporting a huge wolf's head on the chest, exuding an aura that was nothing short of intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny gave everyone a pep talk, voicing his hopes that they'd ace the upcoming city duel. Then, the send-off ceremony wrapped up to the rousing cheers of the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne was free to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of heading straight back to his room, he made a beeline for the betting table to collect his loot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the top-twenty competition kicked off, Osborne had put down a hundred Sacred Crystals on himself to win the championship, with odds of a hundred to one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that measly hundred had ballooned into a whopping ten thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he cashed in his bet, he noticed the bookie's face was a picture of misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne had come out of nowhere like a dark horse and cleaned up in the competition. The bookies had been salivating at the thought of making a fortune, but instead, they were left high and dry, all thanks to Osborne's gutsy bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the perfect example of "easy come, easy go," and they felt like they'd just wasted their time for nothing!</span></p><div class="pagination">
