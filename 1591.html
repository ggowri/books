  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Wild Flame Army sent over 50 thousand troops to support Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were two vice generals, five leaders of ten thousand, fifty </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>, and five hundred centurions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them was at least a Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining squad leaders and regular members also met that same standard&mdash;no one below Transcendent Deity was included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dawn broke, a resounding horn echoed through the air. Osborne's wrist terminal buzzed with a summons from the Wild Flame Army, demanding his immediate presence for assembly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every chosen soldier to aid Divine Peak Nine received the same urgent call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the summons would have dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!" Osborne wasted no time and stepped out of his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guy's command was tasked with selecting a thousand individuals to head to Divine Peak Nine, and the list had been finalized in discussions between Guy and Osborne, who had already integrated these troops under his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne arrived, the troops were already prepared, their eyes gleaming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Keep it together, everyone. Don't let anyone outside catch on to our connection. Wait for my orders for everything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, my Lord!" they replied in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, their expressions shifted from eagerness and admiration to something colder&mdash;defiance, even anger and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's more like it!" Osborne said, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his official title was merely that of a Human Community leader. Even though he had risen to the rank of chiliarch and was now their direct superior, it was only natural for them to harbor some resentment or contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their current demeanor was the expected norm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least no one would suspect that these thousand men were fervent Blood Clan descendants, utterly devoted to Osborne and willing to lay down their lives for him at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Murray's ranks, another thousand were also ready to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that out of the 50 thousand troops from the Wild Flame Army heading to support Divine Peak Nine, two thousand would follow Osborne's commands without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In critical moments, they might prove invaluable," Osborne mused to himself before gesturing for the assembly to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! To the gathering point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The designated location was just outside Wild Flame City, on a vast open field where five massive Malevolence Airships were docked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these vessels stretched over a hundred yards long and could accommodate around 10 thousand troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top-grade Malevolence Airships!" Osborne exclaimed as he spotted the impressive ships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were about to board these high-speed vessels, which were capable of reaching speeds of 180 thousand miles per hour, to head to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Wild Flame Army, centurions were allotted low-grade Malevolence Airships, </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span> received mid-grade ones, while leaders of ten thousand and brigadiers were granted top-grade Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the commanding generals had access to the Ultimate Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, "Vice generals and army commanders, on the other hand, are Deity King warriors. They're incredibly fast; even the Supreme Malevolence Airships can't compare to them. Their strength allows them to traverse the entire </span><span>Celestara</span><span> without needing an airship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne recalled that he had three Malevolence Airships in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a mid-grade Malevolence Airship he received upon his promotion to chiliarch, measuring about 30 yards long and capable of carrying roughly a thousand people at a speed of 120 thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, he possessed an Ultimate Malevolence Airship and a Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially impressive was the Supreme Malevolence Airship, a marvel of engineering that was both formidable and versatile. Its immense defensive capabilities could withstand multiple attacks from Deity King warriors, making it a critical asset. With two main cannons and ten secondary ones, even the most powerful Deity Overlords had to tread carefully when facing its full-firepower barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Supreme Malevolence Airship had the ability to execute basic interdimensional travel, allowing it to navigate the complexities of the battlefield with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its cruising speed exceeded 600 thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this airship represented more than just military might; it was one of his lifelines in the perilous challenges awaiting him at Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, obtaining such a vessel was no easy feat. Only the Paramount Supreme Clan could procure a Supreme Malevolence Airship, and not even the ten major Upper Races could lay claim to one without colossal achievements on their part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's own Supreme Malevolence Airship had come from a daring heist of sorts, seized from the talented Tobey of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that unless absolutely necessary, he couldn't afford to reveal this ship casually; doing so would send ripples through the ranks and could land him in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To bolster his resources without drawing too much attention, he had also enlisted Hannah's help to secure an Ultimate Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spanning three hundred yards and boasting seven levels, it could comfortably carry over 100 thousand troops at a maximum speed of 300 thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Ultimate Malevolence Airship was certainly valuable, it was theoretically available for anyone with enough coin. Thus, deploying it wouldn't raise eyebrows or </span><span>seem too ostentatious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cry rang out as everyone arrived at the assembly point. The atmosphere crackled with anticipation. From the five top-grade Malevolence Airships, five imposing figures took flight, their auras radiating authority and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the leaders of ten thousand from the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Osborne's gaze landed on one individual in particular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That person would be his direct superior in the field.</span></p><div class="pagination">
