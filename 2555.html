  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Adriana needed his help, Osborne was quite surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana's strength and influence, what could she possibly need Osborne's help with?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out but still quickly told Adriana his location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Adriana showed up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Adriana, Osborne couldn't help but brighten up. He noticed her aura was more restrained, becoming even more mysterious, like an abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled, as if she had guessed what Osborne was thinking, and said, "Thanks to your Legendary Dragon Elixir, my strength has significantly improved. I've definitely reached new heights. And this time, I'm here to ask for your help, which is also related to the Legendary Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow upon hearing that. "Ms. Alba, are you running out of your Legendary Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded. "I originally thought twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir would be enough, but I found that even after twenty drops, it still works! For you, the effect might not be that noticeable, but for me... it's crucial!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, every bit of improvement in my strength is incredibly difficult! The slight boost from the Legendary Dragon Elixir is extremely, extremely important to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, do you have more? I can trade something else with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes were filled with longing at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had never seen Adriana like this before, and he immediately knew she truly needed the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked curiously, "Ms. Alba, didn't I give you two hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir? You only used twenty drops, so what about the rest..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I gave the rest to Isa, Clarissa, and the others!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are my disciples; how could I take their Legendary Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly a bit moved upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana needed the Legendary Dragon Elixir so urgently that if she just said a word, Isa and Clarissa would surely offer it to her first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana didn&rsquo;t do that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa found a good mentor, one who truly cares for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer hesitated and took out all the Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Phantomagic Realm, he obtained 200 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir himself and found another 200 drops in various Dimensional Bags, making a total of 400 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he had already given Adriana 200 drops.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gave Angela and Agatha twenty drops each, used twenty drops himself, and a few days ago gave Clara and Leroy twenty drops each.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne has exactly one hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Osborne planned to leave these hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir for his family, but their cultivation level is too low, and they simply can't use it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For them, Top-grade Dragon Elixir is enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They refused to accept it and insisted that Osborne keep it for emergencies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, it has indeed come in handy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana has helped Osborne many times, and he owes her a lot. At this moment, being able to help Adriana, Osborne naturally wouldn't be stingy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He handed all the Legendary Dragon Elixir to Adriana at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, this is all I have left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it enough? If not, I still have plenty of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and Mid-grade Dragon Elixir. If you need them, take them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's enough! More than enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn't hold back with Osborne and said, "This time you've helped me a lot! With these Legendary Dragon Elixirs, after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I'll be more confident in protecting myself when entering that mysterious place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she smiled at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want? Supreme Sacred Artifact? Superior Materials? Or something else? As long as I have it, just say the word..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need! I'm happy to help you! I owe you too much, these Dragon Elixirs are nothing, I don't need anything in return."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure? It's rare for me to be this generous, are you sure you don't want anything?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "I really don't need anything! If I must say something... I just hope Ms. Alba you can treat Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia better and protect them well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded. "Don't worry, even if you didn't say it, I would have done that! Besides, the Top-grade Dragon Elixir and Legendary Dragon Elixir you gave have greatly boosted them! I've already decided... to take them all as my personal disciples, just like Isa."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, only Isa was Adriana's personal disciple, but now, with Clarissa, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, and Kendra also becoming Adriana's personal disciples, that's just wonderful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "I should be the one thanking you! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have such excellent disciples! With them around, my Fairy Moon Sect becoming a top-tier power is just a matter of time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as they grow, no one on this Racial Convergence Planet will be able to stop Fairy Moon Sect from becoming a top-tier power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes were full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, there's one more thing I need your help with! Isa told me you possess incredibly rare time powers? Can you accelerate time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled. "Perfect, then do me another favor! I once obtained a treasure in a hidden place! This treasure holds the power of time, capable of steadily accelerating time in an area by thirty times..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is also the secret behind how I reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness so quickly! Time acceleration to a hundred times would be even better for cultivation, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"See if you can help me enhance this treasure's Time Acceleration to a hundred times! That way, I can let Isa, Clarissa, and the others train in a hundred times Time Acceleration and grow even faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded again upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'll give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana took out a bell-like Sacred Artifact. Osborne could clearly sense the time powers on it. After studying it for a while, Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Done! The Time Acceleration has been increased to a hundred times! However, it requires power to sustain and needs to be replenished periodically."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana took it, feeling very delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, these are minor issues! With this, the cultivation speed of my Fairy Moon Sect disciples can increase threefold again! Advancing Fairy Moon Sect to a Top-tier Power... feels even more assured now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana smiled and said, "I realize you&rsquo;re truly my lucky star! In the past half year since meeting you, I&rsquo;ve encountered more good things than I did in the past hundred years!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne immediately touched his nose awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not that exaggerated..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course it is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "In a few days, after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, we&rsquo;ll be heading to that mysterious place together! At first, I was a bit uneasy. But now, thinking that I&rsquo;ll be going with you, I suddenly feel no worries."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe this time, I'll come across something good because of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I'll head back to Fairy Moon Sect first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll come again during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, so take care of yourself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana unexpectedly reached out and touched Osborne's face, smiling softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could react, she had already disappeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
