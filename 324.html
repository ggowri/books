  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and watched the figures of Lauren and Yohan disappear in the waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, but ultimately chose not to take their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that he didn't dare do that, but that he couldn't do it for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had assaulted Yohan and Lauren, completely offending the Paltrow family, as long as he didn't kill them, the Paltrow family wouldn't immediately resort to relentless pursuit to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had time to continue improving himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, are you just going to send two lackeys to deal with me? Unfortunately, they are not enough! I wonder if you will come to deal with me personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or, will you wait until you break through to become a Class A master before you take action? Regardless, you and I will eventually fight, and it won't be long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing muttering, Osborne turned around and looked at Yulissa, Ryan and Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, his eyes fell on Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't expect that as Yohan provoked and insulted him, Ryan would be the first to stand up and face Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now began to doubt whether he had misunderstood Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face was a little red at this time, and he seemed extremely excited. The scene of Osborne ruthlessly attacking Yohan and forcing Lauren to jump into the sea made Ryan intensely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the one who was more excited than him was Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's eyes turned bloodshot as he looked at Osborne, as if he were looking at a naked beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are so awesome!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were so handsome just now, and it was so refreshing! Damn the Paltrow family. How dare they act so arrogant in front of us? I have been annoyed with them for a long time, but I am no match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you have done what I dreamed of doing. From now on, you are my real idol!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Nathan was even more convinced of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the younger generation of the entire Augustine family, who could face the younger generation of the Paltrow family with dignity and even take the initiative to beat them up? Who could force the youngest members of the Paltrow family to jump into the sea in a desperate bid for survival?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan couldn't do it either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne could do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Don't you blame me for causing trouble for the Augustine </span><span>family? You know, they were originally coming for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan shook his head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are the heir of the Augustine family, the leader of the younger generation of the Augustine family, and the future head of the Augustine family, so your troubles are the troubles of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We would never blame you and we can only admire you. The Augustine family hasn't had such a sense of pride for too long. Even if it meant going to my death right now, I would willingly do so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "It's not that serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The future of the Augustine family will only get better! However, I have merely dealt with two young members of the Paltrow family. There is no need to be so excited. What we need to focus on now is resolving the challenges faced by the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Augustine family is strong enough, no one can bully us anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he waved his hand and went back to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already the high seas now, and the mastermind behind the scenes might attack at any time. Therefore, Osborne needed to conserve his strength and be prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he brought along most of the outstanding members of the younger generation of the Augustine family. If anything were to happen to them, it would be a generational catastrophe for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The news that I boarded the Alisa Ship was not hidden at all. If the mastermind behind this really wanted to deal with the Augustine family, there is no way he would not take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, it will be tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing thinking about it, Osborne held the blood diamond again and began to improve his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A day passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed in his room, unaware that Ophelia and Evelyn had been wandering around the ship all day, hoping to run into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even know that Ophelia and Evelyn had actually followed him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if he knew, he wouldn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Ophelia was already a thing of the past, and she could no longer stir up any waves in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, night fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The huge Alisa Ship seemed so small as it sailed peacefully on the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye was slowly pulsating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danger is approaching!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately opened the Satan's Eye and looked in the direction of the danger. Even in the cabin and in the darkness, his vision was not affected at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he saw what he wanted to see three miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over there, there were more than a dozen pirate ships swiftly approaching under the cover of night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each pirate ship had at least a dozen fully armed pirates, carrying guns and cannons. </span><span>Excitement filled their faces as they stared at the distant Alisa Ship, as if they were eyeing a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it finally here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood up and put the blood diamond that had not been absorbed into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they real pirates? Or are they sent by the mastermind behind the scenes to probe us? Either way, their appearance is a good thing. It's not in vain that I personally act as bait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start with you guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he came to the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the rapidly approaching pirate ships, he snorted coldly and waved his hand to open the Dimensional Space.</span></p><div class="pagination">
