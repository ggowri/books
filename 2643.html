  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly summed up his gains this time, and even he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including the three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir he exchanged on the ninth floor and the three drops Clara and the others insisted on giving him, he obtained a total of 206 drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir. Besides that, he also has 2,000 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also has 20 sets of low-grade Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor, 3 sets of mid-grade Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor, 1 set of top-grade Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor, 20 low-grade offensive Imperial Artifacts, and 20 low-grade defensive Imperial Artifacts...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty boxes of Supreme medicine that can extend life by ten thousand years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty boxes of medicine to enhance talent and potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thirty-three boxes of Supreme medicine with powerful healing effects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also has the construction method for a level five Cosmic Translocator!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, Osborne also obtained the keys to the Seventh Skyfall Casket and the Eighth Skyfall Casket, the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, and the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most precious among them is, of course, the Apocalypse Bow. After all, it was once the strongest bow in the cosmos. Even if it&rsquo;s damaged now and only equivalent to a top-tier Imperial Artifact, its value is still immeasurable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next is the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then comes the top-grade Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor, which cost him a whopping one trillion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've gained so much!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne himself was surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, his abundant gains were inseparable from his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even Toby was surprised that Osborne could clear up to the twenty-seventh level, and each level was completed quickly, earning the most battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one else could achieve such gains, not even one percent or one-thousandth of his, like Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina had already passed the eighteenth level at this point but only received the minimum battle points reward&mdash;ten million battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She went from the tenth level to the eighteenth level, earning just over a hundred million battle points in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a hundred million battle points is more than 30,000 times less than Osborne's 3.33 trillion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's gains are less than one ten-thousandth of Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Seraphina already had the highest gains apart from Osborne, Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others couldn't even pass the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All their battle points were reset to zero, leaving no chance to redeem them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina, filled with immense excitement, placed her hand on the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A red glow enveloped her. Toby appeared before her, but compared to the Toby in front of Osborne, this one seemed much duller and less lively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby, I've cleared the eighteenth level! I'm here to get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was incredibly excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after her birth, she displayed extraordinary talent, catching Frederick's attention. He carefully nurtured her, all to prepare her for today&mdash;to enter the Celestial Spire and obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she finally did it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Seraphina herself knew how difficult this truly was. Thinking about how Frederick would value her even more from now on, she felt incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Toby's words left Seraphina stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "Although you passed the eighteenth level's trial, the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket cannot be given to you! Because the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket has already been taken..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Seraphina was stunned. Toby's words echoed like thunder, endlessly exploding in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket has already been taken!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone had already cleared the eighteenth level before her and taken the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina couldn't accept it. She gave it her all and finally cleared it, only to find she was too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Seraphina said excitedly, "Toby, who took the key to the Skyfall Casket? When did they take it? How could anyone besides me clear the eighteenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said calmly, "Sorry. That's classified, I can't tell you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was extremely anxious, but no matter how she asked, Toby refused to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Could it be that the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet not only took the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket on the ninth level but also the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket on the eighteenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're the only ones capable of this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina never suspected that Osborne had taken the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in her mind, Osborne and his group couldn't even pass the trial on the fifteenth level, let alone get ahead of her and clear the eighteenth trial first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina's face turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without obtaining the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, she couldn't explain it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it! This has nothing to do with me! It's not that I failed to meet Father's expectations... but the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket simply wasn't on the eighteenth level! It was taken in advance... This is an error in the intel. Father shouldn't blame me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this way, Seraphina finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I should use the battle points to exchange for something first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina adjusted her mood and began the exchange. Just over a hundred million battle points were, of course, far from enough to exchange for a low-grade Imperial Artifact, which required at least five billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But these were enough to exchange for several high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was quite a significant gain for Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, it had only been six days since she entered the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In six days, she had earned several Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina carefully selected the items she wanted to exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, outside the Celestial Spire, everyone, including Frederick, was eagerly watching the Celestial Spire, filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, Emiliano and Matthew were also eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And from them, Frederick received good news.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "Father, Seraphina has used her trump card to annihilate all opponents on the eighteenth floor! Even the two of us weren't spared!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina has passed the trial of the eighteenth floor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Good! Good! My meticulous guidance over hundreds of years was worth it. She didn&rsquo;t let me down and finally succeeded! By passing the trial of the eighteenth floor, she can obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was extremely excited. The plan he had schemed for tens of thousands of years was finally about to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists, his body still trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Eighth Skyfall Casket can finally be opened!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will, like my ancestor Solomon, gain power from the Eighth Skyfall Casket and successfully break through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, on the entire Racial Convergence Planet, I will be the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will eliminate all forces that could threaten the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I will venture deeper into the universe to pursue higher realms and greater power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Frederick looked toward the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was waiting for Seraphina to come out of the Celestial Spire...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a flash of light appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone emerged from the Celestial Spire!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked over excitedly...</span></p><div class="pagination">
