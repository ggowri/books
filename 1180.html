  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're actually going to use the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance your elemental essence? Are you insane? That's a complete waste!" Cain shouted, his voice filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was panicking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain had told Osborne to hold off on using the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity because he fully intended, once free, to get rid of Osborne and claim that energy for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing Osborne's insistence on using the core energy for something as "trivial" as enhancing his elemental essence, Cain felt a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a waste!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even understand how precious the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is? To use it for your elemental essence? You're out of your mind, and I won't allow it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained calm. "You won't allow it? Cain, if I recall correctly, this core energy belongs to me, doesn't it? I have the right to decide how to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, why is it a waste to use it for my elemental essence? Or do you have a better idea? Either way, I'm not planning on hanging onto them. I need to use them right away to boost my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a better suggestion? If so, feel free to share. I'm open to considering it, as long as it's something worthwhile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain felt his temper flare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." He stopped short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How would I know the best way to use this kind of energy? I've never possessed anything like it before! I just feel that energy of this caliber shouldn't be wasted on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cain didn't dare say that aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Cain's silence, Osborne offered a faint smile. "Cain, you seem awfully concerned about this energy. Are you worried I'll waste it? But it's mine to use, isn't it? Even if I do waste it, it's my loss. So why are you getting so worked up? Or... could it be that you want it for yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hit a nerve, and Cain's expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Why would I want your things? I just think it's a shame to see such precious </span><span>energy go to waste! But if you insist on using it now, go ahead. I won't stop you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, let me warn you&mdash;no one has ever used energy of this level to enhance their elemental essence! No one knows what will happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It might end up like your Divine Body&mdash;instead of gaining strength, you might ruin your elemental essence! And then, you really will become useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention, there's a real danger here. Forcing it might even kill you! I suggest you hold onto it, at least until you're more certain of success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain turned his head away, pretending he didn't care what Osborne did, giving off an air of casual indifference. It was as if he was saying, "But I'm just warning you out of goodwill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a small nod. "Thanks for the advice. But I've made up my mind. If I end up a waste or even dead, I'll bear the consequences myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne proceed, Cain felt the last glimmer of hope slip away. His anger surged to a boiling point, his eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could do nothing but watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! The core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity should be mine! If you're going to waste it like this, just wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I'm free, I'll not only kill you and take back what's mine, but I'll make sure to torture you thoroughly. That's the only way I'll get any satisfaction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain quickly masked his intent, careful not to let Osborne notice the dark thoughts brewing in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood there, unable to stop it, Cain could only watch as Osborne manipulated the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curiosity gnawed at him. He was also wondering what the consequences might be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would the elemental essence soar to unprecedented heights, or would it crumble into nothingness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's interest was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, steering a stream of the Lotus' core energy towards his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opted for the dark elemental essence over the spatial elemental essence, considering the latter more critical and fearing the potential for mishap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the dark essence were to fail, he could cope, but losing space elemental essence would be a grievous blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a silent prayer for no unforeseen issues, he guided the energy gently towards the dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark elemental essence sprang to life, quivering with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It lunged swiftly, swallowing the core energy whole before Osborne could even react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark elemental essence began to convulse, ravenously consuming the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the essence's transformation, a tumultuous shift he could not ignore.</span></p><div class="pagination">
