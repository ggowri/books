  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone connected the strange phenomenon that had just occurred with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this wasn't the first time Alexander had caused a strange phenomenon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was born, thunder and lightning raged, instantly awakening his mutant lightning powers. The second strange occurrence happened when he broke through to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying lightning storm swept in, completely flattening a mountain behind the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flat main venue now used to be that very mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Alexander had become the head of the Paltrow family, it seemed almost expected that he would trigger a third supernatural phenomenon. However, the scale was much grander this time, and its disappearance was far more mysterious than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who else besides Alexander, could have caused such a bizarre phenomenon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those seated in the VIP section, including Evelynn and Charlie, had grave expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlie, are you absolutely certain he was at the bottom of your 25th Power Prodigy Class? It's hard to believe someone with his abilities could trigger something so terrifying," Evelynn said, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie's face was just as serious. "In the 25th Power Prodigy Class, he was indeed near the bottom, but his talent wasn't actually bad. It's just that the Paltrow family was too weak to provide him with enough resources, and he didn't have a good mentor to guide him. As for this strange phenomenon... I have no idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn scoffed, "I think something's off. Even when my brother broke through, the phenomenon wasn't nearly as overwhelming. Does he really deserve this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think there might be other reasons behind this strange phenomenon. We should stay here a few more days. I want to investigate it thoroughly," Evelynn suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie nodded in agreement. "Whatever you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell silent, their eyes fixed on Alexander's succession ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander was bursting with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ceremony had triggered such a magnificent spectacle. How could he not be thrilled? This was a sign from the heavens, filling him with a newfound sense of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and thought, "I knew it. I am the chosen one! I'm destined to reach the pinnacle. Charlie? He was only better than me before because I hadn't begun my rise yet! And my rise starts now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, Alexander suddenly raised the lightning staff high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, countless members of the Paltrow family erupted into joyous cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they all dropped to one knee before Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their loud shouts echoed far and wide, pushing the atmosphere of the inheritance ceremony to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a long time later that the shouting finally ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept across the crowd as he stood atop the high platform, pausing on the Augustines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and said calmly, "I'm deeply grateful to all of you for attending my inheritance ceremony. I know I'm young and still learning the ropes, but I'll do whatever it takes to lead the Paltrow family to even greater success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for effect. "And now, I want to announce my first plan as the head of the Paltrow family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Alexander, eager to hear his plans. Everyone knew he was going to make something significant to establish his power. They were all curious to see what Alexander's first move would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, only the Augustines noticed Alexander's cold stare directed at them, which gave them a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alexander spoke, his voice cool and collected. "I hereby declare that the Paltrow family is entering the cruise industry, effective today! We will spare no expense in building a cruise empire, and within six months, we will be the dominant force in the Dampston cruise market!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His announcement sent a ripple of excitement and speculation through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that the Paltrows were going for the cruise industry, many shifted their gaze toward the Augustine family, their expressions filled with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that the Augustine family had the strongest hold on the Dampston cruise business. Especially after the recent maritime auction, their cruise business had not only fully recovered but had become even more prosperous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It brought in enormous profits for the Augustine family every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as the new head of the Paltrow family, Alexander's first priority was to pour everything into building up their cruise line business. And he was aiming to make it to the top in Dampston within six months?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a direct shot at the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With limited market space in the cruise industry, the only way for the Paltrows to grab a share was to take a bite out of the Augustines' territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustines' faces hardened as their fists clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's eyes burned with fury as he glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained unfazed, meeting his gaze with a teasing smile. He casually remarked, "Brian, why are you staring at me like that? Are you trying to say you don't agree? If the Augustine family can run a cruise business, then my Paltrow family surely can, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with the power of the Paltrow family, we'll crush your cruise business in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered disdainfully, "This is my first plan as the head of the family, and I'm going to see it through! If you know what's good for you, you should sell your ships and get out of the cruise industry while you still can. Maybe it's time to find a new line of business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or else, don't come crying to me when you go bankrupt. Consider this a heads-up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words only fueled Brian's rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, never one to hold back, jumped up and jabbed a finger at Alexander. "Who the hell do you think you are, Alexander? If you're so tough, go ahead and enter the cruise industry. We are not afraid to compete with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should worry about yourself instead! Don't come crying when you lose everything!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
