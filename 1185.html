  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill Cain! Seize his memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made up his mind, his heart brimming with excitement. This was the best solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, obtaining Cain's memories was no easy feat; most wouldn't even entertain such a thought, as it seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne harbored hope because he possessed Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Satan's Eye had reached Level Six, it granted Osborne the ability to manipulate memories, albeit only by altering them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The target had to be significantly weaker than Osborne for the manipulation to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This capability was far from sufficient to extract Cain's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's Satan's Eye had since surpassed Level Seven, unlocking a new ability&mdash;Temporal Stasis&mdash;and significantly enhancing its existing powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Memory Control had grown formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now stood a good chance of controlling Cain's memories during his demise, extracting them into his own mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a viable plan, yet there was a catch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's formidable past as a Deity Overlord meant his memories were still imbued with that power despite his current fragmented soul posing little threat to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "With my current Satan's Eye, I might not fully harness Cain's memories and integrate them as my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Satan's Eye needs to grow stronger for that to be possible. So be it, I'll enhance the Satan's Eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boosting the Satan's Eye was straightforward; Osborne still had seven cores of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Using one seemed justifiable, given how much the Satan's Eye had aided his growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to elevate the Satan's Eye&mdash;could it propel it straight to Level Eight? What new powers would a Level Eight Satan's Eye possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement mounted as he prepared to experiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly drew a strand of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity towards his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's expression darkened upon. "Kid, what are you up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coolly, "I've come up with a way to boost my power, so I'm giving it a shot. No need to worry about me, Cain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the core energy approached his left eye, Osborne felt a sudden movement in his right eye&mdash;his Medusa's Gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Medusa's Gaze unleashed a powerful suction force, swiftly consuming </span><span>the core energy before Osborne could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astonishment struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intended to use that core energy to enhance Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's Gaze, with its merely petrifying effect, held little value to Osborne against formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he hadn't planned to waste precious core energy on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Medusa's Gaze had taken matters into its own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Medusa's Gaze devoured the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, it began to absorb it wildly, and Osborne could feel a transformation taking place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it seemed that this metamorphosis would take quite a while to complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Osborne cursed inwardly, "You better make this transformation worth it and not waste that core energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, I swear I'll rip you out and toss you away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the core energy already consumed by Medusa's Gaze, it would take some time to fully absorb it. Osborne had no choice but to call upon another core from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne approached with extra caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wary of Medusa's Gaze's greedy nature and feared it would snatch away this new core energy as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, his worries were unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Satan's Eye responded quickly, eagerly absorbing the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt the power of his Satan's Eye begin to surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye was the legacy of the Augustine family, a potent ability passed down through generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, Osborne's Satan's Eye had been a unique anomaly, far stronger than those of other Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as it absorbed the core energy, it was rapidly evolving into something even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed that his recently acquired Level Seven Satan's Eye was nearing the cusp of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I about to breach Level Eight? I wonder what new abilities Level Eight will unlock?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
