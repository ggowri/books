  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Primordial's voice broke through Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, kid, you seem pretty excited!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Primordial, who are you calling 'kid'? Show some respect! You're the sprout here. Don't forget to treat me like a brother from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial retorted, "Ha! Call you 'bro'? You've got some nerve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I might be a young sprout, but in the grand scheme of my long life, I'm practically ancient! I've been around for over ten thousand years since I sprouted! So, isn't calling you 'kid' justified?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Over ten thousand years old? Primordial is practically an old-timer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne conceded, shifting the topic. "Alright, alright, you win. Just say what you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you still haven't told me why we're heading to the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot. We already checked it out, and there's nothing left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, are we really going to find treasures to boost our strength and cultivation level in Elf City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "We're heading to the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot to use the Spatial Translocator there to get to Elf City! While Elf City is the closest city to us, the actual distance is still mind-boggling! Without the Spatial Translocator, even with your abilities, it would take us years to reach Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's with your spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we could be on the road for decades, maybe even centuries, and still not make it! The odds are high that we'd end up dead halfway there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "A Spatial Translocator? Are you serious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with my spatial power, it would take years to get there? Just how far is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was astonished. With his current space elemental essence at the late Level Nine, he could easily traverse over 300 million miles in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could circle Celestara Planet in just a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, reaching Elf City would require years of travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How far could it possibly be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking it through, it wasn't that far after all. At least not when compared to the vastness of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the Spatial Translocator to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who built the Spatial Translocator? How can it transport us over such vast distances?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied casually, "You don't really think you're the only one with spatial power in this world, do you? You're a bit naive if you believe your spatial abilities are the strongest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are plenty of beings out there with far greater spatial power than yours! The creator of Elf City was a powerful user of spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Spatial Translocator is his creation! His abilities are far beyond yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the creator of Elf City still alive? What's his cultivation level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never assumed he was the only one wielding spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Gerardo, the King of the Aberrants, for example. He was also a user of spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Orion from the Lark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had gained his spatial power by defeating Orion and consuming his space elemental essence with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had yet to encounter anyone with stronger spatial abilities than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Space, one of the Seven Great Deity Kings from the Human Community, wouldn't be much stronger in terms of spatial manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely intrigued by the idea of meeting a warrior skilled in spatial power; perhaps a conversation with them could help him enhance his own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you asking if the creator of Elf City is still alive? How would I know? If he hasn't died yet, then he's still around!" Primordial replied, offering a response that was rather unhelpful, prompting Osborne to roll his eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial continued, "As for his cultivation level... well, it's definitely way higher than yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it surpasses even Lord Malevolence! He's likely transcended the Supernal Deity King level and entered the realm of Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness?!" Osborne whispered, the weight of the revelation sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above all else, the thought of reaching Empyrean Sacredness filled Osborne with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could attain that level of power, dealing with Lord Malevolence, the Dark Deity Legion, and the chaos in Celestara would be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness could wipe him out with just a snap of their fingers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a terrifying existence! I hope I never cross paths with one," he muttered, his expression turning grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that even with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity by his side, a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness could easily take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and Primordial continued their conversation, they finally arrived at the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What lay before them was nothing but a desolate ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's the Spatial Translocator?" Osborne asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a user of spatial power, he hadn't sensed any unusual spatial energy in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just ahead! You'll find it among the ruins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Spatial Translocator looks like this..." Primordial described its appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "This is the Spatial Translocator? It looks like just a rock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, he scanned the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for him to spot the Spatial Translocator. Just as Primordial had described, it appeared to be a dark stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there were countless similar stones scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What confirmed his suspicion was the intricate design etched onto the surface of this particular stone&mdash;a six-pointed star formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the star, there was a small figure with pointed ears, resembling an elf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, are you sure this is the Spatial Translocator?" Osborne asked, examining the stone closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still didn't sense anything extraordinary about it or any unusual spatial fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no spatial fluctuation at all!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial shrugged. "Of course, I'm sure this is the Spatial Translocator! The reason you can't feel any special spatial fluctuations is that it hasn't been activated yet. Plus, your spatial power is still too weak! You're nowhere near the level of the one who created this Translocator!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes but couldn't argue against that point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, how do we activate it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial said, "You can activate it with divine power! Given the distance it needs to cover, it requires a massive amount of energy! With your current cultivation level... even if you drained all your divine power, it wouldn't be enough to get us to Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even I could manage it! The distance is just too far! You'd need at least an Ascension Seven or Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King to have enough divine power to use the Spatial Translocator for a single jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, since you're a spatial power user, activating it with spatial energy will only require a fraction of divine power, allowing us to reach Elf City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are we heading to Elf City right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "Of course! We need to get going!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've only got a month, and you're not going to waste time thinking about it, are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and activate the Translocator! I can't wait any longer..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined nod, Osborne summoned his spatial energy and directed it into the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the device sprang to life, glowing with a brilliant light as it activated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
