  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, for most folks, saving Agatha right then would be a suicide mission. The power of that Frost-kissed Heart was running wild inside her, a terrifying force that even Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses wouldn't dare touch with a ten-foot pole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to rescue her could very easily get one killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was a whole different ball game. All he had to do was send the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into Agatha's body and devour the Frost-kissed Heart's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that power was gone, her own strength, plus the protection of those twelve little shields, would have her bouncing back in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne would walk away with the power of a Frost-kissed Heart to boot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, it was already a major win-win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Agatha's defensive Sacred Artifacts and that Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, Osborne wasn't exactly drooling over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First off, they belonged to Agatha. Even if he got his hands on them, he wouldn't dare use them willy-nilly. Otherwise, if the Ember Phoenix Clan got wind of it, he'd be in a world of hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he told them he found them after Agatha bought the farm, they probably wouldn't buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ember Phoenix Clan had serious clout on the Racial Convergence Planet, and messing with them would be asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Osborne couldn't even use the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a Sacred Artifact crafted from the bones of an ancient Ember Phoenix Clan powerhouse. Only someone with Phoenix Bloodline could use it and unleash its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the purer and more ancient the bloodline, the greater the power they could wield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne? Nada. No Phoenix bloodline. Even if he got his hands on the flute, it would be about as useful as a paperweight, not even as good as a run-of-the-mill quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that set of defensive Sacred Artifacts? They didn't exactly set his world on fire either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own defenses were already top-notch, and he wasn't exactly in the habit of using defensive divine artifacts. When push came to shove, he still had the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while Agatha's two Sacred Artifacts were powerful, they didn't exactly tickle his fancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This might just be one of the reasons why Osborne decided to save Agatha in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a swarm of blood-red roots erupted from Osborne's body and pierced into Agatha, who was as still as an ice sculpture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the roots began to devour the power of the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, siphon off some of her Phoenix Blood!" Primordial's voice boomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Why's that?" Osborne asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial retorted, "Look, I'm not trying to stop you from playing the good Samaritan, but I still think it's a boneheaded move! So, I figure you should at least snag some of her Phoenix Blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not gonna be a game-changer for her. She can always make more. But if you get it, you're in for a treat! Because I've got a sneaky little trick to blend her Phoenix Blood into your fire elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman's Phoenix bloodline is pure, like something out of ancient times. Her blood will definitely give your fire elemental essence one hell of a makeover. It might even give you a Phoenix Flame! And let me tell you, Phoenix Flame is one of the most badass flames in the entire cosmos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words definitely sparked Osborne's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mumbled to himself, "I'm saving your life here. Taking a little bit of your Phoenix Blood, you shouldn't mind, right? Since you're not saying anything, I'll take that as a 'yes'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Osborne looked at Primordial. "Alright, what's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes. "She's out cold and knocking on death's door. Of course, she can't exactly give you a thumbs up or tell you to get lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to pierce right into her heart and draw out the purest Phoenix Blood in her body. That'll give you the best bang for your buck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, but still double-checked. "You sure this isn't gonna cause any problems, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! I swear on my nonexistent grave!" Primordial declared with righteousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time. He steered the blood-red tendrils of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and plunged them straight into Agatha's heart. Instantly, he felt a searing heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scorching Phoenix Blood was the only thing keeping Agatha alive until now, allowing her to cling to a sliver of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was siphoning it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each drop of Phoenix Blood felt like molten lava coursing through his veins. Once it entered his body, it wrapped him in a blanket of warmth, all snug and cozy. Especially after it neutralized the power of the Frost-kissed Heart, he felt like a million bucks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough already?" Osborne asked Primordial after absorbing three drops of the crimson liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "Not even close! Keep going. You gotta soak up nine drops. Don't sweat it, she'll be fine. Draining a little Phoenix Blood might actually do her some good and jumpstart the awakening of her bloodline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and continued to suck in the Phoenix Blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after absorbing nine drops, Osborne felt like his body had transformed into a blazing inferno, burning hotter than hell itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the power of the Frost-kissed Heart he was also absorbing, which was working overtime to counteract the Phoenix Blood's heat, he was sure he would have spontaneously combusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial finally shouted, "Alright, that's enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep soaking up the power of her Frost-kissed Heart. Leave the rest to me! I'm gonna blend these nine drops of Phoenix Blood with your fire elemental essence right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a curt nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had mastered fire elemental essence a long time ago, but since he was short on energy, Osborne hadn't really focused on fire power. Nevertheless, as his cultivation level went up, his fire elemental essence had also been improving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was nowhere near as potent as his space, dark, and lightning elemental essence, it had still reached Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Six fire elemental essence used to be about as useful as a screen door on a submarine in Osborne's fights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Osborne could feel Primordial slowly dripping the nine drops of Phoenix Blood into his fire elemental essence one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could clearly feel his fire elemental essence going through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The improvement was insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fire elemental essence quickly caught up with and even surpassed his dark, space, and lightning elemental essence, reaching the peak of Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was just about leveling up, it wouldn't be that big of a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his fire elemental essence was pretty run-of-the-mill. Even with a higher level, its power was still weaker than his dark, spatial, and thunder powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne could feel that his fire elemental essence was undergoing a terrifying transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing heat was practically burning him from the inside out. If it weren't for the icy power of the Frost-kissed Heart to balance things out, he would have been screaming bloody murder by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much longer?!" Osborne gasped, his forehead dripping with sweat and his whole body as red as a boiled lobster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "Almost there! Hang in there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lucky son of a bitch! The power of the Frost-kissed Heart neutralized the Phoenix Blood's heat during the absorption, making your fusion with the Phoenix Blood absolutely flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for a miracle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light up, Phoenix Flame!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
