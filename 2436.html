  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice rang out. "Human, my child has chosen you. Take good care of her and don't let her suffer. If you can do that, I will protect you. If she suffers, you will die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice was pleasant but full of dominance and arrogance, as if a ruler who could decide </span><span>the fate of </span><span>countless lives with a single word</span><span>. It</span><span> was </span><span>like standing before a monarch</span><span> holding a scepter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Osborne felt his blood freeze. His body </span><span>locked in place</span><span>, and it seemed as if everything around him disappeared, leaving only that voice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until the voice disappeared that everything returned to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne suddenly realized his back was completely soaked, and the fear made his whole body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is speaking?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hurriedly looked around but saw nothing. He could only turn to Primordial and Flash, asking, "Did you hear that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial and Flash immediately </span><span>looked</span><span> confused, looking at him in puzzlement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? I didn't hear anything," Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne froze again, thinking, "Primordial and Flash can't hear that voice? Could it be meant just for me? What do those words mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could the speaker be Empress Kira, that Queen Bug? Is she not dead? </span><span>Is</span><span> her consciousness still alive </span><span>within</span><span> this drum before me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling as if a current ran through his body, Osborne felt fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, he calmed down and analyzed that sentence in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Empress Kira said her child chose me. Who is her child? Where is her child? Why did her child choose me? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Empress Kira ask me to take care of her child? As long as I don't let her child suffer, she will protect me? Otherwise, I will die?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, staring at the Drum of Empress Kira before him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Drum of Empress Kira was still the same as before, remaining semi-transparent. It seemed that no one else but Osborne could see it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized that he suddenly heard the voice only after the Drum of Empress Kira began to glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did I activate the Drum of Empress Kira?" Osborne murmured, "Could it be that Empress Kira's consciousness hasn't completely vanished and is still hidden within the Drum of Empress Kira? </span><span>But w</span><span>here exactly is her child? Could this drum be her child?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's face suddenly changed while he was deep in </span><span>thought</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He noticed that the Drum of Empress Kira before him had become somewhat different from before. The intricate patterns on the drum's surface were still there, but the shadow of the peculiar insect at the center&mdash;with eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, and a sharp mandible&mdash;had disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rubbed his eyes, then observed carefully again, confirming that the insect shadow on the drum's surface had indeed disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A deep sense of unease</span><span> </span><span>gripped him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if sensing something, he suddenly turned his head to look at his left shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a strange insect with eight legs, six eyes, and dozens of wings was standing on his left shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The insect's six eyes shimmered with light. It tilted its head, staring intently at Osborne with a curious gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, it suddenly lowered its head and fiercely plunged its sharp mandibles into Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Osborne wanted to dodge. But he found his body completely immobile, not even able to move a finger. He could only watch as the insect plunged its mandibles into his neck and frantically sucked his blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Osborne felt extreme pain, but he couldn't make a sound. He sensed a large amount of his blood being frantically drained by the insect, causing his face to turn deathly pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He screamed in his heart, "Stop! Stop it! Primordial, save me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to call for help, but he couldn't make a sound. If this continued, his blood would be drained, and he would die at the hands of this fist-sized insect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only pray in his heart. "Stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne felt his blood was about to be drained and his life slipping away, the insect standing on his shoulder suddenly stopped. It withdrew its incredibly sharp mandibles from his neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, that peculiar insect gently pressed its horn against Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>There</span><span>'s</span><span> more</span><span>?" Osborne asked in panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that after nearly draining his blood, the insect was about to do something else to him. But he couldn't move at all, nor did he have any way to stop it. He could only helplessly watch as the strange horn pressed against his neck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, what Osborne feared did not happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The horn of the insect suddenly emitted a red glow, which then flowed into Osborne's body. Instantly, Osborne felt an overwhelming sense of pleasure, and the wound on his neck healed rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, it felt as if every cell in Osborne's body was nourished and revitalized. His bone marrow </span><span>replenished</span><span> blood, injecting new vitality into his body and compensating for the previous loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>he blood being </span><span>replenished</span><span> was </span><span>even </span><span>stronger than his previous </span><span>one</span><span>. Osborne could feel that his body was undergoing some kind of change, but he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just felt incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne felt completely recovered, even more energetic and stronger than before, and even his </span><span>vision</span><span> seemed </span><span>clear</span><span>er than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on?" Osborne was utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wondered, "What exactly is this bug? It was just a phantom before, imprinted on the surface of the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after the phantom disappeared, it actually turned into a real translucent bug, sucking blood from my neck. After nearly draining me dry, it used its peculiar horn to heal and</span><span> help</span><span> me</span><span> recover</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this isn't just healing and recovery, but some kind of more miraculous transformation, a change that makes me stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this transformation, Osborne vaguely felt a certain connection between him and the bug on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could sense its presence more clearly, even distinctly feel its emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt even more confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne</span><span> realized he could move</span><span> his body</span><span> now</span><span>. He turned his head to stare at the bug on his shoulder and noticed it seemed slightly bigger than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, it was only the size of a woman's fist. But now, it had grown to the size of a</span><span> </span><span>man's fist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It sucked my blood and grew a bit. What exactly is it? Could it be...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but feel shocked. A startling suspicion arose in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could this peculiar little bug be Empress Kira's child? Did it choose me, and that's why Empress Kira asked me to take good care of it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the bug in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bug also looked at him with its six eyes, gently moving its head. At that moment, a cute voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Daddy."</span></p><div class="pagination">
