  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You... how did you get in here?" Alfred stammered, his body going cold as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Supreme Malevolence Airship is supposed to be impenetrable; how could this guy breach its defenses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him, his expression dripping with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred thought he was safe within the walls of the airship, using it to escape back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne didn't have spatial power, perhaps he might have succeeded, but unfortunately for Alfred, that was far from the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mastery of spatial power, Osborne could effortlessly prevent the airship from using its interdimensional travel. To him, the ship's defenses were nothing more than a paper wall, allowing him to step into the Supreme Malevolence Airship with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said casually, "I simply walked right in. You just said you wanted to take revenge on my sister, to make her beg for mercy at your feet. So how could I possibly let you leave alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a glint of menace flashed in Osborne's eyes as he began to close in on Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with dread, Alfred shouted desperately, "Stop him! Someone stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll reward whoever can hold him back when we get back! I'll give them a top-grade divine artifact! No, I'll hand over an Ultimate divine artifact! I'll throw in Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals&mdash;anything they want, I'll give it to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just do something, anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice echoed through the air, but the guards of the Bowman family were paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were pitiful Deity Overlords, while Osborne had effortlessly defeated mid-stage Deity King Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they stood no chance against him, and regardless of Alfred's tempting promises, all they could do was flee in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing their retreat sent Alfred deeper into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already gravely injured from his fight with Anastasia, and now he couldn't even escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet it made no difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fleeing guards of the Bowman family wouldn't survive, either. Osborne's clones swiftly closed the distance and dispatched them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time for you to check out," Osborne said, standing before Alfred, who, unwilling to await his demise, fought back with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against Osborne, his struggles were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne twisted Alfred's head sharply, a terrible crack echoing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted from the onlookers in Wild Flame City, their faces paling in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just any member of the Bowman family, but a key heir, one of the three chosen successes cultivated with enormous resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His status within the family surpassed even that of Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had killed him right before everyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was left speechless, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things are about to blow up! Theodore is utterly reckless to kill a Bowman family heir. The Bowman family will undoubtedly come after him with ruthless vengeance, launching a Stellar Pursuit Mandate across all of Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention the other members of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;they'll be seen as accomplices! The Paramount Supreme Clan won't let this slide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's brutal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne dealt with Alfred, the battle began to draw to a close. Many from the Bowman family, alongside those from the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan, tried to make a break for the last three Supreme Malevolence Airships, but Osborne cut them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only a handful of inconsequential figures managed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain lay in ruins, battered by the bombardments from four Supreme Malevolence Airships and the brutal conflict that followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it hadn't crumbled, it had become a grotesque scene of blood and death, littered with the bodies of the fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the warriors of the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan were nearly wiped out, the Mystic Feather Clan suffered devastating losses as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least 300 thousand of their members had perished in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, amidst their grief, the remaining members of the Mystic Feather Clan faced a harrowing decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to choose between staying or fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying meant they would likely draw the wrath of the Bowman family, who would undoubtedly seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, fleeing would feel like a betrayal to Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan, putting them on the wanted list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where could they possibly escape to? No matter how they decided, their future looked bleak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, go ask them if they're willing to leave. If they are, let them all enter the Dimensional Microcosm! If they choose to stay and atone for their actions, pledging loyalty to Lord Malevolence, then we'll leave them be. We need to get out of here fast!" Osborne instructed, his tone firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded eagerly. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned his attention to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, relieved to see they were unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had solidified the reputation of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, but it also meant they would now be in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would undoubtedly be hunted down relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had anticipated this outcome and was prepared for the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted toward the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to go! Otherwise, the City Guard and Wild Flame Army will be on us in no time!" he urged, urgency creeping into his voice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
