  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family wasn't known for their business acumen, and truth be told, Osborne wasn't a natural either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had a knack. He believed in leaving the specialized tasks to the experts and never presumed to instruct them from a place of amateurism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meeting, Osborne made three phone calls straight away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was to Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked her to come to Dampston right away, with the intention of putting her in charge of the Augustine family's cruise line temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison was a professional manager, competent ahead of a novice like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second call was to Austin, with whom he exchanged pleasantries for a while before getting down to business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He invited Austin to Dampston as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family, being a top-tier dynasty in Skyefall, also had a maritime business, but their focus was more on cargo transportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't ventured much into the cruise industry, which was the most profitable sector, not for lack of interest but for lack of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family's strength wasn't enough to compete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancient families of the region mostly controlled the cruise businesses in the ports of Rosmandi. The Montague family, despite a top-tier aristocracy, didn't dare to dip their toes into the cruise business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted to bring Austin in to foster a partnership between the Augustine and Montague families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family's experience in maritime transport could be a boon to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In turn, the Augustine family's influence could eventually help the Montague family to take control of the cruise business in Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a win-win situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Osborne's plan, Austin was exhilarated and immediately prepared to fly over on a chartered flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's third call was to Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With him handling the Chevalier family, Skyefall Security Services had once again become the premier security company in Skyefall. Plenty of professional security personnel had been approaching Skyefall Security Services, hoping to join their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The size of Skyefall Security Services had surpassed a thousand members, each a professional and a master in their field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called Valentin with the intention of entrusting the security of the Augustine family's cruises to Skyefall Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's own security team was decent but far from professional enough. Even if their cruise business were to be revived, their current security forces would be insufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They needed to invest in hiring the most professional security personnel available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne figured it would be better to earn that money himself rather than letting others profit from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he reached out to Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ending the three calls, Osborne returned to his room and began his practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, both Alison and Austin arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne brought them to the Augustine Estate to discuss how to get the Augustine family's cruise business back on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you sure no one will target the Augustine family's cruises in the near future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin asked earnestly, her demeanor that of a shrewd business operator, a negotiator in the midst of a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the way she looked at Osborne was serious, a stark contrast to her behavior in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, a bit taken aback by her seriousness, rubbed his nose and replied, "Yes! The </span><span>forces targeting the Augustine family's cruises have been neutralized. The masterminds should be too preoccupied to bother the Augustine family for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then. To revive the Augustine family's cruise business, there are three key points we need to address. First, we need to repair all of the Augustine family's cruise ships as soon as possible. Otherwise, with only three ships, even if fully booked, the revenue won't be significant. For an ancient family like the Augustine family, it won't make a substantial difference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded, "It will take five billion dollars to repair all the ships. The Augustine family can afford it. They've been hesitant because they're worried about further incidents after the repairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll approach The Wise Order to get them to fund the repairs immediately. With the speed of the Draco Group, all the cruise ships could be fixed within a week, ready to set sail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Now, the second point, and most importantly, we must restore the confidence of our target customers in the Augustine family's cruises!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family's cruises have had too many accidents recently, causing many casualties. Even if we repair the ships, it's useless if the guests are afraid to board."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "However, it won't be easy to regain the guests' confidence in the Augustine family. Normally, it would rely on time. Only if the cruises go a long time without accidents will the guests feel at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "How long will that take? I can't wait that long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin smiled faintly, "So, we must abandon the conventional approach. We need to come up with a way to entice the guests back onto the Augustine family's cruises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Entice the guests to board? How?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin shook her head. "I haven't figured it out yet, but there are a few general methods, such as reducing the ticket prices to make the guests feel like it's a great deal like they'd regret not buying a ticket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or organizing a large-scale event, something you can't find elsewhere, like inviting celebrities to perform on the ship. Their fans would definitely rush to buy tickets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the average fan's purchasing power is limited. The Augustine family targets high-end customers, and ordinary celebrities won't attract those people. And inviting celebrities would cost a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still thinking if there's a better way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's words opened up Osborne's mind immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that bringing Austin in for help was an incredibly wise decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and said, "Austin, what do you think about holding a large-scale auction on the cruise ship?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
