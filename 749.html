  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stood her ground, glaring defiantly at Stuart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension between them thickened, and the air rippled with energy as if they might clash at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, neither Aleena nor Rhett showed any intention of stepping in to mediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Emma back, speaking calmly, "Maia, let it go. Stuart is right. I'm indeed only Class AA. My main goal for going to Tethynia for the Honor Quest Ceremony is to broaden my horizons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to get going soon, or we'll miss the flight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, Emma snorted but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart refrained from provoking further. He had sensed a strong threat from Emma, and a part of him suspected that if they actually fought, he might not win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Stuart feeling rather unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had originally ranked in the top three among the younger generation of the Lambert family, but the sudden appearance of Axell and Maia brought unexpected pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain himself, Stuart sneered again, taunting, "Axell, you're still the same as when you were a kid&mdash;hiding behind your prodigy sister. Maia is already Class AAA, and you're still Class AA. Don't you feel ashamed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already backed down, yet Stuart continued to provoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Elder Aleena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serene smile, Elder Aleena said, "Axell, don't look at me. We are a Secluded Family. Our clan members live deep in the mountains, rarely interacting with the outside world, so they have plenty of energy but nowhere to expend it. That's why the Lambert family never stops internal conflicts among its members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This allows them to release excess energy on one hand and gain combat experience on the other. If you feel Stuart has offended you, you are fully within your rights to teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you win, he will naturally respect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Lambert family, strength is everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Aleena finished speaking, Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that Elder Aleena was explaining the rules of the Lambert family to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that the Lambert family not only didn't discourage internal disputes but actually encouraged members to compete against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart chuckled. "Ms. Aleena Lambert, do you think he'd dare defy me? How could someone at Class AA possibly dare to challenge me? Does he have the guts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Stuart looked provocatively at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew Stuart was intentionally provoking him, trying to goad him into a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you're nothing compare to Axell. I can defeat you myself! Stuart, aren't you arrogant? Let's have a battle, and I'll beat you until you're convinced!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma spoke up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was fed up with Stuart's repeated provocations toward Osborne and wanted to take matters into her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, he said, "Maia, Stuart's challenge is aimed at me. Let me handle this. Otherwise, even if you beat him, he still won't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been away from the Lambert family for so long that I almost forgot its rules. Since strength is what we respect, then things just got simpler!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took a few steps forward, facing Stuart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stuart, come on, let's see how much you've improved over these years. Or perhaps, has your skill stayed stagnant while only your temper grew?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne finished, Stuart's face darkened with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Axell, you've got a death wish! You dare challenge me? Fine, if that's the case, let's do it! I'll defeat you as quickly as possible so we won't miss the flight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Stuart's energy surged wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett and Fidelia both looked at Osborne in astonishment, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was merely Class AA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their perspective, Osborne's only option in the face of Stuart's provocation should have been to swallow his pride. Challenging Stuart would surely mean bringing shame upon himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he insane?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett muttered to himself, "He's been out training for over a decade. He might have sparred with some Class AAA warriors from outside. But does he think those Class AAA weaklings compare to Stuart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stuart is going to teach him a hard lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fidelia nodded in agreement. She, too, believed that Osborne was in for a harsh defeat at Stuart's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Emma wore a cold smile at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, opening his Dimensional Space and pulling out a super energy pistol, gripping it firmly in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't mind if I use a gun, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart was taken aback. "Spatial power? You've been out training for over a decade and actually awakened spatial power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile but offered no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart's expression grew cold. "Hmph! So what if you have spatial power? You don't stand a chance against me! And you intend to use a ridiculous handgun against me? Do you think I'm an ordinary person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Axell, I think something's wrong with your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll defeat you in one move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame! Dragon's Breath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Stuart made his move. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying pillar of flame, radiating an eerie blue-green glow, shot straight toward Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
