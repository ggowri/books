  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was indeed formidable, its potency far exceeding anything Osborne had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's dark elemental essence surged forth with unparalleled vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had just been a fledgling Level Three was now swiftly ascending to its peak, effortlessly piercing through to Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This transformation transpired within mere minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet it seemed nowhere near its limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, his dark elemental essence had soared to Level Four's zenith, matching the stature of his light elemental essence, and yet, Osborne felt a profound disparity. His dark elemental essence, though at the same level, was a titan compared to his light counterpart&mdash;ten times stronger, if not more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, without direct comparison, the imbalance had gone unnoticed. But now, Osborne perceived his light elemental essence as a sickly, undernourished infant next to the robust child of his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded. "Do I truly possess an extraordinary talent for Dark Power? Or is this anomaly a product of the Lotus' core energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, the augmented strength of his dark elemental essence was undeniably beneficial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger his elemental essence, the mightier his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had long neglected Dark Power, mastering only a single technique, Darkrift Corrosion Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its potency was modest, falling far short of formidable abilities like Destruction Orbs or Disintegration Rays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his newfound strength, coupled with his Level Four dark elemental essence, even Darkrift Corrosion Edge could easily dispatch any top-tier Class S. Facing a Junior Deity would likely pose little challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Darkrift Corrosion Edge simply wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he needed more potent Dark Power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered, his dark elemental essence continued its ascent, feeding voraciously from the Lotus' core energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, it breached Level Four's peak, achieving Level Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level Five dark elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic. He sensed that the primal energy was still far from depleted, yet his dark elemental essence had already soared to such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This granted Osborne a Level Five Dark Realm&mdash;solid, impervious to direct assaults, seamlessly integrating into the fabric of space-time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dark elemental essence now held the loftiest status among his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if by magic, streams of knowledge flooded Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes, absorbing this newfound wisdom, and his face lit up with sheer delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nightshade Wings? Abyssal Spiral?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the names of two Dark Power techniques!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's joy knew no bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he lamented his lack of Dark Power mastery, his dark elemental essence's breakthrough yielded these invaluable techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nightshade Wings&mdash;Osborne could now transform his dark elemental essence into vast, menacing wings, extensions of his very being, imbuing him with incredible flight speed and formidable offensive and defensive capabilities akin to Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abyssal Spiral&mdash;a terrifying vortex formed by dark energy, swirling with an insatiable hunger. As it spun faster and wider, anything caught in its grasp was doomed to be consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned widely, excitement shimmering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it&mdash;finally! Formidable Dark Power techniques! Both Nightshade Wings and Abyssal Spiral pack a punch far beyond the likes of Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays. I've made the right call to ditch light power to focus on dark elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with the core energy from Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity boosting my essence, I'm set! There's still sixty percent of that core energy left, which should catapult my dark elemental essence to the pinnacle of Level Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, damn, it's draining a bit slower now. Guess it'll take a few days to completely absorb this energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I'm not hitting a wall, I might as well work on my space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder if there'll be new techniques once it breaks through Level Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eager anticipation bubbling inside him, Osborne guided the remaining core energy closer to his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same spectacular phenomenon happened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the core energy approached, his space elemental essence began to consume it voraciously, rapidly climbing in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surged from the peak of Level Three to a breakthrough at Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he wasn't stopping there&mdash;he felt the energy pulsing, pushing it all the way to Level Four's peak, even hotter, rising toward Level Five.</span></p><div class="pagination">
