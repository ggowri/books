  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned, his eyes widening in surprise as he spotted a lovely young woman from the Human Community making her way toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, a smile breaking across his face, "Letitia! Good to see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia reached him, her expression brightening. "Hi! It's great to see you again! Have you settled in here in Elf City? Where are you staying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but eventually replied, "I'm at the Emerald Forest Lodge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emerald Forest Lodge?!" Letitia's eyes widened in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him into a corner, urgency lining her voice as she whispered, "Osborne, you can't be serious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you know the owner of Emerald Forest Lodge has crossed paths with Princess Monica of the Fire Elf Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "So?" She bit her lip, her concern palpable. "You really need to leave Elf City right away! My brother warned me&mdash;you've got enemies here. Desmond has a reputation for holding grudges! His apology was just a facade; he didn't mean it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's angrier than ever because you made him apologize in front of Joanna! And now that you're staying at Emerald Forest Lodge, it's like a red flag for Desmond and his sister! They'll have every reason to come after you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, you need to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of gratitude toward her concern but shook his head, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for telling me all this, Letitia. But I'm not going anywhere just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I fear them? I haven't done anything wrong! If they want to take revenge, let them come! I'm not one to be pushed around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia stared at him in disbelief, her mouth opening and closing as if trying to find the right words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she swallowed her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh dear!" She let out a heavy sigh, her demeanor shifting. "Osborne, I'm genuinely trying to help you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Elf City, after all, and the Human Community doesn't have much pull here. You've offended a prince and a princess of the Fire Elf Clan...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I've said my piece. If you choose not to heed my warning, that's on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, disappointment clouded Letitia's features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but recall what her brother had said about Osborne being too proud for his own good, coming from a small planet where he wasn't accustomed to taking any disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia mused, "Perhaps he will only learn the hard way&mdash;but will he still be around to learn the lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Osborne, she had to admit he was strikingly handsome, perhaps even more so than many from the Elf Race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her feelings didn't lean toward romance, she deeply cared for his well-being and didn't want to see him in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne seemed set on ignoring her advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I truly appreciate your concern!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have things to </span><span>do</span><span> in Elf City, so I can't just leave. Honestly, thank you for looking out for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a slight smile, he added, "I should head out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If members of the Fire Elf Clan see us together, it might draw attention to you, and I wouldn't want that! Let's hope we cross paths again soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved goodbye and started to walk away, but Letitia opened her mouth, as if she wanted to call him back, yet the words never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne was out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jaden and Renata approached, eyeing her with curiosity as they noticed her staring off into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden asked, "Letitia, what are you doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's caught your attention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia bit her lip, a hint of sadness shadowing her features. "I just ran into Osborne! He's finally settled in Elf City... staying at Emerald Forest Lodge! I tried to warn him to leave, but he wouldn't listen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden's eyes widened in disbelief. "He's staying at Emerald Forest Lodge? What's he thinking? The owner of that place has crossed Princess Monica, who happens to be Desmond's sister..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, concern etched on his face. "Osborne is in serious trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You tried to warn him, and he just brushed you off! If he's looking for trouble, then there's nothing we can do to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just forget about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In deep space, people die every day. It's best if we act like we never even met him. Come on, let's head over to the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word is, several Royal Families are recruiting young talents to form elite exploration teams. They'll be protecting their royal members while searching for treasures in Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We in the Human Community only have two slots for teams heading into Umbra Earth, and there can't be more than a hundred of us! There's no guarantee all three of us will get picked. Instead, why don't we try our luck at the Combat Arena? If we can join one of the royal families' exploration teams, we won't have to take up any spots in the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia nodded, although her enthusiasm was clearly waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her thoughts kept drifting back to Osborne, worry gnawing at her. She couldn't shake the feeling that if he didn't leave soon, he'd face retaliation from Desmond and Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh, she realized there was nothing more she could do for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been on his way back to the Emerald Forest Lodge to train when he noticed a throng of young warriors from various races heading in the same direction, their faces lit with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he leaned in to catch snippets of their conversations and quickly discovered some valuable information. "Combat Arena?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Royal Families of Elf City were selecting the brightest young warriors from all races to form exploration teams. These teams would protect their royal members as they ventured into Umbra Earth in search of treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as a warrior was a Supernal Deity King or above and under three hundred years old, they could prove their worth and potentially join one of these teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, they only had to surrender half of any treasures they found&mdash;keeping the rest for themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can get into one of those exploration teams, I'll finally have a chance to explore Umbra Earth! But with Desmond after me, getting selected might be a real challenge..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he thought, "No matter what, this is an opportunity worth pursuing. I should at least check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With multiple royal families forming dozens of exploration teams and looking to recruit thousands, not every family would turn him away just because he had crossed Desmond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I can demonstrate my strength and value!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination, Osborne changed his course, following the throng of eager young talents toward the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Combat Arena was actually the sprawling canopy of a massive Elf Tree, perfectly flat and expansive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, it served as a venue for sparring and competitions, featuring a dozen arenas of varying sizes spread across its vast expanse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, the atmosphere was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Royal Family occupied a different arena, scouting young warriors from all races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne scanned the scene, his gaze landed on the Fire Elf Clan's arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there he was&mdash;Desmond, right in the thick of it!</span></p><div class="pagination">
