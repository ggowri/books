  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes. He finally felt the real world, but he noticed that the world before him seemed somewhat different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne couldn't quite say exactly what was different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed clearer, more vibrant, more alive, as if he could feel the world breathing and pulsating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, it was just a feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne quickly realized it wasn&rsquo;t the world that had changed, but himself. His understanding and perception of the world had shifted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah, refreshing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial's excited voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Kid, what exactly did you just experience? This time was absolutely amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the voice faded, Primordial transformed into a small tree figure and stood on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial and was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's gaze, Primordial had also changed. His aura became incredibly powerful, such an aura...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You broke through to Empyrean Sacredness?!" Osborne said in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded excitedly. "That's right! I broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, and it's not just primary Empyrean Sacredness. I jumped three levels straight to advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! Advanced Empyrean Sacredness?! Why is your cultivation level improving so fast?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's cultivation level had always been similar to his, also stuck before Empyrean Sacredness. But he only took the Perfect Dragon Elixir and went into seclusion once. When he woke up, Primordial had actually become advanced Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What exactly happened?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or perhaps...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How long did he spend in seclusion this time? Could it be that he has been in seclusion for hundreds of years?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that's the case, wouldn't he have already missed the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Primordial quickly explained, "Why has my cultivation level improved so quickly? You should be the one to answer that! Shortly after you took the Perfect Dragon Elixir, your body started undergoing drastic changes. Countless patterns enveloped your body, and then your physique, strength, soul power, and so on began to surge rapidly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Especially your soul power, it went completely crazy! As I merged with your Soul Current Ocean, under the influence of your soul power, my cultivation level started skyrocketing uncontrollably! So I quickly broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, then mid Empyrean Sacredness, and just recently, I even advanced to advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides me, the Warfare Ancient Tree also gained tremendous benefits and grew significantly! After all, the Warfare Ancient Tree is also merged with your Soul Current Ocean..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial looked at Osborne, his expression full of surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Strange, why haven&rsquo;t you broken through to Empyrean Sacredness? I thought you&rsquo;d be like me and advance to advanced Empyrean Sacredness too! I clearly felt your power surging rapidly, and with that kind of growth speed, it&rsquo;s impossible for you to suppress it. Your cultivation level should have broken through by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, Osborne was already stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After taking the Perfect Dragon Elixir, not only did his power surge, but his soul power and body also improved drastically, even benefiting Primordial and the Warfare Ancient Tree greatly...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial even directly broke through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and quickly examined his body. As soon as he checked, he was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his body had become somewhat strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within each cell, there were mysterious patterns. Because of these patterns, Osborne felt his body filled with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like he could smash a small planet with just one punch!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne didn't even know what level his body had reached. Previously, his body was already at the advanced Sacredness Level, but now...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his body was countless times stronger!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was no longer possible to classify his body using the Human Community's ranking system!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now really wanted to find a physically strong opponent to test pure physical strength in a fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash is the Astralwreck Dragon. From birth, he was a primary Empyrean Sacredness, possessing an incredibly powerful physique, even capable of clashing head-on with the advanced Empyrean Sacredness Silicon-based Lifeform&mdash;Magma Devourer&mdash;for a while without defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's body is incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least the former Osborne, even with a body reaching advanced Sacredness Level, was far from being comparable to Flash's body in strength&mdash;they were worlds apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne really wants to have a hand-to-hand battle with Flash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once this thought emerged, it could no longer be suppressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne eagerly called Flash out, commanding him to transform into his true form&mdash;Astralwreck Dragon&mdash;for a clash of pure physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash heard Osborne's command, widened his eyes, and looked at Osborne, his face full of resistance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to be saying, "Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was, of course, serious. A hand-to-hand fight with Flash was the quickest way to test his physical strength. He quickly convinced the reluctant Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle-hungry Flash never bullies the weak!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne's overall strength might be impressive, but Osborne is, after all, a Human, and in the world of Racial Convergence, Human physical strength is definitely on the lower side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The body of any Beast Clan member, at the same cultivation level, is stronger than that of a Human.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he, as an Astralwreck Dragon, feeds on stellar cores. After reaching adulthood, his physical strength can easily shatter a star, or even destroy an entire Stellar Region or galaxy...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The body of an Astralwreck Dragon is among the top tier in the Beast Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a mutated Astralwreck Dragon...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His physical strength is even greater than most Silicon-based Lifeforms at the same cultivation level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wants to use physical strength to engage in hand-to-hand combat with him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isn't Osborne courting death?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne doesn't use the Sacred Artifact for defense, a casual swipe of his claws could tear Osborne's body to shreds. A light collision of his body against Osborne would make Osborne fall apart instantly...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he weren't unable to refuse Osborne's orders, he wouldn't want to bully Osborne, this 'weakling'.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Flash realized he was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he truly began hand-to-hand combat with Osborne, he felt the pressure. In the clash of physical strength, he didn't gain any advantage and was even forced back by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His claws fiercely struck Osborne's body, but it was like scratching hard rock, leaving only faint white marks without truly hurting Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he gave it his all, he could only barely suppress Osborne and couldn't defeat him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was hard for Flash to accept.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne wasn't even an Empyrean Sacredness, and Osborne's cultivation level was a whole tier lower than his. Yet, their physical strength was nearly on par?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash almost couldn't hold back and was about to unleash Dragon's Breath!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a series of tests, Osborne was incredibly excited and thrilled. His physical strength was not much different from Flash's now. Whether in power or resilience, he wasn't far behind Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such physical strength, even Osborne himself doubted whether he was still Human.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Humans are naturally physically weak...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior like Adriana couldn't clash with Flash using only physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne did it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a powerful body! Even Silicon-based Lifeforms would find it hard to surpass my physical strength at the same cultivation level, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because this would make his strength skyrocket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After testing his physical strength, Osborne couldn't wait to look at his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne was stunned again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
