  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light exclaimed, her voice tinged with urgency, "Wait! Osborne, don't be rash! Let's discuss the details a bit more before you make any moves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no time!" Osborne's voice rang out, cutting off the connection with the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, raising his hand to envelop them in a protective shroud of divine power, isolating them from the chaos around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, he addressed his comrades, "I'm about to go 'die.' Who wants to join me for a little taste of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, a spark of determination igniting among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you need us to do, we'll do it! Even if it means facing real death... we're with you, Osborne!" Anastasia declared with unwavering resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded vigorously. "We'll stand by you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's sweet, but I only need two of you to join me on this little adventure. The rest of you still have to stay 'alive' for the competition! Bryce, Diana, you're coming with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bryce and Diana beamed at the opportunity, nodding eagerly and casting triumphant looks at the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining group members exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! It's just a 'death' trip! Not exactly a walk in the park! Even if it's not real, the pain will still feel all too real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a glint of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope this works! If it doesn't, we'll have to brace ourselves for an all-out war. Who knows what will happen to the Human Community in Celestara then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he focused on the distant battle between the God of Light and Icy One's group, waiting for the right moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light was a bundle of nerves, her heart racing with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she maintained her composure, determined not to let Icy One and his allies catch wind of her distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Icy One was not so easily fooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked, sensing something was off. "God of Light, you seem a bit rattled. Ha! The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community must be done for! Your panic is futile... there's no hope left for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied coolly, "Don't count your chickens before they hatch, Icy One. Are you really not worried that Icy Six and the others might be taken down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One scoffed at the notion. "Taken down? That's laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know Icy Six's strength better than anyone. Even you&mdash;if Icy Six wanted to escape, you wouldn't be able to stop him! And as for those Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, they've got talent, but they're still just Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can't hold a candle to Icy Six! I bet he's already claimed their heads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's disdain was palpable as he looked at the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She retorted, "That's not a given! Osborne isn't just any ordinary genius! He has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He could very well turn the tables on Icy Six! Otherwise, why hasn't Icy Six returned yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he's already met his end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression hardened as he furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Why hasn't Icy Six come back? With his strength, along with Icy Seven and Icy Eight backing him up, taking down the Seven Young Deity Kings should have been a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it possible something unexpected happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced into the distance, but all he could see was a swirling mass of darkness&mdash;the Eclipse Realm&mdash;an impenetrable veil even for him, leaving him in the dark about what was truly happening inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very existence of the Eclipse Realm raised a multitude of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Icy Six would never unleash this realm on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who had created it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the Eclipse Realm was still active meant one thing. Osborne was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression darkened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that Icy Six! What a waste! He can't even handle a few mere Ascension One brats yet?" Icy One fumed internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, three figures burst from the shadows of the Eclipse Realm, and his heart raced with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six held aloft a blood-drenched "body"&mdash;Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of relief washed over Icy One as he saw Osborne's limp form. They had actually succeeded! They had not only taken down the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community but had also brought back Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a nagging feeling crept in. Something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrutinized the trio; their energy, their demeanor&mdash;it was all familiar, yet somehow different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's instincts screamed that these three were not who they appeared to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad! It's a disguise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where are Icy Six and the others? Could they truly be dead? And who are these pretenders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they trying to ambush me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They must be looking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's heart raced at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged within him, and he quickly sent a message to Icy Two and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Two, use your Eye of Insight! Find out who these three really are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two's eyes widened in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused his gaze, activating his Eye of Insight, then pretended to look away nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, you were right! They're definitely disguises! The one posing as Icy Six is that damned Osborne! The other two are also from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! They're somehow still alive, which probably means Icy Six and company are in deep trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each word, Icy One's fury mounted, his desire for revenge boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two said, "Icy One, don't lose your head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is actually our best shot! I may not know how Osborne managed to take down Icy Six, but they're trying to close in on us under false pretenses. We can play coy and let them think we're unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When they get close enough, we strike first and go for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can take out Osborne, it doesn't matter if Icy Six falls! It's worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One nodded, acknowledging Icy Two's cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good thinking! We'll act like we're oblivious to their little ruse. When they get within striking distance, we'll unleash everything we have. We won't give them a chance to breathe! If Icy Six and the others might have been lost, killing Osborne would make it all worthwhile."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they resumed their battle with the God of Light, Icy Two even called out without turning back, "Icy Six! You finally dealt with the Seven Young Deity Kings! Nice work! Come help us out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the disguised Osborne, playing the role of Icy Six, couldn't stifle a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I deliberately left an opening, and it seems you've noticed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to act nonchalant, waiting for me to get closer? Well, of course, I'll oblige! But now, you'd better make sure to finish me off next..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
