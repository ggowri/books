  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson led the way, with Osborne following closely behind as they ascended Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mountain was not just any landmark; it was the sacred ground of the Augustine family, a place reserved for only a select few of their kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been gifted this mountain by Sebastian after completing the sixth trial of his inheritance, but aside from a handful of people, no one else knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps even then, Sebastian had sensed he wouldn't be returning anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Mount Celestial Reach technically belonged to Osborne, he had never set foot there until now. As he surveyed the surroundings, unease washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Wesson guided Osborne to the summit, where a rather unassuming building awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It resembled a large sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon stepping inside, Osborne was taken aback by the ceiling, which was crafted from a unique transparent material that allowed sunlight to pour in, casting a soft, warm glow throughout the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this star power is incredible!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes wide with amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson turned to him with a faint smile. "You're right! The star power here is more than ten times what you'd find outside. The special material of the roof converts intense sunlight into absorbable star power and concentrates it, making it even richer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is where the Godfather trains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wanted to gift you this place so you could harness the abundant star power and rapidly boost your strength. Yet, you've never come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of regret wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by such potent star power, he realized that training here would have accelerated his growth exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had known, he would have skipped the dungeon and chosen this sanctuary instead. His current strength would have been far greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, Godfather didn't expect you to clear the Honor Quest Ceremony," Wesson added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved to a corner of the room and retrieved a finely crafted wooden box. "This is the reward he prepared for you before he left. He told me to give it to you only after you achieved fifty consecutive victories in the Honor Quest Ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seventh Inheritance Trial had seemed monumental&mdash;defeating every challenger until no one dared to fight him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Osborne felt Sebastian was placing too much faith in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he realized that Sebastian's expectations weren't as lofty as he thought. Even without clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony, simply achieving fifty wins would suffice for Wesson to hand over this reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of resignation settled over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if Osborne had known that the challenge was just about winning fifty times, perhaps he wouldn't have pushed himself so hard, and his current strength wouldn't have reached such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's inside that box?" Osborne asked, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression turned serious as he shook his head. "I don't know. Godfather only instructed me to give it to you after your fifty wins. He said it's something you need to bear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something I need to bear?" Osborne frowned, pondering the weight of those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson approached him, cradling the wooden box with care. "Now, I'm handing it over to you. This box can only be opened using your biological code&mdash;your blood, fingerprint, and iris scan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, if you force it open, whatever's inside will be destroyed in an instant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, taking the wooden box into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What could be inside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his anticipation growing, he quickly ran through various biological security checks. With a sharp click, the box unlocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he lifted the lid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, Osborne noticed a letter, its bold strokes unmistakably written by Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the letter were several documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of diving into the letter right away, Osborne pulled out the documents and skimmed through them. His eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped, saying, "The Draco Group transfer agreement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family's head appointment letter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Grandpa... he's handing the entire Draco Group over to me? And naming me the head of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his mouth, Wesson's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly scanned the documents, his face becoming serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, he said, "Long live the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Godfather?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried to help Wesson up. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, please don't do that! I'm not the Godfather&mdash;my grandfather is still alive, just temporarily unable to return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson shook his head, his expression grave. "No, you are the new Godfather now."</span></p><div class="pagination">
