  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Floyd, Osborne watched nearly a hundred candidates step up to the Astral Testing Arch, representing various races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most were Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, with a handful reaching Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Ascension Six? None had shown up yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they passed through the arch, the evaluations varied widely. Most scores landed below Class C, with at least thirty individuals managing to score above that threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noted that the overall score given by the Astral Testing Arch didn't directly correlate with cultivation level; instead, it seemed to reflect the individual's strength within their cultivation tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the multitude of Ascension Four candidates, two stood out with impressive Class A scores. Naturally, they quickly caught the attention of Prince Waylon and Princess Bernice, who were vying to add them to their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The competition between Waylon and Bernice wasn't overly fierce, but it was clear that their standards for selecting team members were set high&mdash;candidates needed to be at least Ascension Four with a Class A score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interestingly, they were also open to recruiting Ascension Five warriors with Class B ratings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, stroking his chin thoughtfully, "Is it possible that those 'special abilities' they keep talking about are actually tied to the overall score?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher the score, the more these princes and princesses seem to want you. It's like a popularity contest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, no one around him could clarify his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, it was Jaden's turn to approach the Astral Testing Arch, and Osborne leaned in, eager to see how he would fare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arch announced, "Jaden Dutt from Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Age test: passed! Cultivation level: Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, primary elemental power: water elemental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Water elemental energy intensity: Class C!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overall score: Class C!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden let out a sigh of relief upon hearing his Class C rating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving that score meant he had a solid chance of being picked by one of the Shadow Elf Clan's Royal Family members for their exploration teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced up at the raised platform, where the nine princes and seven princesses of the Shadow Elf Clan were seated, hoping for their recruitment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after what felt like an eternity, not a single prince or princess made a move to recruit him, and his spirits began to sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Shadow Elf Clan official said, trying to soften the blow, "Jaden, you passed the assessment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since your primary elemental power is water, it's not quite powerful enough to match the preferences of the Royal Family, so I'm sorry, but you've </span><span>not </span><span>been </span><span>select</span><span>ed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Jaden felt a mix of disappointment and relief. It wasn't that he lacked strength; it was simply that his elemental affinity didn't align with the royal family's interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed respectfully and stepped aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia encouraged him, saying, "Hey, don't be down! You did great! Out of over a hundred testers, only about thirty passed! You're strong! Even if you didn't make it with the Shadow Elf Clan, there are other Elf Royal Families you could join!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata nodded in agreement. "Exactly! You've got this, honey! If Shadow Elf Clan isn't the right fit, let's check out the other royal families together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden felt a wave of comfort wash over him but shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I didn't get selected by the Shadow Elf Clan, you two still have a shot! Why don't you give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going anywhere without you!" Renata insisted, shaking her head firmly. "Even if I pass the Shadow Elf Clan's assessment, I won't join unless I can be on the same team as you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden nodded, understanding her sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then! Let's head over to the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family and see what they have to offer! What about you, Letitia? Are you joining us, or do you want to try for the Shadow Elf Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia hesitated for a moment. "You know what? I think I'll stick with you guys. It'll be easier to look out for each other once we're in Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good!" Jaden replied, a smile breaking through. "Let's go check out the Sylvan Elf Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assessment by the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family continued, but the numbers were dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the hundred candidates, only about twenty managed to qualify, and even fewer were likely to be recruited. Many had passed the test and scored above Class C, yet their primary elemental powers weren't strong enough to attract the attention of the princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With sixteen royals aiming to recruit eight hundred warriors from the World of Racial Convergence, it was becoming clear that they might not meet their quota.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Shadow Elf Clan seemed determined to maintain their high standards without compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed the proceedings for a while, waiting until at least twenty or thirty candidates had been successfully recruited by the royals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd thinned out, he realized that the remaining eligible candidates had all completed their assessments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The princes and princesses of the Shadow Elf Clan stood up, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them announced, "Let's head back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This recruitment will last three days! After that, we'll venture into Umbra Earth for exploration! Tomorrow, any young talents from the World of Racial Convergence who believe in their strength are welcome to come for assessments right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the group of Shadow Elf Clan royals departed, taking with them the newly recruited warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days!" Osborne murmured to himself, turning his attention to the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family's assessment area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just in time, it was Jaden's turn to step up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sylvan Elf Clan's evaluation also utilized the Astral Testing Arch, and as Jaden passed through, his overall score remained unchanged&mdash;still sitting at Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family, a Class C score barely scraped by as passing, and there was always the looming possibility that candidates would be overlooked due to insufficient elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, within the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family, a Class D rating was considered acceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Class C rating and Ascension Four cultivation level, Jaden found himself in high demand, as several princes and a princess from the Sylvan Elf Clan were eager to recruit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of deliberation, Jaden spoke up, "I appreciate the offers, but I can't make a decision just yet. My wife and sister are also here to take the assessment, and I'd like to wait until they've had their turn before deciding. I want to join the same exploration team as them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words earned nods of understanding from the Sylvan Elf Clan royals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get your wife and sister through the assessment quickly! We hope they both pass!" one of the princes encouraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the Sylvan Elf Clan had a much more accommodating attitude. If he had made such a request to the Fire Elf Clan, he would have risked humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Renata! Letitia!" Jaden called out, beckoning the two of them forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata stepped up first, a hint of nervousness in her demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her abilities didn't quite match Jaden's, and she worried about passing the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Testing Arch assessed and presented a comprehensive evaluation of Renata's ability, resulting in a Class D ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class D!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata exhaled in relief; in the Sylvan Elf Clan, that score was enough to qualify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up was Letitia, who walked confidently into the Astral Testing Arch, her demeanor calm and assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Testing Arch compiled and revealed a detailed profile of Letitia, culminating in a final overall rating.</span></p><div class="pagination">
