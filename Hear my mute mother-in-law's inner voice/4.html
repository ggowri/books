        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hospital corridor reeked of harsh disinfectant, with noisy voices and hurried footsteps blending into chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I pushed through the crowded hallway, heading straight for Patricia's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside her door, nurse Diana Jones paced back and forth with a stern expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swept her sharp gaze over passing visitors, then suddenly locked onto me like she'd spotted prey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't go in. Just give me the photo album and I'll handle it," Diana said coldly, reaching out for the album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I stepped aside and replied calmly, "Patricia specifically asked me to deliver this to her personally. I should take it in myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face immediately darkened as she raised her voice: "Patricia's about to go into surgery. She needs absolute quiet right now and can't be disturbed by anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Other patients' family members nearby turned to look with curious eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I smirked inwardly: "Just as I expected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine. You'd better look carefully and make sure you don't give it to the wrong person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I handed the album directly to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana glanced down quickly, then gripped the album tightly, as if clutching some piece of incriminating evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone come look! This woman abuses elderly people and even had photos printed to deliberately upset the patient!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We all have parents, and we'll all grow old someday. How could you be so cruel as to beat her up like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers gradually gathered closer, their faces full of curiosity and shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana felt this wasn't enough, so she held the album high for everyone to see clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The woman abusing the elderly in these photos is this vicious person right here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Look, this shows her true nature!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouted while flipping open the album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd immediately erupted in gasps of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I felt secretly pleased but put on an innocent expression as I looked toward the album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about? This is clearly the family photo album Patricia asked me to bring. It's full of old pictures of her and her husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing my words, the anger on Diana's face instantly vanished, replaced by complete bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pulled the album back in disbelief, examining it page by page, unable to accept what she was seeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The album contained no evidence of me abusing Patricia at all&mdash;just sweet photos of her and her husband from their younger days, along with some warm childhood pictures of her and Thomas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the photos, Patricia smiled brilliantly, her eyes radiating happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this possible?" Diana stammered. Her hands began to tremble slightly, clearly caught off guard by what she was seeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Weren't you just saying I abused her? Where's your evidence?" I asked with a cold laugh, my tone dripping with sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face flushed red as she continued flipping through the album with shaking hands, seemingly still trying to find something to prove her earlier accusations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was nothing in the album that could prove my guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What I saw wasn't this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's voice grew quieter and quieter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers began whispering among themselves, expressing doubt about Diana.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be mistaken. This woman seems very kind," said an elderly lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right. The album is full of heartwarming old photos. Which one shows evidence of elder abuse?" an old man nearby chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fine beads of sweat appeared on Diana's forehead, her lips trembling slightly, unsure how to explain herself.</p></div>
