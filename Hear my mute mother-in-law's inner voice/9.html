        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, I shook off his hand and pulled out the divorce papers I'd prepared from my bag, throwing them right in his face. "Stop with the nonsense," I said coldly. "Sign them. Let's end this amicably."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas frantically picked up the papers, his eyes widening as he scanned them. Suddenly, like a man possessed, he crumpled them into a ball and screamed hysterically, "I won't sign! Isabella, I know I was wrong! I'll change, okay? Please, don't divorce me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice echoed through the hallway, drawing stares from everyone around us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I took a deep breath, suppressing my anger, and said each word deliberately: "Thomas, stop being so stubborn. Once Patricia's surgery is over, you'll be hearing from my lawyer. This is a decision I've thought through carefully, and it won't change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, I turned to leave. I didn't want to spend another second with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas suddenly rushed forward, trying to block my path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a man stepped in, extending his strong arm to push Thomas back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This middle-aged man couldn't stand watching anymore and frowned as he scolded, "You cheated on her, so why are you still harassing her? Why can't you just leave her alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas was already emotionally charged, and the middle-aged man's words made him explode instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streaming down his face, he screamed at the middle-aged man, "This is our family business! What's it to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Thomas threw a punch at the middle-aged man's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The middle-aged man wasn't backing down. He raised his hand to block Thomas's punch, and then the two men started wrestling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people around us were already disgusted by Thomas's behavior, and seeing this, they rushed forward to break up the fight. However, the scene quickly spiraled out of control, with shouts and curses filling the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the chaos, a terrified scream rang out, followed by the thunderous crash of something heavy hitting the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone froze and looked down toward the street below in unison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas lay in a pool of blood, his body twisted and motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana stood nearby, having witnessed everything. Her eyes were wide with shock, her face pale as if her soul had been drained from her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she let out a heart-wrenching cry: "Thomas!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, without hesitation, she leaped from the high building, following Thomas to their deaths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything happened so suddenly. Everyone stood there stunned, taking a long time to process what had occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people frantically called the police, while others whispered among themselves, their faces filled with horror and disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia's surgery was successful. When she woke up from the anesthesia and saw me sitting by her bedside, her eyes were filled with guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hesitating for a moment, she handed me a letter she'd written before the surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turned out that Thomas and Diana had cast a spell on me, allowing me to hear Patricia's inner thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas had wanted to kill me to collect my life insurance money for his illegitimate child's medical treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd been dissatisfied for years that I hadn't gotten pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas had no feelings for Diana; he only maintained contact with her because of their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Thomas's child being critically ill and Diana constantly manipulating him, he wouldn't have gone this far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing all of this, my emotions were incredibly complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia gripped my hand tightly and pressed a bank card into my palm, using gestures to tell me, "Isabella, I'm so sorry. Take this money as compensation from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I didn't accept the money she offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when I returned to the hospital, Patricia's bed was empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had left with Thomas's sick child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd also left me a message: "Move forward and let the past be the past."</p></div>
