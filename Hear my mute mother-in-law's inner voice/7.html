        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas stood frozen in place, his confidence instantly evaporating and transforming into stunned disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared wide-eyed at the indifferent crowd around him, seemingly unable to accept that his carefully orchestrated revenge plot had been so easily dismissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" His voice trembled slightly with agitation, his earlier confidence completely gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I took a deep breath, suppressing the surge of anger and disappointment, and said slowly, "Thomas, you really disappoint me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, I pulled out a thick folder from my bag and opened it with deliberate force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The first photo showed Thomas and Diana embracing intimately in a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second photo captured Thomas and Diana holding hands as they walked a little boy toward a kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The third photo showed Thomas holding that same boy, both laughing joyfully at an amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I held countless photos in my hands, each one documenting their happy moments together. The glaring smiles in those photos pierced my heart like knives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This can't be!" Diana suddenly screamed. Her whole body trembled as her eyes darted around frantically, as if searching for a corner to hide in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, I revealed more photos of them strolling through parks and secretly holding hands in hospital corridors. Each photograph exploded like a bomb among the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My God, they're despicable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They've been dating all along!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder Diana was always targeting Isabella. She really is a homewrecker!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Disgusting! She's the one who should be arrested by the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voices of other patients' family members in the ward grew louder and louder, their angry gazes shooting toward Thomas and Diana like arrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas turned pale, his lips trembling as he seemed to want to say something to salvage the situation, but his throat felt blocked&mdash;he couldn't utter a single word. Only now did he truly realize that his actions had been completely exposed, and fear finally crept into his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana sat on the floor, her eyes vacant, muttering continuously, "No! It's not like that..." She curled up her body, as if doing so could shield her from the surrounding condemnation and accusations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers grew increasingly enraged, with some even wanting to rush forward and teach them a lesson for their immoral behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amid all the chaos, I watched everything with cold detachment, feeling no pleasure whatsoever. I had once thought Thomas and I could build a happy family together, but that had been nothing more than wishful thinking on my part.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, this farce was finally coming to an end.</p></div>
