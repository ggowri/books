        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More and more people gathered around to watch. Thomas angrily shouted at Patricia, "Mom, are you insane? What good does framing me do for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia froze, her arms slowly dropping to her sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I suppressed my laughter. On the surface, I remained calm, but inside I felt absolutely thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, when I was falsely accused, Thomas didn't even give me a chance to explain&mdash;he slapped me across the face without hesitation. Now he was lashing out at his own mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I quickly stepped forward to check Patricia's injuries, inadvertently revealing the bruises from beatings on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thomas, what happened to these injuries on Patricia?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas was stunned too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could defend himself, a patient's family member behind us pointed at Thomas and cursed, "You look all respectable, but you're nothing but an animal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We should call the police! The cops need to handle this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ma'am, don't be afraid. We'll testify for you that it was your ungrateful son who hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was filled with righteous indignation, pulling out their phones to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now Patricia panicked. She had intended to frame me, but instead ended up implicating Thomas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kept grabbing people's hands to stop them from calling the police, but this only convinced everyone more that she was a pitiful woman who had been abused by her son for a long time and was too afraid to speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas trembled with rage, pointing at Patricia and roaring, "Say something! Tell them it wasn't me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speak up! I work for the government. If this gets out, my career will be ruined&mdash;I'll be fired!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, are you trying to destroy my future? I was supposed to get promoted this Christmas!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I sneered inwardly. He was so frantic only because he feared it would affect his job. Hadn't he been so confident that Patricia wouldn't speak up before? Now he was desperately forcing her to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Thomas was taken away by the police for questioning, Patricia was so worried she didn't sleep all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early the next morning, Patricia frantically gestured at me as soon as she saw me, wanting me to testify for Thomas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I impatiently interrupted her gestures and pretended to comfort her, "Patricia, don't worry. If Thomas is innocent, the police will naturally release him after they investigate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia's eyes darted around, and suddenly her gaze toward me became strange and unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the monitor suddenly let out a piercing alarm, and many doctors and nurses rushed into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterward, a doctor handed me a pre-surgery consent form to sign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Patricia's current physical condition is very poor, and the surgery carries high risks. If she has any final wishes, you should try to fulfill them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the doctor left, Patricia used her eyes to hint at me just like in my previous life&mdash;she wanted to see her husband's photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that I remained unmoved, she had no choice but to grit her teeth and write down her final wish on paper: [Before my surgery, I want to see my husband's photo one more time.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, I agreed and told her to wait peacefully in the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After returning home, I planned to randomly grab a photo album to deceive her. After all, in my previous life, I had been killed because of her photo album. In this life, I absolutely couldn't repeat the same mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I began searching everywhere for a photo album, planning to grab any random one and head to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unexpectedly, I discovered a file folder wrapped tightly in clothes inside Patricia's closet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment I opened the file folder, I saw something I would never forget for the rest of my life.</p></div>
