        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's hands trembled uncontrollably as she frantically flipped through the photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to believe that if she turned the pages fast enough, the nonexistent evidence would magically appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers whispered among themselves, their faces filled with confusion and doubt, with some beginning to question the authenticity of Diana's claims.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't let her fool you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana suddenly shrieked, "She must have switched the photos beforehand! She's the vicious woman who abuses the elderly! This album wasn't like this originally!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you keep saying I switched the album, where's your proof?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you be so certain there would be photos of me abusing the elderly in this album?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you witness it firsthand, or are you deliberately framing me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I questioned her coldly, staring intently at her pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's eyes shifted between the album and me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone couldn't help but mutter, "Who would be stupid enough to bring photos of themselves abusing the elderly? This whole thing is bizarre."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly. She's not that dumb&mdash;why would she publicly display evidence of her own crimes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right. How does Diana know what's in the album? Maybe she's maliciously framing Isabella."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face grew even paler. She suddenly looked up, her eyes filled with unwillingness, and said through gritted teeth, "Stop making excuses! I saw you beating the elderly with my own eyes&mdash;how dare you deny it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was sharp and piercing, carrying a hysterical madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I took a deep breath and responded calmly, "When did you see this? If you witnessed me abusing the elderly firsthand, why didn't you call the police on the spot? Why are you now using a photo album to condemn me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you claim to have seen it yourself, produce the evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, I'm calling the police directly. They'll investigate and find out what really happened!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flash of viciousness crossed Diana's eyes. Although the mask covered most of her face, her gaze remained as venomous as a snake's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly seemed to remember something and frantically pulled out her phone to search through it. Then she held up a photo on her phone for everyone to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember now! I took a photo!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look! This is the hard evidence of her abusing the elderly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please take a careful look&mdash;is the person in this photo really me?" I pointed at the so-called evidence and said to everyone, "You keep saying I abuse the elderly, but does the build and demeanor of the person in this photo resemble me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana screamed like a madwoman, "Stop talking nonsense! The woman in the photo is you! Her expression and posture are exactly the same as yours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She completely lost control, gesticulating wildly as she tried to incite the emotions of those around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't let her deceive you! She's so calm because she already switched the album!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She thinks doing this will cover up her crimes, but she didn't expect that the most crucial evidence is in my hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today I'm going to make you pay, you vicious woman who abuses the elderly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouted hoarsely, her eyes filled with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers began to doubt me again because of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, I remained completely confident and unafraid of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I looked directly into her eyes and said word by word, "No matter how much you scream, it's useless, because facts speak louder than words. If you can't produce real evidence, don't even think about framing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, someone suddenly shouted, "This whole thing is too weird! What Diana said before doesn't match what she's saying now. Is she deliberately causing trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were like a stone thrown into a calm lake, stirring up even more discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone chimed in, "You're right. This nurse is acting like she's gone crazy&mdash;she clearly has issues."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face instantly turned ashen, her lips trembling as she could no longer utter any words of rebuttal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her panicked state, I sneered inwardly, "It's time for this farce to end."</p></div>
