        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana collapsed on the ground, her eyes filled with madness and unwillingness, like a dying beast struggling in its final moments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've all been deceived by her! She's the vicious woman who abuses the elderly, and all these photos are fake&mdash;fabricated to frame us!" she shrieked hysterically, her voice particularly grating and ridiculous amid everyone's accusations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I let out a cold laugh, my eyes full of contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop making excuses. You're too stubborn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I gathered the scattered evidence and walked up to her again, viciously throwing a photo in her face&mdash;it was an intimate shot of her and Thomas together at a hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? This can't be..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flash of panic crossed Diana's eyes as she instinctively tried to cover the photo, only to find her hands wouldn't obey her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And there's this!" I threw another document at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think I don't know what you're after. Your son is seriously ill and needs a lot of money, so you set your sights on my insurance payout? You wanted to stage my accidental fall from the building, then live off my insurance money after I died? This is your comeuppance. Not only did you have an affair with a married man and destroy my family, but you also tried to frame me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this sight, the onlookers immediately burst into gasps of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's gone too far! How could she do such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's completely lost her conscience for her own selfish desires!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's accusations surged toward Diana like a tide, leaving her nowhere to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at this evidence, Thomas swayed unsteadily, as if all his strength had been drained from him. His eyes filled with despair and regret as he staggered toward me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isabella, I'm so sorry. I was wrong. I was confused and made this mistake. I don't love her&mdash;I was just seduced by her. For the sake of our years of marriage, please forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down his face, his voice filled with pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at this pitiful man, I felt deeply conflicted. The love I once had for him had long been worn away by all his betrayals and hurt, leaving only endless disappointment and pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thomas, how shameful! From the moment you cheated on me with her, we should have been over." I said coldly, my voice extremely detached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that I remained unmoved, Thomas grew even more frantic. He stepped forward and grabbed my sleeve, crying and pleading: "Isabella, I swear to God I don't love her. I was only with her because she gave me a son. You know I've always wanted a child, but you haven't gotten pregnant after all these years. I... I was just confused for a moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears streamed down his face, no longer maintaining his usual composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at him in this state, I felt nothing but disgust.</p></div>
