        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I pretended not to hear her and kept my head down, focusing on packing up my things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing no reaction from me, Patricia repeated herself several times in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I continued to act oblivious, which made her so anxious that she kept staring at me. Her intense gaze made my back itch with discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas was a typical workaholic who received countless phone calls every day as a matter of routine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't be away from his phone for even five minutes without getting restless, and when he discovered it wouldn't charge, his expression immediately darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was clearly becoming agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within two minutes, Thomas was ready to leave. Seeing this, I quickly grabbed my bag and followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Patricia, I've packed everything and double-checked multiple times. You're not missing anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If you need something, just text us. Thomas and I have to head back now&mdash;we both have early mornings tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia clutched the corner of her blanket and kept her head down without speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I deliberately asked, "Patricia, Thomas is in a hurry. Is there anything else you need? While we're still here, why don't you write it down on paper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at me deeply, her lips trembling, but no sound came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas grew impatient and shoved the notepad from the table into her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After much hesitation, Patricia finally wrote down "I want cotton bed sheets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, Patricia, I'll have someone bring them to you tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was about to pull Thomas away when Patricia suddenly grabbed my sleeve and wouldn't let go, insisting she needed them now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas completely lost his patience and took me to the nearest mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When we returned, I deliberately fumbled around, pretending I didn't know how to change the bedding, which made Thomas so frustrated that he did it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By coincidence, while Thomas was changing her sheets, Patricia was called away for tests and had no idea who had done it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like in my previous life, as soon as Patricia lay down, she began screaming in agony, pulling several bloody needles from her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctors immediately rushed into the room upon hearing the commotion, only to find her holding needles in one hand while pointing at me with the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Patricia pointed at me without hesitation, the last bit of hope in my heart vanished completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, her thoughts had echoed in my mind countless times. I could never understand why she would treat me this way, and I refused to believe she would deliberately hurt me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her accusation was as disappointing as the slap Thomas had given me that Christmas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I immediately turned to Thomas and asked, "Thomas, how could there be needles in the sheets you changed for Patricia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I know you're busy with work, but you can't treat her like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You're her son, and she worked hard to raise you. Now that she's sick, even if you're impatient, you can't hide needles in her bedding!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The onlookers immediately began murmuring among themselves, all looking at Thomas with condemning eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His pent-up emotions finally exploded: "I'm her son&mdash;how could I possibly hurt her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We all saw it! You can barely stand being in this room for a few minutes without getting impatient. How could you possibly change your mother's bedding? You must have done it on purpose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The family members of other patients in the room pointed at Thomas and accused him harshly.</p></div>
