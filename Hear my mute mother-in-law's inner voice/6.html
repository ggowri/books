        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With AI technology so advanced these days, even videos can be easily faked, let alone photos."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I straightened my back and looked around firmly, raising my voice: "During Patricia's hospitalization these past few days, I've been helping her with everything daily, and everyone has witnessed this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you all know how I treat Patricia? Besides, her injuries appeared under suspicious circumstances. This is a hospital&mdash;who could harm her in plain sight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My words made the onlookers nod in agreement, their gazes toward Diana filled with suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An elderly man frowned and said, "She has a point. During this time, she has indeed been caring for Patricia wholeheartedly, not like someone who would abuse her. On the contrary, this nurse has been causing trouble here unreasonably. Perhaps she's deliberately trying to drive a wedge between them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, Diana is too malicious. She just doesn't want their family to be harmonious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe she's a mistress&mdash;otherwise, why would she keep targeting Isabella?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She claims Isabella abuses the elderly and even has photo evidence. I think she's the one with malicious intentions!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Diana's face turned terrifyingly dark. She hesitated, wanting to argue back, but realized no one around believed her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the crowd suddenly stirred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I looked up and saw Thomas approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I hadn't expected the police to release him so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas strode through the crowd with a cold expression I'd never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at me and said coldly, "I just came from home and found videos of you abusing my mother on your computer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice wasn't loud, but it exploded like a bomb among the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's attention immediately focused on me again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas continued, "I'm her son, and I can testify that she abused my mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mother is mute and raised me through hardship. Coming from poverty, I knew from childhood that only college could change my fate and earn more money to repay my mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She once said the same things, but only to trick me into adding her name to the property deed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When my house was renovated and I wanted my mother to live with us, she threatened me with losing our child. She said if I dared bring my mother to live with us, she'd divorce me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She usually appears very considerate and kind, but it's all an act."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I looked at Thomas in disbelief, never imagining he would say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as I was about to argue back, Thomas shouted to the crowd, "This vicious woman also transferred all the money from my account and wouldn't let my mother have surgery!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Most despicably, the police have already confirmed that she planted the nail in the bedsheet. To escape responsibility, she framed me and pushed all the blame onto me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please everyone, be witnesses today and help me seek justice. We should teach this poisonous woman a lesson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his words didn't get the response he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone exchanged glances and whispered among themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone said quietly, "After all, this is a family matter between them. We'd better not get involved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, without evidence, we can't wrongly accuse anyone," another person agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is something for the police to handle. Why are you asking us to take action?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, you should just call the police directly. Why try to deceive us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas looked furious, clearly not expecting this reaction from everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching his frantic appearance, a wave of sadness washed over me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The once most intimate couple now stood on opposite sides.</p></div>
