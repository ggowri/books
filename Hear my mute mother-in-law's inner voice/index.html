        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though my husband's mother, Patricia Cooper, is mute, strangely enough, I'm the only one in the family who can hear her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day Patricia was hospitalized for surgery, I heard her inner voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[These hospital sheets make me itch all over. I wish Isabella could buy me some cotton sheets.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I immediately bought a cotton bedding set and personally changed them for her. However, I never expected Patricia to suddenly start wailing the moment she lay down. Then she pulled several bloody needles from underneath her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My husband Thomas Cooper wouldn't listen to my explanation and slapped me across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mom only came to the city because she's sick. If you don't want to take care of her, just say so!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The day before Patricia's surgery, her inner voice came through again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[I'm getting old. If I go into surgery, I might not make it out alive. I wish Isabella could bring me my husband's photo.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Following her request, I brought the photo album and handed it to the nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the nurse publicly berated me as a vicious woman. The album didn't contain old photos&mdash;instead, it was filled with pictures of me abusing Patricia and curse-filled writings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a daze, I was pushed down the stairs by the so-called righteous nurse and other patients in the room, and died from the fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in death, I couldn't figure out what was really going on with Patricia's inner voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When I opened my eyes again, I had returned to the day Patricia wanted me to buy cotton sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I'm going to pay the hospital fees now. Isabella will stay here to help you organize your things. If you need anything, just write it down and tell her," Thomas said before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia waved at me, pulled out a stack of crumpled bills from her pocket, and pressed them into my hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she pointed at my bare neck and gestured toward a jewelry commercial playing on TV, indicating I should buy myself a necklace too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Patricia couldn't speak, she had treated me like her own daughter ever since I married Thomas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I knew she cared for me, so I genuinely considered her my own mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honey, my mom treats you better than she treats me," Thomas said jealously when he returned to the room and witnessed this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under their watchful eyes, I suddenly felt my palms grow inexplicably hot, and the air around me seemed to thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, I was finally certain I had truly been reborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, after hearing Patricia's inner voice, I immediately bought cotton sheets to replace hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the moment she lay down, she began screaming in agony and pulled several bloody needles from underneath her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attending physician thought something terrible had happened and rushed in with a group of nurses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panicked, I quickly explained, "I just picked up the sheets from the dry cleaner, but I don't know why there were needles in them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They reluctantly believed me and told me to go home and return tomorrow for further investigation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as I was about to leave, Patricia suddenly clutched her stomach and writhed on the bed, revealing bruises from beatings all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor's expression immediately turned serious, and he called the police on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I grabbed Thomas's hand, trying to explain, but he slapped me hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was wondering why you were suddenly being so kind. Turns out you wanted to kill my mom with needles!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I frantically explained, "Patricia said she wanted cotton sheets, so I bought them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas sneered and immediately pushed me to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still making excuses? My mom is mute. How could she possibly talk to you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mom rarely comes to the city for medical treatment. If you don't want to take care of her, just say so! Why abuse her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I desperately wanted to explain that I wasn't lying. Even though Patricia couldn't speak, I could hear her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thomas had the police take me away without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After this incident spread, my company fired me immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I thought it was just a misunderstanding, but later when I brought the old photo album following Patricia's inner voice instructions, the nurse publicly exposed me for long-term abuse. In a daze, I was pushed down the stairs by the so-called righteous nurse and other patients and died from the fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in death, I couldn't understand why only I could hear Patricia's inner voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this life, I silently vowed to uncover the truth and seek justice for my tragic death in the previous life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I pocketed the money and casually helped Patricia pack her belongings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Thomas wasn't paying attention, I secretly switched out his phone charger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my previous life, he left in a hurry after receiving a company call, never understanding the real situation and completely misunderstanding me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, I wanted him to see with his own eyes exactly how his mother "spoke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hiding the charger, I bent down to organize Patricia's items according to the doctor's list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Patricia stared intently at my back, and the familiar inner voice echoed in my mind once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">[These hospital sheets make me itch all over. I wish Isabella could buy me some cotton sheets.]</p></div>
