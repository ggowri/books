  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios spoke coldly. "Of course, we can't just let this slide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan attacked us without provocation, slaughtering over a hundred of our divine warriors and wiping out more than twenty Divine Families, amounting to millions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This grudge must be avenged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the Deschanel Clan harbors grand ambitions to dominate this new world. Sooner or later, they'll become our enemies. It's either we destroy them, or we bow down to them. This battle is inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I can't decide how we'll fight it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be heading to the Mount of Gods to report this matter to our ancestors. They will determine our next steps! Rest </span><span>assured,</span><span> our Pantheon League has a deeper foundation than the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've merely survived by luck, and they can't possibly have more warriors than we do! For now, send someone to keep an eye on the Deschanel Clan. Once I return from the Mount of Gods, we'll decide on our next move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we have no choice!" one murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn the Deschanel Clan! Let them enjoy their moment; we'll take them down sooner or later!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want every last one of them dead!" a third voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Helios departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for just a second before quickly following him. He wanted to see where this so-called Mount of Gods was and to gauge the true depth of the Pantheon League's resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to learn just how many warriors from the Age of Gods had survived to this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more information he had, the better prepared he could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Helios returned to the Thornberry family's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had once been a bustling gathering place was now a wasteland. Just a short while ago, over two hundred divine warriors had battled in the vicinity, and the aftershocks of that conflict had decimated everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For miles around, the area resembled a scene from a post-apocalyptic nightmare, as if it had been bombarded by nuclear strikes repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew, however, that the Thornberry family hadn't lost many in the battle; they had retreated underground as soon as the fighting began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed there was a shelter down below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite his attempts to locate it with Satan's Eye, Osborne had come up empty-handed time and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he trailed behind Helios, Helios unleashed his divine power, sinking into the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dared not get too close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he used Satan's Eye to track Helios, who descended two miles underground, entering a river of magma, only to vanish mysteriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Osborne gasped, utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been keeping a close watch, and yet Helios had simply disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What's down there? Why do the Thornberry family members vanish whenever they get near this spot? It looks like nothing is here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity gnawed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried over to the spot where Helios had vanished, standing at the edge of the magma river. He scrutinized the area closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from the slowly flowing magma, there was absolutely nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This river looked just like any other magma river in the vicinity, and there were plenty of those within a few miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark red magma flowed lazily, and that was it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Strange. Why did Helios disappear here? Is there something special about this magma?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he entered it, he just vanished from sight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the river isn't deep enough to hide anyone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a growing sense of intrigue and began to search the area meticulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Osborne not personally witnessed the disappearance of tens of thousands of the Thornberry family members, along with Helios, he would have never suspected anything amiss. To his eyes, this place was as ordinary as any other, with no peculiar anomalies to speak of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lava flowed slowly, ebbing and flowing rhythmically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that my perception is dulled because I'm in a parallel space?" Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied that no one was around to observe, Osborne emerged from the parallel dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the oppressive heat hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for someone of his stature as a Junior Deity, such temperatures were trivial. He could wade through a river of molten lava without sustaining a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to meticulously sense the energy fluctuations in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that something was off here. Whether it was due to some inexplicable cause or not, the disappearance of over ten thousand Thornberry family members couldn't have been a mere coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever had caused their vanishing must emit traces of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if those traces were faint, he was confident he could detect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne methodically combed through his surroundings, and suddenly, amidst the fiery torrent of the lava river, his eyes locked onto an object no bigger than a fingernail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It resembled a small stone, inconspicuously concealed within the molten flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne detected a subtle energy fluctuation emanating from it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
