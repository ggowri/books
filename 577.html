  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing pain of having one's soul ripped apart was something Osborne was all too familiar with. It was a torment that went far beyond anything physical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his mutated Satan's Eye, which could rapidly heal his damaged soul, he wouldn't have stood a chance against Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Larry and the two other elders were suffering that same agony, their spirits shattered by the Death Sickle's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies trembled uncontrollably as they collapsed to their knees, unable to even lift a finger in defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watching was struck dumb with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Death Sickle twice in rapid succession had drained a significant portion of Osborne's soul energy, and he would need time to recover before he could wield it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, the job was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dismissed the sickle, his cold eyes locked on the defeated elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warned you to leave, but you chose to stay and test me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he delivered a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Larry and his fellow elders, too weakened by the soul-shattering attacks, had no chance to react. They were sent flying, blood splattering as they hit the ground hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Larry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Larry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ransford's fighters finally snapped out of their shock and rushed to help</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>F</span><span>ury </span><span>was </span><span>blazing in their eyes as they glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take him down together!" someone shouted, rallying over twenty fighters to charge at Osborne all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smirked, unfazed by the numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Larry and the other elders out of commission, the rest were hardly a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on then!" he challenged, throwing a punch with the force of a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine perfect waves of force exploded from his fist, surging forward like an unstoppable tide. The power behind the blow was overwhelming, strong enough to send even Sam reeling, and these fighters were no match for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those closest to him were blasted back before they even got close, hitting the ground hard and coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others' attacks barely made a dent in the shimmering aura surrounding him, causing nothing more than a few ripples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, fear gripped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Osborne head-on, they finally understood just how formidable he was. He wasn't just a bit stronger than Sam. He was leagues beyond. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His defenses were unbreakable</span><span>. Also,</span><span> Osborne</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s strength</span><span> was</span><span> overwhelming, and he commanded eerie powers that left his enemies utterly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> stood tall, like an unstoppable force of nature, overpowering nearly thirty of Ransford's best with ease. His attacks were precise and devastating, each blow sending opponents crashing to the ground, their strength meaningless against his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fought his way from the gates into the heart of the Third Estate, the cries of the fallen filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever he moved, Ransford's top fighters dropped like leaves in a storm, completely overwhelmed by his relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't fatigue that stopped him, but the fact that all of Ransford's elite fighters were now defeated and lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by the fallen, he stood with a cold, disdainful expression, surveying the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced toward the edge of the estate, where a group of Ransford's fighters</span><span> were</span><span> too weak to join the battle</span><span>. They were all looking at Osborne</span><span> in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them out of the Third Estate immediately!</span><span> </span><span>I'm giving you ten minutes.</span><span> </span><span>If any of Ransford's people are still here after that, don't expect me to be merciful.</span><span> Do</span><span> it, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like a death knell. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining Ransford's fighters trembled in fear, their eyes locked on him as if he were a demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no choice but to comply, scrambling to leave the estate as quickly as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Third Estate, the spectators were stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in disbelief as Osborne, single-handedly, had taken down all of Ransford's top fighters in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power he displayed was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew he could do it!" John murmured, admiration clear in his voice. "He's not foolish or insane. He's incredibly strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry, Tony, Kent, and even the badly injured Rodney were silent, their respect for Osborne evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sam and Lance were visibly upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! What does it matter if he's strong? With such arrogance, it's only a matter of time before someone puts him in his place," Lance said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam opened his mouth, as if to protest, but merely stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had begrudged Osborne's rise to the position of heir, but now he conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne had accomplished what he could not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame Dampston is so weak.</span><span> </span><span>Otherwise, he might have really created a miracle and become one of the top three heirs in the Augustine family.</span><span> </span><span>What a waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sam spoke, Lance's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a new group approached from the distance, their presence commanding immediate attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in lead was</span><span> in his thirties, wearing the Heir's Emblem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Matthew!" someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's he doing here? He's the second-ranked heir among the younger generation and rumored to be closing in Class AAA."</span></p><div class="pagination">
