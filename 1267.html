  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the fifty members of the Augustine family felt a surge of hope at the prospect of defeating Joseph, even killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their excitement fueled their ferocity, and their attacks intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Joseph was consumed by rage, but he felt utterly cornered. He had come to the Augustine Estate with confidence, believing that his peak strength as a Superior Deity would easily subdue them and force their submission to the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he found himself besieged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had fifty members who had all broken through to become deities, each boasting a Level Three Divine Body! The combined power of these fighters was overwhelming, and he was struggling to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, his divine power defenses were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fifty foes attacking Joseph simultaneously, his defenses were bound to falter. Despite his formidable abilities, he couldn't withstand the relentless onslaught forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wounds began to mar his Divine Body, and panic started to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! I have to get out of here! Even if I just bring back news of this battle, it'll still be a significant achievement! And if I can escape, I can call for help! There are four other Superior Deities in the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> territory who have completed their missions. If I can summon them, the five of us will crush these fifty Junior Deities without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a cold determination settled in Joseph's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had abandoned any notion of claiming all the glory for himself; survival was his only priority now. Joseph fully focused on defense while desperately seeking an escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's trying to get away! Stop him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face hardened. He poured every ounce of his strength into stopping Joseph from fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with fifty fighters, they were no match for Joseph's determination. If he was willing to risk injury to escape, they couldn't hold him back. Their coordination faltered, and Joseph quickly found a weakness in their formation, bursting through the encirclement, bloodied but relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was beyond their reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Augustine! I won't forget this! You'd better watch your backs, because I'll be back, and next time, it'll be your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's furious voice echoed in the air, but his figure quickly vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression darkened as he turned to his companions, who were eager to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't chase him! It's pointless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cast a shadow over the group. They were frustrated at having let such a golden opportunity slip through their fingers, allowing Joseph to escape instead of eliminating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he had pieced together their secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, he'll definitely return with reinforcements," Sebastian thought grimly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's brow furrowed with worry. "It's clear that our plan to stall is no longer viable. Joseph won't waste any time; he'll come at us with everything he's got to uncover our secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we have no choice but to go all in! I just hope Osborne gets out soon. If he's here, we might just pull off a miracle. He's never let me down before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muttering to himself, Sebastian and the others returned to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged information with Bryce, Anastasia, and the others inside the fortress. While Sebastian and his team remained on the ground, Bryce and Anastasia were poised to strike as surprise reinforcements, waiting for the right moment to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that there was no chance to delay the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle was on the horizon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't have to wait long. Just an hour later, Joseph was back&mdash;ready for round two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanying him were four other figures, two men and two women, each exuding an aura of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not quite on par with Joseph, they were still formidable, all wielding the strength of Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's wounds had now fully healed, and with a cold, relentless gaze fixed on Sebastian, he declared, "You failed to finish me off earlier, and that will be your greatest regret. I'm back now, and your end is nigh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you one last chance. Surrender and confess all the secrets of the Augustine family, and I might spare your lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you will all suffer the most horrific torments before meeting your demise&mdash;no exceptions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's words echoed with a chilling authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face darkened, his heart sinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst scenario had indeed unfolded&mdash;the arrival of not one but five Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the Augustine family, even with all their divine members combined, possibly hold their ground against such overwhelming power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds seemed bleak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet surrendering to the Deschanel Clan was not Sebastian's option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely resolve, he retorted, "Cut the crap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can make the Augustine family bow to the Deschanel Clan? You're dreaming! Let's fight if you've got the guts. Even if the Augustine family falls, we'll </span><span>make sure to take a chunk out of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression soured at Sebastian's defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hissed, "Very well! If that's how you want to play it, don't blame us for being merciless. Eliminate them!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
