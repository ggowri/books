  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely grim. He hadn't expected Isidore's reaction to be so quick. He had just rescued Uriah and the other two, and before he could leave Elf City, he was already discovered by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Elf City's defensive shield was so powerful that it completely eliminated the possibility of him sneaking out of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he was completely trapped in Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sublime Concealment Orb could hide his aura. However, if Isidore was determined to find him, Isidore would still uncover his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Agatha was still waiting for him outside Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the help of the Sublime Concealment Orb, Agatha's aura would quickly spread. By then, those top warriors at Empyrean Sacredness hunting her might track her aura again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne couldn't return in time, Agatha would also get into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought quickly. Sneaking away was impossible, and forcing his way out was even less feasible because he could feel how strong Elf City's protective shield was. Even if he used the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, breaking through Elf City's shield would be extremely difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth tightly, thinking, "I can only hide for now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he was in big trouble. Maybe the only way was to go to Elf City's translocator and leave through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Elf City, the Ethereal Elven Temple, and the major Elf Royal Families had hundreds of warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore could definitely guess Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would definitely send numerous warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level to guard the translocator, or even guard it himself. Osborne had no way to leave through the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, Osborne couldn't think of any solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only find a secluded corner to hide temporarily, using the Sublime Concealment Orb to mask his aura and avoid being discovered by the patrolling Elf Race guards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was only a temporary solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elf City isn't big. No matter how well he hides, he will be discovered sooner or later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe Mr. Rivera will have a solution." Thinking of this, Osborne immediately released Uriah and the other two from Satan's Eye's internal space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three immediately looked at Osborne after appearing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Rivera, Mrs. Rivera, Sherwood, I am Alfreda's friend, Osborne." Osborne greeted the three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Osborne in surprise. "You're Osborne? Thank you for saving us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile, "Mr. Rivera, it's too early to say that because my actions have already been discovered by Isidore. Now, the entire Elf City is on lockdown. We have no way to leave. Isidore is mobilizing all of Elf City's forces to hunt me down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we can't figure out a way to leave here, it might not be long before we're discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Uriah's face turned very grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shit! I forgot about the alarm system in Isidore's prison. The moment we disappeared from the prison, Isidore must have noticed immediately." After speaking, Uriah frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at the situation in Elf City, his expression very grim. He thought, "We barely escaped from the prison of the Ethereal Elven Temple, but we still can't leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Uriah's expression, Osborne knew there was no hope. But he still asked, "Mr. Rivera, do you have a way?" After all, Uriah was very familiar with Elf City. He might know another way to leave Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or, Uriah could first find a place where they could hide better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they aren't discovered, they still have time to figure something out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Uriah bit his lower lip tightly and didn't immediately answer Osborne's question but looked at Hilaria and Sherwood. "We might have only one way to leave Elf City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Hilaria and Sherwood's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uriah, you..." Hilaria said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah nodded and smiled, "Osborne is Alfreda's friend. He got trapped in Elf City trying to save us. We can't just watch him get caught by Isidore. So, we have no choice but to use this method."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, even if we leave, Isidore will definitely destroy the Elven Mother Tree. I can't let Isidore ruin the Elven Mother Tree. I must fight to the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if there's little hope, I must do everything to stop him. So, I choose to merge with the Elven Mother Tree to resist Isidore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Hilaria and Sherwood's faces were filled with worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hilaria said, "But the Elven Mother Tree has long said that you're not suitable to merge with it. If you force the fusion, you won't be able to control its power or open the passage to leave Elf City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Most importantly, if you force the fusion, your body will have problems. By then, you&rsquo;ll only have a few months to live at most."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lower lip, hesitating a little. Then, she firmly said, "If it must be done, the three of us can merge with the Elven Mother Tree together. This way, we can barely control its power and open the passage to leave Elf City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, if the three of us join forces, we can hold on for a longer time, maybe even until the day the Elven Mother Tree's power is fully restored."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, Isidore wouldn't dare to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, nor would it be possible to destroy it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hilaria looked at Sherwood. "Sherwood, are you willing to join us in merging with the Elven Mother Tree?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sherwood firmly said, "Mother, Father, I am willing. To protect the Elven Mother Tree, to stop Isidore, I am willing to give everything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You truly are our good child," Uriah and Hilaria said simultaneously, looking at Sherwood with affection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very confused at this moment, thinking, "What are the three of them discussing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Uriah looked at Osborne and quickly said, "Osborne, we have a way to send you out of Elf City. The three of us have chosen to merge with the Elven Mother Tree. </span><span>If</span><span> succeed, we can use the power of the Elven Mother Tree to forcibly open a passage out of Elf City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, since the three of us are not suitable for merging with the Elven Mother Tree, after merging with it, we will be trapped inside. Our bodies will also be gradually eroded by its power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can hold on for at most three years. Within these three years, if no one comes to replace us and completes the full merge with the Elven Mother Tree, we will die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the entire Nature Elf Clan, only one person is suitable to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, and that person is Alfreda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Uriah's expression became extremely serious. "So, you must bring Alfreda back to Elf City within three years and have her complete the merge with the Elven Mother Tree. Only then can you save us and stop Isidore from destroying the Elven Mother Tree. Everything depends on you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne said in shock, "Three years? I must bring Alfreda back to merge with the Elven Mother Tree within three years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure because he didn't know when he could revive Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But looking at the faces of Uriah and the other two, he nodded firmly and said, "Alright. I promise you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear, within three years, I will bring Alfreda back here to save you. By then, Isidore will surely be dead."</span></p><div class="pagination">
