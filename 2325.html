  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad laughed as he spotted Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally made it! Looks like luck's on my side&mdash;I'm the first one here, right next to you guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his amusement quickly faded as he fixed Osborne with a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's it going to be? Are you going to surrender voluntarily and let me take ten percent of your points, or should I just beat you down and take them myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you ten seconds to decide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse, don't think I'll go easy on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a smug smile spread across Conrad's face. He was clearly relishing the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled; he hadn't expected Conrad to be the first to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, Conrad, your arrival just proves how connected we are. You see it as good luck, but I'd say... your luck just ran out! Here's the deal&mdash;surrender, give me ten percent of your points, and I won't touch you. That way, you might just cling to a spot in the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you could end up battered and have your points snatched by other competitors, and you might not even make the top twenty at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished, Conrad's face clouded over with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You arrogant little punk! You haven't changed a bit! I thought you were done for, but here you are&mdash;alive and well, and with a stash of points to boot! Looks like fortune's smiling on you... but it won't matter how many points you have if you can't back them up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's your turn to taste defeat. I'll take your points and wipe that smug look off your face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Conrad started barking orders, "All of you, attack as one and finish them off fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we wait for other powerful teams to show up, we're in deep trouble. Let this arrogant punk know what happens when he crosses me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Conrad charged forward, Clara and Leroy's faces grew solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ready to fight back, but Osborne stepped in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was ranked fifteenth on the strength leaderboard, and all four of his teammates were among the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined might far exceeded that of Jared's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Clara and Leroy's capabilities, they'd be hard-pressed to stand up to Conrad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll deal with this!" Osborne declared, pulling out his Bloodwrought Bow with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to Conrad, "Conrad, since you're too stubborn to give up, let's settle this with brute force. I'll take you down with three arrows. If you can withstand them, I'll hand over my points willingly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidently, Osborne drew back the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant Sacred Power arrow glimmered on the string, aimed straight at Conrad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's expression hardened slightly as he sensed a faint threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, remembering that Osborne was ranked one hundred eighth, he quickly dismissed it as just his imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three arrows? You're full of crap! Quit kidding yourself. Whether it's three, thirty, or even three hundred arrows, you won't be able to break through my defenses. Any one of my teammates could wipe the floor with you, let alone me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a composed smile, "Really? How about you have a taste of the might of my first arrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he loosed the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow rocketed forward at breakneck speed, reaching Conrad in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Conrad was confident, he was also prudent. He knew that one should spare no effort even when dealing with a minor opponent. So, despite thinking Osborne posed no real threat, he activated his defensive Sacred Artifact, determined to safeguard himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out Conrad's caution was a lifesaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Sacred Power arrow streaked towards him at a speed far beyond what he had anticipated. Before Conrad could react, it crashed into his defensive barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion reverberated through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was plunged into a state of utter panic as he realized the defense of his Sacred Artifact had cracked. The arrow's force was so overwhelming that it almost pierced through and struck him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split-second, a shiver of fear ran down Conrad's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't activated his defensive Sacred Artifact in advance, he would have been defeated already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grim. That single arrow had already put him under tremendous pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier sense of threat was no longer just a fleeting feeling; he had seriously underestimated Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden impulse to flee seized him, but he knew he couldn't run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their history, Osborne would surely chase after him, and turning his back on an expert archer would be suicidal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Conrad's face contorted with fury. "Damn it! How could I have been so blind to underestimate you? But if you think you can beat me, you're delusional! Attack as one&mdash;let's crush him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Conrad roared those words, he let loose a crazy amount of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teammates didn't waste a second and did the same thing right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew there was no backing out now. If they wanted to get out of this alive and unhurt, they had to take Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of those five top-notch fighters shook the whole battlefield. Their energy zapped through the air. Even Clara and Leroy, who were standing behind Osborne, got the shivers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five guys were total pros with their Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any of their attacks could be a real game-changer.</span><br><span>Could Osborne really hold up against them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two ladies looked at each other, all worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was as cool as a cucumber like he knew exactly what was going on. There was this cold smile on his face as he pulled back the Bloodwrought Bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the arrow made of Sacred Power was shining even brighter than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my second shot!" Osborne said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the five attackers could reach him, he let go of the bowstring with determination. The arrow shot forward, breaking through their combined attack like it was nothing. Then it went straight for Conrad, fast and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's eyes widened in fear. He felt this cold, scary feeling take over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, no!" Conrad let out a hoarse yell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice quivered with a mix of rage and terror, and his face was flushed scarlet. "How the hell can you be this freaking strong? You're only at the 108th rank! I'm the 15th! I'm leagues above you. There's just no way in hell you can take me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic had completely taken over Conrad. He frantically funneled every last ounce of his energy into his defensive Sacred Artifact, silently begging it to hold up against Osborne's insane arrow. His teammates quickly stepped up, activating their own abilities in a desperate bid to reinforce the defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all their efforts were in vain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow sliced through their defenses as effortlessly as a hot knife through butter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It crashed right into Conrad's Sacred Artifact with a thunderous impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large fissure appeared on Conrad's protective Sacred Artifact, and it looked as if it would shatter into a million pieces any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy he'd mustered for the defense fizzled out in an instant as the overwhelming force of the arrow slammed into Conrad's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad stared down at the massive, bleeding hole in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide, filled with nothing but shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he crumpled to the ground before he even had a chance to process what was happening.</span></p><div class="pagination">
