  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne regained his composure and immediately launched two punches at the two Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deadly Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Tauren tried to stop, but it was too late. As they charged at Osborne, they were struck by his punches at the same moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force penetrated their tough hides, entering their bodies and destroying their internal organs and brains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The life in their eyes quickly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Tauren fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also sent flying from their impact. He coughed up more blood, feeling more of his ribs breaking. His body was now in a severely damaged state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing the three dead Tauren, he couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally relaxed. Although seven enemies remained, only five still had the strength to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Medusa and one Werewolf had already used their ultimate moves. They were now extremely weak and posed no threat to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had paid a heavy price for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries were severe. He had countless broken bones. His body was covered in wounds, with blood gushing out everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also extremely weak now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly focused on the second Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I can force her to use her ultimate move, I'll win this battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne dragged his battered body and quickly charged at Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's expression changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Petrification!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes emitted a bright light as she tried to petrify Osborne, hoping to slow him </span><span>down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it had no effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This basic petrification skill was now useless against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, stop him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa shouted, hoping the remaining two Titans and two Werewolves could keep Osborne occupied so she could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had his sights set on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care about the damage from the others. He relentlessly attacked </span><span>Medusa,</span><span> his eyes bloodshot as if he was out for blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was terrified now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was like a madman, clinging to her. She couldn't escape or create any distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she had no choice but to use her ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ashes of Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne's body was petrified again. Medusa immediately tried to use this chance to create some distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't give her the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Medusa used her ultimate move, Osborne quickly cast Light of Redemption on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beam of light descended from the sky and entered his body, instantly undoing the petrification and healing his injuries. Even his spent strength and energy were restored to their peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Medusa was now extremely weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the situation, there was no way Osborne would miss this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed a powerful punch at Medusa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's head exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the remaining Werewolves and Titan, who still had some fight in them, stopped. Seeing Osborne back at full strength, fear filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they continue the fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten of them, all Class AAA, had ganged up on Osborne. Yet in such a short time, four were dead, and two were too weakened to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only four of them left, how could they stand against Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitation and fear began to creep into their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! As expected, you're all worthless! Half-baked products can't be relied on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Luca spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne and said calmly, "Osborne, you do have some skill. It wasn't a waste to lure you here. If I don't kill you soon and let you keep growing, you might actually become a threat to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Luca slowly walked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, today you still have to die! You can consider it an honor to die by my hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're confident? You're just Class AAA. What are you so proud of? They weren't a match for me even when they teamed up, and you think you can kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca chuckled. "I told you, don't compare me to those worthless things! They're just half-finished products, at best Class AAA in name only.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think that beating them means you can survive me, you're mistaken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you down with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Luca stopped a hundred yards from Osborne. He reached out, and a large axe appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive axe radiating terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the power and his expression changed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A divine artifact?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
