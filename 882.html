  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie's announcement ignited a spark of excitement among the challengers from the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, their moment had come!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were known as the Godsons of Blue Planet, a prestigious title that placed them among the strongest young talents in the world. Climbing the Godson Rankings was an honor they wore like a badge.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though many of them understood that Osborne had just taken down Emi with a single strike&mdash;and that, deep down, they were likely no match for him&mdash;they were undeterred.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fearless in the face of strong opponents, they had earned their titles through grit and relentless challenges.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the contender who ranked 500 on the Godson Rankings stepped onto the platform.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family let out collective sighs.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The real test was about to begin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worry etched on their faces, they glanced at Osborne. With only twenty consecutive wins under his belt, he now faced the daunting task of defeating thirty Godsons to reach that elusive fifty-win mark.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To them, it felt nearly impossible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Osborne was undeniably powerful, every fight drained his energy. If he exhausted himself too much, his performance would inevitably decline.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would Osborne even have a shot at completing his fifty wins?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doubts clouded the minds of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne felt a surge of happiness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His goal had never been just to reach fifty wins or even a hundred. He aimed to defeat every challenger until no one dared to face him, to conquer the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, fewer challengers meant better odds. While each fight consumed a bit of his strength, he'd rather face fewer opponents.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sadly, the Augustine family had no inkling of Osborne's true mindset; they might have thought he was out of his mind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Sebastian had only managed ninety-five consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the past two hundred years, a mere nine individuals had completed a hundred wins during the Honor Quest Ceremony, and only three had perfectly cleared it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those three had become legendary figures, each ranking among the top ten in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let the challenges begin!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the battles resumed, the challengers from Blue Planet's Godson Rankings stepped forward. However, their strength was largely comparable to Emi's, perhaps even slightly weaker.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A month ago, defeating such opponents would have drained Osborne's energy and required him to reveal his trump cards.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, their strength felt like child's play.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their defenses and realms crumbled before Osborne with alarming ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift movement, he dispatched his opponent in a single blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since his challenger wasn't from the League of Divine Descent, he moderated his power, ensuring his opponent was simply knocked out of the ring without injury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sheer control Osborne exhibited over his strength left many onlookers in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challengers from the Godson Rankings took turns ascending the platform to face Osborne, each one hoping to be the one to topple the formidable contender.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the results were nothing short of staggering. One by one, they fell, either sent flying out of the ring by a crushing kick that shattered their Realms or slapped aside with such force that teeth and blood scattered in every direction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's winning streak was stacking up rapidly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scene left many spectators below the platform utterly speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this even possible?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is taking down these Godsons with just one blow each? He hasn't even broken a sweat! Cuthbert would've needed at least two moves, maybe more, to handle these guys."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is he actually stronger than Cuthbert?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had expected the Godsons to put up a fight, to at least test Osborne's limits and wear him down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one could force him to unleash a second attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne ever did need a second strike, it would only be against challengers from the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those were the ones he wanted to humiliate and toy with.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Osborne had racked up thirty wins with remarkable ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each challenger fell as swiftly as the last, leaving the crowd in a state of awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing tall in the center of the arena, Osborne had a calm expression as he faced challenger after challenger, dispatching them all with a single decisive move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty wins!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty-five wins!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time at all, he had systematically taken down twenty-nine challengers, hitting an impressive forty-nine consecutive victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Augustine family were left in a state of shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They watched in disbelief as Osborne effortlessly defeated one Godson after another, so astonished that they even forgot to cheer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some among them had participated in Sebastian's Honor Quest Ceremony, and even Sebastian had never made it look this easy!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fifty match. 420th in the Godson Rankings: from the Eityreia Organization, code-named Hound!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that announcement, Osborne's fiftieth challenger stepped onto the stage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A glint of cold determination flashed in Osborne's eyes, signaling that this battle would be different.</p><div class="pagination">
