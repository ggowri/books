  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow, surprised to learn there was another realm beyond this cosmos&mdash;Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, it felt irrelevant to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was far from standing at the pinnacle of this cosmos, and he hadn't even encountered the Umbra Race yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His interest in Umbra World was non-existent. Even knowing that crossing through deep space could lead to it didn't entice him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he was far more curious about the connection between deep space and his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the link between deep space and my spatial power? I rarely visit deep space; why were you so surprised?" he asked, steering the conversation back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald noticed Osborne's lack of interest in Umbra World and his keen focus on spatial power, and he couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm revealing one of the biggest secrets of this world, and you're more interested in spatial power? Well, I guess it's understandable&mdash;you're still quite weak and inexperienced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the urge to roll his eyes at that comment but held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald continued, "Since you want to know how deep space relates to spatial power, let me enlighten you. Deep space isn't just an empty void; there's something here that's like a treasure for spatial power users&mdash;Spatial Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These crystals can significantly boost your spatial elemental essence level, far outstripping the effects of blue Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're young, yet your spatial power is impressive. I figured you must have been using your spatial power to hunt for Spatial Gold Crystals to achieve that level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Spatial Gold Crystals, Osborne's eyes lit up, and his breath quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Gold Crystals? What do they look like? Are they transparent, diamond-shaped, and glowing with a faint golden hue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald looked at Osborne, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he asked, "You know about Spatial Gold Crystals? So you've been using them to boost your spatial power! It makes sense now&mdash;there's no way you could reach this level without them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond; instead, he fixed his gaze in a particular direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, amidst a powerful spatial current, he spotted a transparent diamond crystal shimmering with a soft golden light, drifting along with the chaotic flows of time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In deep space, the vibrant colors and lights created a dazzling spectacle, resembling a kind of light pollution. The subtle golden glimmer in the spatial current would have been easy to overlook if one wasn't paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the previous version of Osborne would have missed it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Creation Herald's mention of the Spatial Gold Crystal, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye and quickly located it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged through him as he exclaimed, "Spatial Gold Crystal! Creation Herald, wait right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for the Creation Herald's approval, Osborne vanished from his spot, reappearing in the midst of the turbulent spatial current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the currents were fierce&mdash;dangerous enough to pose a threat even to a typical Supernal Deity King&mdash;Osborne found it much easier to navigate through them thanks to his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he grasped the Spatial Gold Crystal in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he was back beside the Creation Herald, holding the crystal triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at this! Is this a Spatial Gold Crystal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald stood there, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as he stared at the Spatial Gold Crystal in Osborne's hand, a flicker of greed flashing in his gaze before he quickly suppressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your luck is astounding! To stumble upon a Spatial Gold Crystal like this is no small feat! Not only does it significantly enhance your spatial power, but it's also a highly valuable material. If you were to sell it, I could offer you 50 thousand Miracle Elixirs!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes nearly popped out of his head. "Fifty thousand Miracle Elixirs?! Just for this one Spatial Gold Crystal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald shrugged nonchalantly. "What's so surprising about that? Spatial Gold Crystals are products of Umbra World! They inherently possess immense research value. Plus, they're a super material for crafting divine artifacts. With a master craftsman like me around, it's only natural for the price to be a bit steep. So, what do you say? Will you sell it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of shock. "Spatial Gold Crystals are from Umbra World?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne fought against the urge to sell the Spatial Gold Crystal for Miracle Elixirs. After all, he already had plenty of those. This was the first Spatial Gold Crystal he'd ever encountered, and he wanted to test its effects first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Creation Herald, but I'm not selling this Spatial Gold Crystal. It's my first encounter, and I want to see what it can do!" he said, tucking the crystal away safely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of malice crossed the Creation Herald's eyes at Osborne's refusal, but he didn't press the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he said evenly, "You won't be disappointed with the effects of the Spatial Gold Crystal. Your eyesight seems exceptional! To spot a Spatial Gold Crystal from so far away in that chaotic temporal current is impressive. You must have trained in some kind of secret technique for your eyes. With such enhanced vision, combined with your spatial power, deep space is practically a treasure trove for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of greed and jealousy flashed in his eyes, but he kept his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should keep searching; there might be more treasures around! Besides Spatial Gold Crystals, there are plenty of other invaluable items in deep space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most of them come from Umbra World, and their effects far exceed those of similar treasures from Vitae World!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, there are other treasures from Umbra World in deep space? That's amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated his Satan's Eye, scanning the area for any hidden gems. However, after several laps of searching, he found nothing but the swirling chaos of temporal currents surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment crept onto Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald reassured him, "Don't get discouraged! The treasures from Umbra World are incredibly rare! Many powerful beings come to deep space hoping to strike it lucky, searching for centuries or even millennia, and most end up empty-handed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's focus on our task for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to deal with that tree first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're getting close to its lair!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
