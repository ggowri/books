  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face darkened, and he seemed to be struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth. "Clarissa, if you follow him, you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said firmly, "Everyone will die. I am delighted to be with Osborne and would be happy even if I die this second. Forcing me to separate from Osborne would mean decades of suffering, even if I lived that long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's body trembled. He sighed and stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Clarissa was his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her childhood, he had not fulfilled the responsibilities of a father. As the head of the Radcliffe family, he had no time to accompany or care for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Clarissa had said so much, he really couldn't force her any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll leave it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, no matter what happens in the future, remember that I will always be your father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan then stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen frowned and said coldly, "You believed announcing the break with the Radcliffe family would prevent the Augustine family from targeting us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How naive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't agree with you being with Osborne. He has offended the Augustine family. This is too terrible! Unless the Augustine family spares him, I will never allow you to be with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to speak but was stopped by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood in front of her and faced Eugen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face quickly turned cold, and he said calmly, "You're wrong about one thing. I sought your blessing in marrying Clarissa to show my respect to her and, by extension, to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But actually, do I need your consent to take Clarissa away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you stop me if I want to take her away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne's eyes were full of coldness. "Clarissa has made it very clear. Don't you understand? In that case, I don't bother to respect you anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I want to take Clarissa away. What can you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then took Clarissa's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's face darkened instantly. Clenching his fists, he appeared angry, yet upon Osborne's chilling gaze, he calmed down as if doused with cold water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne wanted to take Clarissa away by force, could he stop him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just slaughtered all the top leaders of the Paltrow family. If Osborne wanted to, with his strength, he could kill everyone in the Radcliffe family as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander and Wade were killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which one of the Radcliffe family could stop Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's pleading almost obscured their recognition of Osborne's cruelty. He could slaughter the Paltrow family for Clarissa, and the same fate might befall the Radcliffe family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen felt his back was wet, but he still said stubbornly, "I am Clarissa's grandfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "If you respect Clarissa, then you are her grandfather! If you don't and just treat her as an item that can be exchanged for benefits for the Radcliffe family, then you... don't deserve to be her grandfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nor will I treat you as her grandfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to upset Clarissa, but if you insist on forcing her, then I won't show mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes had been filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen shuddered and realized that Osborne really had murderous intentions towards him. He tried to say something more, but in the end, he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, "Alright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have grown to this point, and I can't stop you! Clarissa, you have grown up too. If you want to go with him, then go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But remember, if one day, the Radcliffe family is destroyed by the Augustine family, and thousands of people die... that's your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said so and turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stopped arguing, looking a little sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put his arm around her shoulders and said firmly, "Clarissa, don't worry. I will never let the Augustine family harm the Radcliffe family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at Osborne and nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I believe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Okay! Let's go. From now on, I won't let anyone hurt you or upset you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Dylan and Eugen, bit her lip, and said, "Father, Grandpa, I'm leaving! Take care of yourselves. Goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And please tell Aunt Donna and Barlyn that I'm fine. Osborne and I will be happy together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I will miss you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what she said, Dylan and Eugen both trembled slightly but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa turned around, held Osborne's hand tightly, and pressed her body against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright smile finally appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let's go! From now on, wherever you are is my home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also held her hand tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let's go home!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
