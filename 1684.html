  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cheerful exclamation pierced the air, and suddenly, a soft body rushed into Osborne's arms, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne embraced her, and his heart swelled with longing after such a long separation. He wished he could pull her right into his very being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia! I'm so relieved you're okay. Just glad you're safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few more figures appeared before him&mdash;Sebastian, Zoe, Bryce, Kendra, Divine Shadow, God of Star, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Osborne with incredible excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glistened with tears as he took in their faces, but then he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally noticed their levels of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in disbelief. "Have you all reached Deity Overlord status? At the peak, no less?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hardly believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above their heads, six blazing Divine Flames flickered intensely, unmistakably marking them as peak Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What on earth has happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could understand Divine Shadow's advancement to Deity Overlord. After all, she had been at that level before, only to have her strength diminished due to injuries. It made sense that she would recover quickly upon arriving in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how had Anastasia, Zoe, Sebastian, Bryce, and Kendra all reached Deity Overlord status?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had entered the Dimensional Microcosm as Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Junior Deities become peak Deity Overlords?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dying to know what had transpired during the time they were sealed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, twenty years have passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been surrounded by this incredibly rich celestial energy, which is why we've all broken through to peak Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why couldn't we get out?" Anastasia pulled back from his embrace, and her curiosity was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty years? What are you talking about? Do you mean twenty years have passed inside Dimensional Microcosm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked at him with puzzle. "Yeah, isn't it right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I've only been in Celestara for a little over three months. But inside Dimensional Microcosm, twenty years have gone by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because of deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled his time trapped in deep space, where he had trained relentlessly, desperate to escape. In that void, there had been nothing&mdash;no energy, no direction, and he couldn't even sense the passage of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how long he had been stuck there. Now, it dawned on him. He must have been trapped for twenty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down Osborne's spine at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank goodness it was only twenty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been stuck for two hundred or even two thousand years, what would have happened to Anastasia, Zoe, and Sebastian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might have aged and died in Dimensional Microcosm, never to see him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne finally opened it, he could have found nothing but their graves and corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horror of that thought gripped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness! Thank goodness it didn't come to that! They've spent twenty years in such a rich energy environment, training without interruption or danger. It makes sense they all reached peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the fact that the leap to Deity King would be far too difficult, they might have even broken through to Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, Osborne's gaze drifted to the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the members of Blood Demon standing off to the side, watching but not intruding on his reunion with his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of over four thousand members of Blood Demon had also reached peak Deity Overlord status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened further in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four thousand-plus members of Blood Demon had achieved peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it possible they surpassed me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity blocked our connection, allowing them to advance beyond my reach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over four thousand peak Deity Overlords..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened as the enormity of their power sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What unimaginable power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before entering Dimensional Microcosm, all he had hoped for was that his friends and family would be safe and healthy. That alone would have sufficed for him&mdash;he didn't mind if their strength was low. He would have found a way to help them grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they had given him the greatest surprise imaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ironically, Osborne found himself standing as the lowest in rank among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else had reached the pinnacle of Deity Overlord while he was still at the early stage of Deity Overlord himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, greeting them all as he contemplated the looming threat outside with the Deathborn army and Angelo. He knew he couldn't linger in Dimensional Microcosm much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, Anastasia, Mr. Clarkson, God of Star and Grandma Divine Shadow. Just hold tight for a moment. I need to take care of some things outside first before we can truly reunite. The situation out there is a bit complex, so you can't leave just yet. Hang in there, and I'll be back before you know it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bittersweet farewell to his loved ones, Osborne exited Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
