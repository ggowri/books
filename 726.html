  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, you go ahead. I've got a few things to take care of," Osborne said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma furrowed her brow, momentarily thinking that Osborne didn't want to be seen with her. She bit her lip but ultimately said nothing, nodding as she walked inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his attention to the rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upgrading Satan's Eye at level six was a mystery that even Godfather couldn't solve. So this time, the reward had nothing to do with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the rewards he received were nothing short of astonishing, even leaving him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reward One: Ownership of Training Base No. 1 through Training Base No. 10!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gasp at the announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Godfather had secretly established ten training bases decades ago, originally intended to combat the Evolved Humans of the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 had already been awarded to him in the past, and now Godfather had given him the remaining nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These nine training bases housed nearly five thousand instructors and trainees, all of whom were just as powerful, if not more so, than those at Training Base No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were ten Class AAA experts and over fifty Class AA fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were no slouches either, with most being at least Class B+ and quite a few at Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined strength of these ten training bases would be an immense force&mdash;almost on par with the main bloodline of the Augustine family itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, feeling exhilarated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to integrate all nine training bases' members into the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the organization would boast over five thousand members, rapidly expanding its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calming himself, he turned to the second reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, his body trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reward Two: Ownership of the Draco Group Research Institute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group's research institute included several branches, such as scientific research, medical studies, weaponry, and mineral exploration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massive research organization, arguably the most advanced in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of this institute was the very foundation of the Draco Group's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, the Draco Group might have been just another ordinary multinational corporation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Godfather had handed the entire institute over to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rewards he was receiving this time were overwhelmingly generous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Based on the pattern from previous rewards, after completing the sixth heir trial, there's no way Godfather would give me the entire institute! At most, I'd get the medical research branch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd have to complete at least the seventh or even the eighth heir trial to get my hands on the core institute!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Godfather just gave me everything! Does he sense that this mission against the Aberrants might be dangerous, and he's preparing ahead of time by passing the institute to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of concern washed over Osborne for Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew worrying wouldn't help, so he steadied himself and moved on to the next reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reward Three: Cash prize of 100 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cash rewards didn't hold much significance for him anymore; at his level, wealth had lost its allure. He had more than enough money to last a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne looked at the last reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reward Four: Mount Celestial Reach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mount Celestial Reach was the Godfather's private residence, an absolute no-go zone for the Augustine family. Even the eldest elders of the Augustine family could not set foot on Mount Celestial Reach without a direct invitation from the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the Godfather had awarded Mount Celestial Reach to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeper with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From these unusually grand rewards, he sensed the Godfather's unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather seemed worried that he might not return from his venture to the Aberrants. So, he had given Osborne all the crucial resources he could spare, possibly as a precaution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These rewards were meant to come only after Osborne completed the seventh, eighth, or even ninth trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were handed to him prematurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only explanation was the Godfather's fear of himself not making it back, prompting him to arrange things in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather..." Osborne murmured, clenching his fists, worry etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't come to harm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the Godfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the King of the Rosmandi underworld, the founder of the Draco Group, the living legend of Rosmandi!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He beat the King of the Aberrants decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll surely manage now, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, forcing himself to set aside his worries about the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off his Draco Star Wristlet and refocused. "Let me go in and find out why the Godfather summoned us here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination, Osborne stepped into the Dampston headquarters.</span></p><div class="pagination">
