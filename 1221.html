Are they really going to wait until Hearin City is decimated and half its people are dead before acting?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just any adversaries; they were three Dark Deities&mdash;one Superior Deity and two Intermediate. Any one of their attacks could level a city block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The western part of Hearin City was now a complete ruin, with civilian casualties easily exceeding a million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit!" Osborne cursed under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to bear it any longer, he was about to leap into the fray when a thunderous voice echoed through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wretched beasts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you wreak havoc in Hearin City? Think you can destroy us because we lack divine protection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're courting death! I am Joseph Deschanel, and today I shall deliver justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice, powerful as rolling thunder, reverberated across Hearin City, reaching everyone within 30 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, like a blazing star, a brilliant light shot up from the Deschanel Estate, racing toward the trio of Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single, mighty punch, Joseph unleashed a staggering wave of divine power, shattering the Dark Deities' assault and forcing them back hundreds of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone in Hearin City looked up, seeing Joseph as a savior standing resilient against the fearsome Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their darkest hour, he had appeared to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement and hope ignited in the hearts of countless onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joseph Deschanel? He's with the Deschanel family! They're finally here to save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family hasn't abandoned us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, he's powerful. He must be one of their deities! The Deschanel family's divine guardian has come to our rescue&mdash;we're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cries of gratitude and relief erupted throughout the city, with many people openly weeping and saluting Joseph in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but acknowledge the Deschanel family's shrewd timing. Had they intervened at the first sign of the Beast Tide, the citizens wouldn't have been as thankful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't idolize the Deschanel family as saviors or deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, having survived the terror and devastation&mdash;only to see the Dark Deities pushed back at the eleventh hour&mdash;their gratitude for the Deschanel family came from deep, relieved hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the people of Hearin City, the Deschanel family was indeed a beacon of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed several Deschanel affiliates mingling with the crowd, subtly encouraging the cheers and praising their family's deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the Deschanel family gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew they'd never abandon Hearin City! They must be here now because they're awakening their ancestors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those ancestors were powerful deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To revive their ancestors, the Deschanel family must have paid an enormous price! And all of it was to protect us! They're truly magnificent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is the strongest and most responsible superpower in Rosmandi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm willing to work tirelessly for the Deschanel family, they've saved us all!</span><span> </span><span>Whatever they ask of us, we'll do it without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is our savior..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ordinary people had no idea that those among them shouting in excitement were actually disguised members of the Deschanel family. Under their influence, the crowd's praise grew louder, their gratitude more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the citizens felt that not sincerely thanking the Deschanel family would somehow strip them of their humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched this scene unfold with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What a good show</span><span>," he thought to himself, hardly believing how skilled the Deschanel family was at this game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a stir, it seemed that the entire Hearin City would soon be bowing down in gratitude and admiration for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't realize was that if the Deschanel family had acted sooner, Hearin City wouldn't have suffered such devastation, and the death toll wouldn't have reached the millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this destruction was, after all, a carefully orchestrated scheme by the Deschanel family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could already envision the stories spreading throughout the land&mdash;tales of a god swooping in to rescue a city in its darkest hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the renown of the Deschanel family would skyrocket, not just in Rosmandi but beyond its borders as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne remained silent, wearing a </span><span>ironic</span><span> smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "They wish for everyone to submit to the Deschanel family, to become their slaves and cannon fodder, all while building up a savior's reputation? What a sweet fantasy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being a savior isn't so easy, though."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They better watch out for backlash!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
