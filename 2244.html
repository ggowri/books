  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In each group of fourteen, only the last person standing would advance to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to deny that this format carried a hefty dose of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone ended up in a group with the likes of Vadim, Jamar, or Bethan, his chances of progressing were virtually nil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had the potential to break into the top ten, facing off against them would likely end his hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To mitigate such misfortune, </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect had set up safeguards&mdash;last tournament's top ten participants would be seeded and wouldn't be grouped together during the draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped onto the ring, he scanned the faces of his thirteen opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his relief, Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan were nowhere to be seen, nor were any of the top ten from the last tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt little concern, but he noticed the relief washing over the others, their excitement bubbling just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their group, there weren't any big-name favorites. That meant every single person had a real shot at shining and snagging a spot in the top twenty. Just making it that far would score them some sweet rewards from their Peak Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> nail it! I'm taking the top prize in Group Five!" one contestant boasted, his eyes practically sparking with self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, right! Not on my watch! That top spot's mine for the taking!" another retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're living in a fantasy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's stop talking and start fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with competition as the thirteen participants got ready to rumble. They were all familiar with one another, and no one was about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that things were about to get heated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back at Peak Seven, Angela was eyeing the action across all ten arenas, and her worry was mounting. Her forehead creased when she caught sight of something that set off alarm bells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Zebedee </span><span>Daddario</span><span> was our best bet for the top twenty, but he's landed in the same group as Bethan! His chances are toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elders around her let out heavy sighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Zebedee really got unlucky this time. If he'd been in Group Five, he'd have had a proper shot at moving on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure. Group Five seems like the softest group! We've got Areli and Osborne in there, but Areli's definitely not strong enough to make it. And as for Osborne, he's just an inner disciple. He only signed up as an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King to fill a spot. He's just a placeholder; there's no way he'll go far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Elder let out a long sigh and shook his head. "Looks like Peak Seven's </span><span>gonna</span><span> get wiped out again. We might not have anyone in the top twenty this time again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression soured at their defeatist talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been through this twice before and was almost getting numb to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of Peak Seven not having a single representative in the top twenty for three tournaments in a row was beyond humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was zip she could do; all Angela could do was cross her fingers for a miracle, for a surprise underdog to step up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the group battles kick off!" an Elder overseeing the matches announced, and the arena came alive with action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Group Five, the fight got underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, calm and focused, when out of the blue, a figure popped up a short way off&mdash;it was Areli.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli shot Osborne a sneering </span><span>look</span><span> full of contempt. "You think you can just waltz in here as a placeholder inner disciple and diss me? I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! You'll be laid up in bed after I'm through with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Areli lunged forward and launched a full-on attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and the Elders of Peak Seven watched from their high platform, their expressions darkening as they witnessed the unfolding events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though cooperation was off-limits in the arena, it was rare for disciples from the same peak to go at each other so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Areli, the first one to take a swing at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one said a word, though. In their view, neither Areli nor Osborne stood a real chance of winning the group battle or making it to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought firmly in their heads, they turned their attention to the other matches going on in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as Areli came charging at him, Osborne stayed cool as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sect Tournament allowed the use of weapons, and Areli's attack was no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli was brandishing a divine artifact blade, and it cut through the air with a menacing edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't bat an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly pulled out his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and got ready. He didn't channel any Sacred Power or use a Divine Ascendance Technique. Instead, he just focused on conjuring an ordinary divine-power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne steadied his hand, pulled back the bowstring, and let fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine-power arrow zipped forward and clashed with Areli's blade energy in a spectacular blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Areli's attack crumbled, and the arrow just kept on coming straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli's eyes bugged out in shock when he realized his attack had been effortlessly deflected. The arrow was so fast that he didn't have a chance to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was scramble to summon his strength and try to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without tapping into his Sacred Power or weaving in any Divine Ascendance Techniques, that one shot from Osborne's </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was way too much for Areli to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow punched through Areli's defenses, sank deep into his shoulder, and sent him flying off the stage. He hit the ground below with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli was toast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole showdown had happened in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, the other fighters on the same platform were just starting to lock horns. They were all at the Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King level. With everyone's strength so evenly matched, it'd be no walk in the park to pick a winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More often than not, the judges would have to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Sirius Sect had cooked up such a brutal tournament format to speed up the selection of the top twenty and not waste any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, just seconds into the battle, someone had already been knocked out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected twist caught a lot of people's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining fighters in Group Five exchanged looks, and their expressions turned wary as they eyed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Areli might not have been the top dog, but he was no slouch either. The fact that Osborne had taken him out with a single shot from his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow sent a shiver of unease through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, couldn't have cared less. The arena rules banned </span><span>ganging up</span><span> on one fighter. Since everyone was busy with their own opponents, he couldn't make another move without risking getting disqualified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd have to sit tight until the other fighters had settled their scores before he could jump back into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This whole situation felt like a colossal waste of time to him. In all this dead time, he could've been holed up in seclusion, pushing his skills to the limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a light bulb went off in Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can't have multiple attackers go after one person, how about I take on multiple opponents at once?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he yanked back his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, two divine-power arrows popped into existence, each zeroed in on a couple of fighters still locked in a fierce scrap nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let the bowstring go, and the arrows took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from the two combatants' faces when they realized they were both in the crosshairs at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They instantly called a truce in their fight and poured all their energy into defending themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a lost cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both arrows smashed through their defenses, sending the fighters crashing off the stage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
