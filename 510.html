  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why am I the God of Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt dissatisfied. "It sounds a bit evil. I don't like it. Give me a new one! Since it's made up anyway, I want to be the God of Beauties!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! You're the God of Beauties, okay? Talking like this in front of me, you're getting bolder. Are you looking to have even more beauties?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stared coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a chill and quickly raised his hands. "No! How could I dare! Having you and Clarissa is already more than enough for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? And what about that girl from the Montague family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "You know about her too? Have you been secretly spying on </span><span>me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued to sneer. "I am the God of Night in the Court of the Sun. I know everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm done teasing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pushed Osborne away and calmly said, "Osborne, I might have to leave for a while to find someone. You'll have to take care of Zoe and Anastasia alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned upon hearing this. He was reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're leaving? Can't you stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head. "No, I have to go. Don't be sad. I'll be back! Besides, even if I stayed, you wouldn't get anything, right? You've got the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> and that girl from the Montague family with you. Isn't that enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good and wait for me to come back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And while I'm gone, be careful. An underground war is about to break out in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. It's your opportunity, but it will also be dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, take good care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa cupped Osborne's face and kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she released Osborne. "When I return, I hope you'll have truly grown up. By then, I might need your help...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised me that even if you knew it would lead to death, you'd still help me. Don't forget that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't want Isa to leave. It wasn't just because having her around made him feel incredibly secure. No matter what happened, he felt that as long as Isa was there, everything would be okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he had fallen deeply in love with Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to be separated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa's attitude was firm, and Osborne knew he couldn't stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone should be free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shouldn't live her life around him. She had her own things to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Isa, I won't forget. As long as you need my help, as long as you ask, even if I know it will kill me, I won't back down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa immediately smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned her head on Osborne's shoulder, gently stroking his strong chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought she was moved, and his heart began to race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa calmly said, "When I return, don't let me find out you've added more beauties around you. If I get angry, the consequences will be serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the God of Night, who even buried the gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa lifted her head. Her eyes were full of warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a chill run through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say anything, Isa stood up. "Alright! I should go. I won't say goodbye to Zoe. Make sure she continues her training and doesn't slack off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa walked away step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Isa's figure as she walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he didn't stop her and let her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa's figure disappeared, Osborne suddenly felt a deep sense of loss and unbearable sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw himself onto the sofa. His face was full of sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, you really can't bear to let me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa's voice rang out from behind Osborne. He jumped up in surprise and looked at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, you're not leaving?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were just joking with me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was full of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa smiled and said, "I wasn't joking. I am leaving. I felt reluctant to leave after walking out, so I returned to check on you. Seeing that you can't bear to part with me either makes me happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa walked up to Osborne and cupped his face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be good. I'll be back soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you miss me, just shout my name to the sky after dark!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll answer you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isa suddenly bit Osborne's lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit him, drawing blood instantly. Then, she kissed him passionately, even more intensely than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to hold her waist, but his arms found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Isa who had been passionately kissing him just moments ago disappeared. It was as if she had never returned and he had been dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt lost again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Isa's figure never returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waited for a long time before finally sighing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around the mansion and took Zoe and Anastasia to the Augustine Estate for care.</span></p><div class="pagination">
