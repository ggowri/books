  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon faction boasted over 48 hundred members, each one a Class AAA warrior, decked out in the finest defensive gear from the Draco Group and armed with state-of-the-art energy rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, a hundred elite Vanguard members were equipped with super energy guns, each wielding a divine artifact&mdash;some of which were spoils from Osborne's past battles, including the mighty Axe of Strength, the Rock Smasher, and several divine daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of these artifacts were drawn from the storied arsenal of Mount Celestial Reach, painstakingly collected by Sebastian over decades as Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though many were merely Ordinary divine artifacts, they were still formidable enough to elevate the Blood Demon Vanguard's power to staggering heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the realm of smaller factions, it was rare for even a Class S warrior to possess a divine artifact, yet each of the Vanguard's hundred members had one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their super energy guns, their combat prowess surged to terrifying levels, leaving everyone around them in a state of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S clones were obliterated from a distance, their forms bursting apart under the relentless fire. Many clones retaliated with frenzied attacks, but the Blood Demon members expertly deflected and absorbed the onslaught, rendering the clones' efforts futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member of the Vanguard was equipped with a Crystal of Life, allowing them to recover from injuries as long as their bodies weren't annihilated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their comrades shielding them, they could tap into the vast vitality stored within the crystals, bouncing back from the brink of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this scenario, despite being categorized as AAA, their sheer numbers transformed the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of clones was decreasing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They systematically overwhelmed the 500-plus Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time anyone realized what was happening, nearly two hundred Class S clones had already fallen to the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, Greyson, and even Gerardo stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, who was well aware of the Blood Demon's strength, was equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they were powerful, but witnessing their combat effectiveness firsthand was a whole different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson and Gerardo shouted simultaneously, but their reactions were worlds apart. Wesson's face lit up with excitement while Gerardo's expression darkened, simmering with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of Class AAA trash thinks they can ruin my plans? They'll all pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes blazed with murderous intent as he unleashed a devastating attack on the Blood Demon members. Having fused with the corpse of Goddess Medusa, he possessed a power that exceeded that of an average top-tier Class S, even granting him the ability to manipulate some divine powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strike was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Blood Demon members stood their ground, unflinching. They had trained for scenarios just like this, fully aware that an individual's strength could only go so far. They knew they couldn't withstand a single blow from Gerardo; it would obliterate them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they weren't fighting alone. They were a cohesive unit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to a thousand Blood Demon members moved in unison, channeling their defenses into a singular barrier. When Gerardo's attack hit, their faces paled momentarily, but they remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the vitality provided by their Crystals of Life, they quickly bounced back to their peak condition, ready to dive back into the fray and systematically eliminate the Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trained to perfection and working seamlessly together, they defended and attacked as one, truly becoming a single entity&mdash;a relentless killing machine harvesting enemy lives across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face darkened further as he took in the scene before him, realizing just how dire the situation had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated the emergence of the Blood Demon members nor their overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched his "Jackals"&mdash;the Class S clones&mdash;fall one by one under the relentless assault, his face twisted in a mask of fury and bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Gerardo couldn't care less about the lives of these clones, he knew he couldn't afford to let them be wiped out completely&mdash;not yet, not before he had eradicated the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members had to be eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fire of rage burning in his eyes, Gerardo realized that even his personal intervention couldn't breach the Blood Demon's collective defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do to turn the tide? Should I reveal my trump cards now?" Gerardo pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had cloned a total of two thousand Class S clones, but so far, he had lost about two hundred in this skirmish, leaving him with eighteen hundred still standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, he had only deployed eight hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant Gerardo still had a thousand Class S clones in reserve&mdash;his hidden aces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he had several Class S Human Slaves he hadn't unleashed yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were his last resort!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo felt confident that if he unleashed these hidden forces now, even the formidable Blood Demon members wouldn't stand a chance. He could swiftly wipe out the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of exposing his cards too soon gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he called out, "League of Divine Descent! Eityreia Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you waiting for? If you don't step in now, when will you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
