  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesson left, the members of the Augustine family resumed their discussions, their words filled with doubt and pessimism about Osborne's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, because of Wesson's earlier warning, they were careful not to say anything too harsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right, enough of this," Caleb interjected, frowning. "Mr. Wesson Augustine made it very clear. This is Godfather's decision, so there's no point in debating it further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, why are you all so doubtful about Osborne? If I recall correctly, a little over a month ago, none of you thought he'd even make it to the top three in the heir selection. Some of you were certain he'd come in last!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, what happened? Osborne defied all your expectations. He didn't just win; he won the heir selection with an overwhelming advantage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb spoke, the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was different! In the heir selection, Osborne's opponents were just the younger members of the Augustine family. But at the Honor Quest Ceremony, he'll be facing the world's top talents, the finest Godsons from every country!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Osborne's current abilities, it'll be difficult for him to even win a single match! Are we really going to spend a divine artifact and 500 billion dollars just to host a disgraceful ceremony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, we all know how Osborne won first place in the heir selection. He just found himself a powerful girlfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the Honor Quest Ceremony, Osborne will have to deal with all his opponents himself. His girlfriend won't be able to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, how can we trust him?" someone retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb snorted, "Whether you trust him or not, it's no longer up for debate! I chose to believe in him during the heir selection, and I choose to believe in him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe Osborne won't let his Honor Quest Ceremony turn into a disgrace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Caleb turned to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly at Caleb and then spoke. "Elders, I know you don't trust me, and there's no way for me to make you trust me, but this is Godfather's decision. Your doubts and insults won't change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead of wasting time here, why don't you all leave early? That way, I'll have more time to train and improve my abilities. That way, at the Honor Quest Ceremony in a month, I might win a few more matches and save you from too much embarrassment. Doesn't that sound better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, the crowd fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got a good attitude," Bob said with a smile. "Osborne is right. Even if you don't trust him, it won't change anything. You might as well disperse and give Osborne more time to train and improve his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandson Matthew said that during the heir selection, he lost convincingly! He said he knew all along that Osborne was someone capable of creating miracles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't believe he could perform a miracle in the heir selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, let's look forward to him creating another miracle at the Honor Quest Ceremony! Whatever happens, we can discuss it after the ceremony is over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's disperse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Bob's words, the crowd, although still looking serious, didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the people began to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Declan, Bob, Caleb, Emma, Matthew, and even Vincent remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob said, "Osborne, do you need anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the next month, just focus on improving your abilities. Whatever you need to enhance your strength, we'll do our best to get it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bowed his head respectfully. "Thank you, but I don't need anything. I've always relied on myself for my training and don't need any external aids."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was momentarily stunned by his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob smiled and patted his shoulder, "Well! Just for that, I have a little more confidence in you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, we won't disturb you any further. If you have time, you're welcome to visit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bob took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew nodded at Osborne and followed Bob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Declan offered Osborne a few words of encouragement, then left with a reluctant Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, James also encouraged Osborne before preparing to leave with Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, I'm not leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma declared, "I want to stay by Osborne's side. I can be his sparring partner and help him improve his skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she spoke, she glanced at Osborne, her cheeks flushing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself with a hint of helplessness, "Does Emma really want to stay by my side just to be my sparring partner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is she more interested in me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
