  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Bryce's breakthrough, Zoe followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Divine Body surged to Level Seven, and she immediately began her own ascent. The energy released was so immense that the entire Hope Haven trembled under its force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, deep in his training, felt the vibrations and knew he had to step into Hope Haven to keep an eye on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Zoe successfully broke through to become a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her transformation, her Divine Body evolved into a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body, radiating power and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came Kendra and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra also broke through, achieving a Level Eight Divine Body, while Mila reached the later stage of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could get her hands on enough yellow Miracle Elixirs in the future, there was a chance her Divine Body could advance further, potentially reaching the peak of Level Eight or even breaking into the legendary Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that would require a tremendous amount of the elusive yellow Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These precious elixirs were far rarer than Celestial Crystals, making any further enhancement of their Divine Bodies after reaching Deity King a monumental challenge&mdash;almost impossible, in fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation that occurred when breaking through to Deity King was often the last major evolution for a Divine Body; very few had ever achieved a fourth transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, achieving a Level Eight Divine Body was a significant feat. Across Celestara, those with a Galactic Divine Body were few and far between. Even among the former Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings, not every one of them possessed a Level Eight Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of Divine Body strength, Bryce, Kendra, Zoe, and Mila stood shoulder to shoulder with the best of them, their talents and potential on par with the legendary figures of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next to break through was Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a short while ago, she had been at the mid-stage of the Deity Overlord realm. With the help of abundant Celestial Crystals, her cultivation surged, quickly reaching the peak of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, her Divine Body also ascended to Level Seven, leading her to a natural breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her newfound strength, Hannah matched Bryce and Kendra, standing at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference lay in their elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah wielded dark and life powers, both strong enough to rival Osborne, but her level was still only at Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after Hannah's breakthrough, Diana followed suit, reaching Level Eight with her Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her elemental power was earth elemental, which was relatively common and lacked the strength of the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, her power remained the weakest among them, comparable to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, only Anastasia remained without a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Divine Body had already reached the peak of Level Seven before she could advance, making the jump to Level Eight exceptionally difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She became the last of the group to achieve a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, was also rapidly approaching the peak of the Deity Overlord realm during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he hadn't felt the spark for his own breakthrough yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Infinite Devouring Eyes continued to voraciously absorb the energy of the world around him, as if his body were an insatiable abyss or an ocean that could never be filled. The energy Osborne consumed was enough to elevate ten individuals to the Deity Overlord peak and beyond, yet Osborne still hadn't reached his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To break through to Deity King, he required energy that was dozens or even hundreds of times greater than what others needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left him feeling somewhat helpless as he watched Zoe, Bryce, and the others ascend to new heights. Though he felt a twinge of impatience, Osborne knew there was nothing to be done but to control his emotions and wait patiently for the right moment to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had Anastasia by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone broke through to the Deity King realm, they quickly realized that advancing further would require astronomical amounts of energy. Even with an abundance of Celestial Crystals at their disposal, they knew that further breakthroughs weren't something they could achieve overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to improve, the group turned their focus to mastering their elemental powers, eager to elevate their elemental levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever they had a moment to spare, they engaged in friendly sparring and competitions, honing their practical combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne occasionally joined in, despite still being in the lower ranks of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his level was lower than theirs, Osborne remained the strongest among the group. If he unleashed all his abilities, even a combined effort from the others would struggle to overcome him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he could feel the gap between him and his friends closing fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their talents began to shine brightly after their breakthroughs, and they were improving at an impressive rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the pressure, Osborne doubled down on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he hadn't yet broken through to Deity King, his abilities were skyrocketing. His "Spatial Clone" technique advanced from Level Four to Level Six, allowing him to create up to 32 clones at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his space elemental essence progressed from the early stages of Level Seven to the mid-level, and his dark elemental essence jumped from mid-Level Seven to the late stages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His "Undead Cataclysm" also saw significant improvement, rising to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne could summon an astonishing 100 thousand powerful Dark Undeads in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Dark Undead possessed strength comparable to mid- to late-stage Deity Overlords&mdash;a truly terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he trained, he could feel the power of his Satan's Eye nearing a breakthrough as well.</span></p><div class="pagination">
