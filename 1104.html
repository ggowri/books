  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's face was filled with intense concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see that, despite their strength, the Blood Demon members were no match for the 300-plus Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent. They wouldn't be able to hold on for much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once the Blood Demon members fell, there was little hope for anyone else to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were fewer than ten Class S warriors on their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they were all top-tier Class S, they wouldn't stand a chance against the overwhelming numbers of the League of Divine Descent's forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were defeated, the Augustine family itself would be next...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would mean the demise of the thirty thousand members of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson was incredibly anxious and desperately wanted to join the fight, but Osborne stopped them, leaving them with no other options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Wesson's surprise, Osborne was remarkably calm at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as the Blood Demon members repeatedly withstood the assaults from the 300-plus Class S warriors. He even wore a faint smile, seemingly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Osborne was pleased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The over four thousand four hundred Blood Demon members of Class AAA rank had held their ground against the onslaught of the 300-plus Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent for quite some time. Their formation remained relatively intact; though every member was injured, none had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were true elite warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all of them were to break through to Class S, they might even be able to face deities in battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was satisfied with the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rarely focused on the Blood Demon's training, but he knew they never slacked off. Even though their strength had reached Class AAA, qualifying them as warriors, they still trained as if they were the most basic soldiers, constantly pushing their limits. This dedication was the key to their seamless coordination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!" Osborne said to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if this continues any longer, they might start to take casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's end this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muttering to himself, Osborne quickly issued a command to the elite members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Everett was laughing maniacally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had been on the brink of death multiple times while being surrounded by the Blood Demon members. If he hadn't been a top-tier Class S warrior, he wouldn't have survived long enough for the reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was unleashing his fury on the Blood Demon members, taking out his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic Class AAA fighters! Even if you join forces, so what? You thought you could kill me? Now I'm going to slaughter you all and wipe you out completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something puzzled him. He realized that the number of Blood Demon members seemed to have dwindled by a few hundred compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he quickly dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured, "What does it matter if a few hundred are missing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hundred Class AAA fighters are nothing compared to our 300 Class S warriors. They make no difference!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go the hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett continued his frenzied attacks, venting all his pent-up rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, only Reginald stood apart, not participating in the battle. His eyes remained fixed on Osborne, a cold smirk on his lips. "Boy, your forces are about to crumble! I have to say, they performed admirably. For mere Class AAA fighters, just over four thousand of them, to hold off our 300-plus Class S warriors for this long is truly remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, Class AAA is still just Class AAA. They won't last much longer! I'm giving you a chance: surrender now, bring them to join the League of Divine Descent, and I might allow you to become one of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a sneer, "Surrender? Join the League of Divine Descent? You want us to be your dogs? Or perhaps your cannon fodder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald chuckled, "Better to be a dog or cannon fodder than to be dead, don't you think? If you refuse to surrender, you and all your people will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "I believe it's you and your people who will die today! But if you're willing to surrender, I could also consider letting you live, as slaves to the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insolent fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's expression grew colder, yet there was a hint of uncertainty in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all accounts, the League of Divine Descent clearly held the upper hand. Any observer could see that the Blood Demon members wouldn't last much longer under their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald couldn't help but think, "Why is Osborne so calm in the face of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he possibly have a hidden trick up his sleeve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned but quickly dismissed the thought, feeling assured that he had already gathered all the information about the Augustine family. With the battle at this stage, there was no way they could have any backup plans left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, his face dramatically changed as he looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, a massive surge of powerful energy was rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Class S Blood Demon members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's expression turned pale as he instantly realized the gravity of the situation, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four hundred Class S Blood Demon warriors were quickly closing in. When they saw their comrades being mercilessly attacked, each of them injured and struggling to hold on, a wave of fury washed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collective battle cry unleashed a terrifying killing intent that forced the 300-plus Class S warriors of the League of Divine Descent to pause, their faces filled with shock and caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden arrival of these 400 Blood Demon Class S fighters gave each of them a sense of impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne raised his hand with an icy wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wipe them all out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
