  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to keep trying?" Osborne was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I have tried hard enough last time. Why didn't Austin get pregnant? Is there something wrong with me? But it shouldn't be like that. Ophelia has once been pregnant with my child. Although she didn't give birth to the baby, it at least proved that there was nothing wrong with my body. Why is it so difficult for Austin to get pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, how could Osborne refuse Austin? Austin blushed. Osborne came over and held Austin's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin looked up at Osborne's face and felt the sexual desire. She hugged Osborne's neck tightly and kissed him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hugged Austin and put her on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambiguous moans echoed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until noon of the next day that Austin woke up. She lingered with Osborne for a while before packing up her things and returning to Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne started to get busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Osborne's plan, Isaac was stunned and extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He agreed to Osborne's plan without hesitation and immediately allocated funds to the Draco Group's shipyard. He required them to repair all 15 damaged cruise ships of the Augustine family in the shortest possible time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Valentin came to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac signed a cooperation agreement with Skyefall Security Services without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, the security of the Augustine family cruise ship was handed over to the more professional Skyefall Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The annual security costs were a considerable sum of money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isaac didn't care. He thought, "As long as Osborne's plan could succeed, the Augustine family's cruise business would definitely recover and even be more prosperous than before. The Augustine family will make a lot of wealth. We won't care about the security fee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne contacted Debbe of Draco Auction House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Debbe attached great importance to Osborne's cooperation proposal and immediately notified the senior management.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Serena called Osborne personally and agreed to cooperate with the Augustine family to hold an offshore auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Serena wanted to cooperate with them in the long term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing all this, Osborne finally had some free time to resume his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Alison finally designed the two huge diamonds into top-notch jewelry. One was a crown. Another was a scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their names were, respectively, Holy Crown and Mighty Scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The publicity about them began immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they appeared, they immediately attracted the attention of women all over the world. No woman could resist a diamond the size of a baby's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, this diamond had been designed as a top-notch piece of jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the Draco Auction also announced on its official website that it would cooperate with the Augustine family to hold a large-scale auction on the Augustine family's cruise ship in a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This auction would sell the Holy Crown, the Mighty Scepter, and many pieces of jewelry at various levels. The number was frightening, and a large part of them came from Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who had purchased tickets for the Augustine family cruise ship could participate in this auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the official website of the Augustine family's Cruise Company was </span><span>flooded with wealthy people from all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tickets for the cruise ship were hard to come by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Augustine family raised the price of the tickets five times, they were still sold out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation shocked everyone in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept calling the shipyards and asked them to repair all the cruise ships on time so that they could sell more tickets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who created this idea, was practicing peacefully in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy of the blood diamonds quickly dissipated from his body. While causing Osborne severe pain, it was also rapidly improving his physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, dense red light gushed out from every cell of Osborne, shrouding Osborne in bloody light and turning him into a bloody man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red light around him returned to his body through his pores. Everything returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body felt abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My body has absorbed all the energy of the four blood diamonds in the past few days. I can clearly feel that my body has become more powerful. But why haven't I reached the limit yet? Why can't I reach Class A with my physical fitness? Why can't I become a martial master?" Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that his physical fitness had definitely surpassed many </span><span>Class</span><span> A martial masters, but he still did not feel the bottleneck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. As long as my strength is still improving, that's enough." Osborne stood up and stretched. His body made a crackling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are only two days left before the sea auction. All preparations have been made. I hope there will be no accidents," Osborne murmured and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Yulissa saw Osborne coming out, she hurried to greet him, but his expression was extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked surprised and asked, "Yulissa, what's wrong? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa bit her lip and said, "Osborne, not long ago, there was news from the Paltrow family that the heir of the Paltrow family, Alexander... He succeeded in his attempt to become a Class A Power Master."</span></p><div class="pagination">
