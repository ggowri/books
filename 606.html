  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people from the Augustine family were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea what had just happened. The intense light had blinded them, leaving them unable to see anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They heard a scream, and then the fight was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the light finally dissipated, they saw Sene gravely injured and lying on the ground while Osborne remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Wasn't Sene the eleventh-ranked Godson of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>? Wasn't he supposed to be stronger than Aresta? How could he be defeated so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly had happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to the Rosenthal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Rosenthal family wore dark expressions. Faced with Osborne's challenge, they didn't immediately respond but instead looked to Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face was equally grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared coldly at Osborne and said, "You possess light elemental power? How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's words caused an uproar among the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally understood how Osborne had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of excitement or joy, their faces were filled with fear. Even Vincent and Matthew looked troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed something was wrong and raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? What's the problem with me having light elemental power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A huge problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett said coldly. He stood up, his expression stern and intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you kill someone from the League of Divine Descent and absorb his light elemental essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, turning to Godfather, Everett said icily, "Sebastian, how dare your family break the promise made at the Divine Conclave? I think your family deserves to be exterminated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, Godfather frowned slightly but didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members, however, looked pale and even fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glared at Osborne with extreme anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, they had seen Osborne as a hero and their only hope to win this battle. But now, they were glaring at him in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad. We've given the League of Divine Descent an excuse to come after us. This won't end well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is in big trouble now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, of course, heard the terrified whispers of the Augustine family members. He looked at Godfather and noticed his grave expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. He knew he was in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no idea what kind of trouble he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "What did I do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just used light elemental power to defeat an opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's the big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne said coldly, "Everett, if you have an issue, come at me! When did I kill someone from League of the Divine Descent? I've never even heard of the League of Divine Descent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sneered, "Are you still trying to deny it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you didn't kill someone from the League of Divine Descent, how do you have light elemental power? Every metahuman in the world knows that light elemental power is exclusive to the League of Divine Descent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light elemental power represents Divine Will. It's a Divine Power that only the Divine Descent can have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the Divine Conclave decades ago, the League of Divine Descent reaffirmed this and made it clear that no other force can get light elemental power by any means!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it will be taken as the blasphemy against the Divine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Godfather, Sebastian of the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, personally signed that agreement! And now, you possess light elemental power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you explain that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett turned back to Godfather and said sternly, "Sebastian, the Augustine family has violated the promise made at the Divine Conclave. You've blasphemed against the Divine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All members of the League of Divine Descent will declare war on you. We will obliterate the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Everett's declaration, Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Just because I have light elemental power, the League of Divine Descent wants to destroy the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he had caused big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members' faces also changed drastically, and they were filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected the entire League of Divine Descent to declare war on the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know what the League of Divine Descent was, but many others present knew well how powerful it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent was an alliance of Divine Families from all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, the Rosenthal family of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, the Adams family of Marcelin, or the Byrd family of Ransford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These families called themselves Divine Families, believing they were the Divine Descent, the earthly representatives of the Divine, exercising Divine authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the most powerful families in their respective countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were twenty-eight such Divine Families worldwide. Their alliance was known as the League of Divine Descent, one of the most powerful alliances in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decades ago, they convened the Divine Conclave, which was attended by representatives from all major powers in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Divine Conclave, the League of Divine Descent declared that light elemental power was a Divine Power, and only the Divine Descent could have it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No other force, no individual, could possess light elemental power through any means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they would be considered enemies of the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne had light elemental power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the members of the Augustine family, this meant Osborne must have killed someone from the League of Divine Descent and used Satan's Eye to absorb their light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a grave crime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Osborne's actions, the entire Augustine family would now face the wrath of the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family might even be destroyed because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They glared at Osborne. It looked like they even wanted to kill him and hand him over to the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
