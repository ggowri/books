  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was in a total panic. Without a second thought, she whipped out her terminal, dying to get in touch with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her face went even whiter than a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terminal couldn't make a connection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara had no clue if it was because Osborne had really kicked the bucket and his terminal was out of reach, or if the brutal environment on the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was screwing up all the comms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only cross her fingers </span><span>that </span><span>it was the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right then, Clara was up </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>creek without a paddle. She just didn't have the chops to enter the sixth layer, so there was no way she could go looking for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell, even on the fifth layer, she couldn't stick around for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she and Osborne weren't super close, they were teammates, after all. Clara couldn't help but be worried sick. She didn't even have the heart to look for tokens anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, for the love of God, be okay!" In the end, Clara could only mumble those words under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath, gathered her wits, and got back to scouring for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no use fretting. All she could do was hope and pray that Osborne was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Leroy was furrowing </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>brows, her eyes glued to the leaderboard. Osborne's score hadn't changed a bit, and her worry was mounting by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice snapped, dripping with irritation, "Leroy, what the heck are you up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been bringing in the least </span><span>amount</span><span> of tokens lately. Why are you so out of it? Can't you just focus on finding those tokens?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our team's dropped to fifteenth place! The gap between us and the top ten is getting wider. This is the time for everyone to step up their game, and here you are, just gawking at your badge. What's so interesting about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy who was speaking marched right up to Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a good-looking dude and the team leader. This team was composed of top-notch disciples from the Eight Great Academies. Each academy had sent its best student to vie for a spot in the top ten of the state </span><span>duel</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was Jared Monroe, ranked twenty-eighth on the strength leaderboard. He was the highest-ranked among the disciples from the Eight Great Academies, which was exactly why he'd been tapped as the team leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy and the other teammates weren't allowed to log the tokens they found on their own. They had to hand them over to Jared, and he'd add them to his own score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Leroy had been coming up with way fewer tokens than the rest. It was obvious her mind was somewhere else, and Jared was starting to lose his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, confronted with Jared's accusations, Leroy frowned, a flash of resentment in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jared, watch your mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on this team because the elders at my academy asked me to give you a hand, not </span><span>'cause</span><span> I signed up willingly or because you bribed me with Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you can boss me around just because you're the leader! If you're not happy with me, I can split from this team anytime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face darkened. He stared daggers at Leroy, his voice as cold as ice. "Leroy, you </span><span>wanna</span><span> quit the team? You really think we can't make it without you? That we'll be begging you to stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy let out a bitter laugh. "In that case, there's no point in talking anymore! From this second on, I'm out of your team! We're through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy spun around and walked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face twisted in a fit of rage. "Leroy, you wouldn't have the guts! You really think you can pull this off without getting in hot water with your academy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy stopped in her tracks, a look of inner turmoil flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy, if your leaving makes the Eight Great Academies fail to snag even one spot in the top ten, they'll be hopping mad. The heat's </span><span>gonna</span><span> land right on Azure Haven Academy, and on you, of all people!" Jared growled menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy bit her lip, but in the end, she just let out a scoff. "</span><span>Gonna</span><span> pin this on me just because you're useless? Do whatever the hell you want. I'm </span><span>outta</span><span> here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy spun around and walked away without so much as a backward glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared bellowed at Leroy's disappearing figure, "Son of a bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn bitch, how dare she talk to me like that! Fine, if that's the way it is, from now on, we're enemies, no more friends! You better pray we never cross paths again, or I'll make you wish you'd never done this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snarl, Jared stomped off in a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared didn't have the luxury of wasting time obsessing over Leroy. His sights were firmly set on breaking into the top ten. His team was composed of the most elite and genius disciples from the Eight Great Academies. If they couldn't even manage to secure a top-ten finish, it'd be a major embarrassment for him, and the entire Eight Great Academies would be humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, after splitting from the team, Leroy made a beeline for the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had now fully gotten the hang of the Sacred Artifact, the Inferno Drake Lance. By tapping into her own Sacred Power and with the help of the Lance, she could manage to stay on the sixth layer for a short while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, each stint up there was limited to just twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Leroy wouldn't even think about going to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a perilous place. One false move, and she might not make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here she was again, setting foot on the treacherous sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her third attempt. The first two times Leroy braved this dangerous terrain, all her thoughts were on finding Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sixth layer was a massive and unforgiving place. Each of her brief forays, lasting just a measly ten-odd minutes, ended in disappointment. It was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leroy's got grit. She was not about to throw in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy knew she owed Osborne a huge debt. During the city duel, the Inferno Drake Lance made her lose her mind, its power overwhelming her. If Osborne hadn't knocked her out in time, she would have been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she'd never have managed to fully get a handle on the Inferno Drake Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Leroy was in </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>debt up to her eyeballs. Now that Osborne might be in a real pickle on the sixth layer, she was determined to find him, dead or alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Leroy made her way back into the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a far-off nook of the sixth layer, a wild, unrestrained laugh rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, finally! I've struck gold and found a sixth-layer token!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's face was lit up like a Christmas tree with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this sixth-layer token, my score's hit 310 thousand! I've finally outdone that son of a gun, Osborne! And I'm in the top ten..." Conrad said, holding the token up close to his badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the score on his badge jumped to 310 thousand, and his ranking bumped Osborne out of the way, landing him in fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was over the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fifth place! It's just the first day of the state duel. I can't let it go to my head! But this is a great start. Most importantly, I've finally put that good-for-nothing Osborne in his place. I can finally relax a bit.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Speaking of Osborne, that loser actually had the nerve to come to the sixth layer looking for tokens. And he was somehow lucky enough to find three </span><span>right</span><span> off the bat! Too bad he was all bark and no bite. Coming to the sixth layer was like signing his own death warrant!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>By now, he's probably six feet under. His body's probably lying in some god-forsaken corner of the sixth layer, getting shredded by those brutal storms, </span><span>ain't</span><span> it?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Conrad let out a sneering smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You dared to take me on, and this is your payback! Shame I couldn't do the deed myself. You're getting off easy, dying quietly like this!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Conrad put Osborne out of his mind and got back to scouring the sixth layer for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the fifth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, Gustave claimed a fifth-layer token, and his score shot up by 10 thousand points right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally cracked the </span><span>100 thousand-point</span><span> mark!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave peeked at the leaderboard. Upon seeing that Osborne still had a score of 300 thousand yet had tumbled to the sixth spot, he couldn't help but heave a sigh. "What a shame!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
