  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exact origins of the Deathborn remain shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some said it all began a thousand years ago when Lord Malevolence invaded Celestara, ruthlessly slaughtering ninety percent of the native humans. This invasion cast a thick shroud of death scent over the land, giving rise to the Deathborn from the very essence of that decay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others told a different tale, claiming that the Deathborn emerged from the cataclysmic battle between Lord Malevolence and the seven supreme Deity Kings of the Human Community. Their clash shattered the earth, awakening a terrifying demon king from a hidden palace buried deep beneath Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn, they said, were manifestations of this demon king, feeding on the flesh and blood of the living to restore the demon king's vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should that dread figure fully awaken, it would spell utter destruction for Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even whispers that the Deathborn were the reincarnated souls of the dead, returning from the depths of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, there were countless theories, but no one had definitively unraveled the mystery of the Deathborn's origins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was known was that they suddenly appeared in Celestara hundreds of years ago, quickly spreading to every corner of the realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever one went, they were bound to encounter Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, some areas were more heavily infested than others, while others had been cleared of their presence entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that to fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity; he needed a significant amount of high-grade death scent. Hunting Deathborn in the wild would be a matter of sheer luck, and it could take a long time to gather what he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to find a place where Deathborn congregated, typically referred to as a Deathborn nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deathborn around Wild Flame City have been relentlessly hunted by the Wild Flame Army over the years. Any nests that appear are quickly cleared out. If I want to find a Deathborn nest, I'll likely have to venture further afield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those nests are dangerous; they could be crawling with Deity Overlord-level Deathborn or even Deity King-level ones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not too worried about the Deity Overlord Deathborn&mdash;I can at least make a run for it if things get dicey. But a Deity King Deathborn? Their power is terrifying, and they possess a level of intelligence far beyond that of ordinary Deathborn. Even with my spatial power, I can't be sure I'd escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most of the casualties the Wild Flame Army has suffered over the years happened while clearing Deathborn nests. Those nests are like fortresses for the Deathborn; who knows what powerful creatures hide within?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given my current strength, it's best I steer clear of them! If the Wild Flame Army decides to clear out a nest next time, I might be able to slip in unnoticed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he considered his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't go to a Deathborn nest, where else could he find a substantial number of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I'll have to stock up on Soul Resonance Fluid and then just take my chances in the wild!" he finally sighed, deciding not to dwell on it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, the night passed swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and Darren, the two vice leaders of Spark of Blaze, had distributed the top-grade Essence Crystals. Each of the two hundred fifty-five members eligible for training received ten crystals, enough to sustain their cultivation for quite some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training with top-grade Essence Crystals would accelerate their progression far beyond what they could achieve with low-grade or mid-grade crystals. They were all buzzing with excitement, eager to dive into their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Betty and her two sisters had entered a focused state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren wasn't idle either. He led over five thousand individuals who had suffered from shattered divine power essence in tidying up the estate. When Osborne appeared, each of them greeted him with respect, bowing their heads in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed a marked improvement in their spirits; the despair that once clouded their eyes had lifted, replaced by a flicker of hope. While they still had a long way to go, at least they were beginning to see a glimmer of light ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they looked at Osborne, their eyes brimmed with deep expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evidently, Darren had already told them about Osborne's claim that he could cure them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their hopeful gazes, Osborne silently vowed to himself that he would not let them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to hunt down the Deathborn and restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instructed Darren briefly before preparing to leave the manor and venture into the wilderness to hunt the Deathborn. As for the Wild Flame Army, he didn't need to rush back; he had taken a week off previously due to Walter's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had been ousted by the Swift family and no longer had to attend Walter's birthday party, there was no rush to return to the Wild Flame Army. First and foremost, he needed to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before departing the manor, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, he spotted several shifty figures lurking in the shadows not far from the manor, keeping a watchful eye on the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, recognizing these individuals as representatives of the various factions of the other Clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have to slip away quietly! If they learn I've left the manor, they're sure to launch an attack while I'm away!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
