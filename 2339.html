  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you can't escape," Agatha said with a smile. "Your Bloodwrought Bow is just an ordinary Sacred Artifact, but in your hands, it unleashes a power </span><span>even</span><span> I fear. To win against you, I won't give you the chance to use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your spatial power is strong, but my Dark Phoenix Wings are no weaker. In this confined space, they're even more useful than your spatial power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't create distance, so you have no chance to use the Bloodwrought Bow. Without the Bloodwrought Bow, you can't threaten me. So, you've already lost. Just admit defeat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes. While dodging Agatha's Sacred Power, he quickly thought of a countermeasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Agatha said, the only thing that could threaten her was the Bloodwrought Bow. Only by harnessing the power of the Sacred Artifact and combining it with the Divine Ascendance Technique could he unleash sufficient strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still had an even more powerful move yet to unleash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was to merge the Dimensional Maw Divine Ascendance Technique into the Bloodwrought Bow and then fire ten arrows at once. Osborne believed this would be enough to break through Agatha's defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Agatha was only at Ascension Ten, not yet at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t believe anyone below Empyrean Sacredness could withstand his ten-arrow barrage fused with Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, he never got the chance to use this skill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's Dark Phoenix Wings were too fast. If it were in the cosmos, Osborne could use spatial power to create distance. But in the narrow Arctic Maw Chasm, he simply couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he couldn't create distance, he couldn't use the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless, thinking, "It seems I lack a Sacred Artifact that supports close combat. The Bloodwrought Bow is powerful and suits me well, but it ultimately has its limitations. Once an opponent gets close and I can't create distance, the Bloodwrought Bow's effectiveness is even worse than the most ordinary Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he had a way to ensure defeating Agatha. Even though Agatha was the Dark Phoenix, she would be absolutely powerless and would be defeated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum is a top-tier Sacred Sanctum, far more powerful than ordinary Sacred Artifacts. Currently, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is severely damaged. The propulsion runes are 70% damaged, the defense runes are 90% damaged, and the attack runes are even 99% damaged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, using the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to deal with someone like Agatha, who hasn't reached Empyrean Sacredness, would still be incredibly easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne brings out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, the situation will instantly reverse, and Agatha will be easily defeated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was unwilling to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. It wasn&rsquo;t because he thought it was unfair, but because he didn&rsquo;t want to expose the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his battle with Agatha was fully projected. Billions of viewers across Frost Peak City were watching them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them were many warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, even top-tier Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Osborne uses the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, many people will instantly recognize it. By then, he&rsquo;ll face a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even warriors at Adriana's level wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist making a move to seize the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne cannot use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then what other options does he have?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn&rsquo;t think of anything for a moment. For the first time, he felt helpless in front of an opponent of the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only keep dodging, thinking, "This world is truly full of masters everywhere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To defeat this woman, you have only one way. That is to find her weaknesses and flaws. Purely competing in strength, you are slightly weaker than her. Even if you create distance, your chances of winning are only 50%." At this moment, Primordial's voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne became excited and murmured, "I need to find her weaknesses and flaws?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "That's right. Her Dark Phoenix Bloodline has just awakened. It's her first time using the power of the Dark Phoenix, so she can't fully control it. She has many flaws and weaknesses, but they are hidden and hard to detect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you have Satan's Eye, which can see through appearances to the essence. As long as you carefully search, you will definitely find her flaws and weaknesses. Seize her flaws, and you can defeat her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, his eyes shining brightly, and immediately pushed Satan's Eye to its limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Primordial's words make sense. Agatha, after becoming the Dark Phoenix, is stronger than me. Even if I create distance, my chances of winning are only 50%. I can only win by finding Agatha's flaws."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye gave Osborne the chance to catch Agatha's flaws.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne fully activated Satan's Eye. Everything around him slowed down, and the Sacred Power surrounding Agatha became crystal clear in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black Sacred Power looked incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha had fused three types of power. Her Sacred Power was much stronger than Horace, Broderick, and Benson. At this moment, with the help of the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, Agatha's Sacred Power reached an even higher level, almost comparable to Sacred Power fused with four types of power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Similarly, the Dark Phoenix Bloodline could also enhance her Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield, making her even more formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is why Osborne could only dodge frantically and couldn't confront Agatha head-on. If he faced her directly, he truly wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power was strong. But compared to Agatha at this moment, he was still slightly weaker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I've finally found her weakness. It's right here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly stopped dodging and lunged fiercely at the rapidly approaching Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Agatha was instantly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne not running away but punching her in the chest, she smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "You know you can't escape, so you won't run? That's good. Let's finish this fight. I won't lose to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha swung the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying power of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute clashed with Osborne's fist power, instantly shattering it. The next second, it struck Osborne's arm. But at that moment, armor formed by Sacred Power suddenly appeared around Osborne. Although it was shattered instantly, it neutralized most of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining power was no longer enough to harm Osborne's body, which had already reached the mid Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a muffled sound, Osborne withstood the power of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute. He instantly opened his fist and fiercely grabbed Agatha's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to withstand her attack. She hadn't held back her strength just now. If she had struck Horace instead, even with a Defensive Sacred Artifact, he would have been seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no Defensive Sacred Artifact, yet he blocked her attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The momentary distraction allowed Osborne to grab Agatha's shoulder. She immediately became serious, unleashing Sacred Power to force Osborne back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in that instant, Agatha suddenly felt Osborne's palm covered in black flames. She knew very well that it was the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dark Phoenix Flame was powerful, but Agatha wasn't afraid. After all, she was the Dark Phoenix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to her horror, her Sacred Power went out of control after the Dark Phoenix Flame's power surged into her body.</span></p><div class="pagination">
