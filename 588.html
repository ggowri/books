  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, Osborne spotted familiar faces, such as Lance, Owen, and Matthew, each adorned with the Heir's Emblems of the Augustine family. They were seated in the front row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to them were two young figures, a man, likely in his forties, and a woman, around twenty-four or twenty-five, who appeared younger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They also had the Heir's Emblems on their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized them as the other two prospective heirs to the Augustine family he had yet to meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Vincent and Emma, respectively, the best of masters and the number one genius of the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people seemed to be having a conversation, but unfortunately, Osborne had never learned lip reading and thus had no idea what they were talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are all prospective heirs to the Augustine family. They are attending Godfather's birthday party, seated in the most prominent spots closest to him, while I...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am locked up in a dungeon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly grew displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Matthew, feeling an urge to beat him up. Nonetheless, he acknowledged a mutual appreciation between them, as he found Matthew's tactics against his rivals particularly cunning and shrewd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was the one being targeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity! They seem to be enjoying themselves so much. It would be nice if I could hear the voices from above," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't notice a shadow deeper in the dungeon, which was the residual soul of the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Osborne's wish, he immediately took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Mr. Night's man. I still need Mr. Night to help me rebuild my divine body. His request must be met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne realized the surrounding environment had changed. The once desolate space suddenly came to life, and he could sense the power once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, faint voices reached his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He listened carefully and found that they were from the birthday party above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? Is there something wrong with the dungeon? Why did it suddenly return to normal? Can sounds pass through now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was puzzled. He checked the surroundings and discovered nothing unusual. Except for his cell, other places were still desolate and silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his eyebrows. "Could it be Isa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She might be worried that I would feel uncomfortable here," Osborne murmured and no longer pondered about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cell environment became normal, which was a good thing for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on the sounds coming from the birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the front row of the venue, the five prospective heirs to the Augustine family, Vincent, Matthew, Owen, Emma, and Lance, were in the most conspicuous positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many family members looked at them with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being competitors, the five of them seemed to get along well and were chatting with each other at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, the oldest among them, glanced at Matthew and smiled, "Matthew, I heard you used some clever tactics to lock up Osborne, another prospective heir to the Augustine family, in the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't quite understand why you do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Owen, Emma, and Lance all fixed their eyes on Matthew curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew chuckled, "I simply dislike him. He is too arrogant, so I want to teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent continued, "Based on my understanding of you, you would not do such a boring thing. Did he pose a threat to you, so you attacked him in advance? You have done such things many times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Owen and Emma glared at Matthew with some dissatisfaction because Matthew had once targeted them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as they grew more powerful, Matthew found it increasingly difficult to scheme against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he replied calmly, "A threat? Attacking him in advance? Vincent, are you crazy? You are my biggest competitor. Why didn't I try to deal with you but go after a guy from a branch bloodline instead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While his strength is notable, he's still far behind you, and even more so compared to Owen and Emma. Most importantly, he doesn't gain a foothold in the Augustine family, and the strength of the branch bloodline from Dampston is negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this situation, do you still think Osborne can pose a threat to me? Do you look down on me or yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent fell silent, staring at Matthew as if trying to read something from his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't discern anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "So that's the case. Maybe I was mistaken. I haven't met Osborne yet, but I'm curious about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen replied, "There is nothing to be curious about. Osborne's strength is merely average. Not to mention you, Vincent, even I can easily defeat him! He doesn't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Vincent grinned and finally stopped dwelling on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Matthew cast a meaningful glance at Owen with a smile, revealing deep disdain and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, who had been silent, finally said, "You all can compete for the position of heir to the Augustine family. I won't contest that. But Godfather's successor is mine and mine alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was quite confident and proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other four were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen snorted coldly, "Emma, how dare you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
