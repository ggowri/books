  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, why aren't you talking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, "Isa, stop fooling me and come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he couldn't hear himself, he believed that Isa, hidden in the shadows, could hear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is really boring. You've figured it out already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa's voice appeared in Osborne's mind, bringing him a surge of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it was you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Isa appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to push Satan's Eye to its limit just to vaguely make out Isa's figure. Once he was sure it was her, he pulled her into a tight hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, when did you get here? Making up stories to tease me again. I think you need a good scolding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne playfully slapped Isa's pert bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned red, and she couldn't help but roll her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted to say that she had no time to tease Osborne. She would still be searching for God of Time at sea if he hadn't called her name loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she decided not to reveal the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "Since Osborne is mistaken, let him be mistaken. It's not good for him to know too much right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently said, "I just missed you and wanted to see you, to see how pitiful you are, locked up in a dungeon. I couldn't help but tell you some mythical stories to entertain you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Isa cupped Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, not responding, but instead kissed Isa passionately, showing her his feelings through his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands roamed freely over Isa's shapely body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Isa pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop it, or you'll end up torturing yourself, and I won't help you with my mouth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we stop bringing that up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled lightly. "If you say so. Why are you locked up in this dungeon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took Isa's hand and sat down, sighing deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even mention it. There's a troublesome opponent named Matthew who sees me as a threat. He actually used his authority to target me and locked me up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly recounted the recent events to Isa. She leaned on his shoulder, smiling gently and listening intently to what seemed to her trivial issues, showing no impatience or interruptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne was tired of talking, she nodded. "It is easy. I believe you can handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, he became alert, feeling another psychic assault. Terrible illusions filled his mind. Isa turned into a fearsome demon who opened her huge mouth and swallowed Osborne whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the psychic assault passed, Osborne recovered, gasping heavily, feeling immensely frightened. Looking at the normal Isa beside him, he relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned. "Is there a way to block these psychic attacks? If this continues, I might go crazy. Those illusions are too terrifying. I almost thought you really turned into a demon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa seemed slightly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the illusions, I turned into a demon? That's indeed vexing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too difficult to block these attacks. I can teach you a method to enhance your soul's defenses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne perked up, eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What method?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa explained quickly with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A soul barrier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was amazed. "Is that a soul defense technique? Once mastered, it can greatly enhance the soul's defenses, blocking most psychic attacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was excited and wanted to start learning immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stopped him. "No need to rush. With your perception, you'll learn it quickly. But I don't have much time left. I'm about to leave. I came here to give you a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A gift for me? What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa waved her hand, and suddenly, a glimmer of light appeared in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt a dense light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is light elemental essence?" Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "Accidentally obtained, knowing you have Satan's Eye, which can devour elemental essence, so I saved it for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and absorb it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed, not expecting Isa to give him a light elemental essence, and he faintly sensed that this essence was different from the others he had absorbed before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was purer, more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, then I'll take it without hesitation! Because I need to become stronger quickly! You promised me that once my strength surpasses yours, I can do anything I want to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, you will use your mouth too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes. "You wish! But no problem, let's see when you surpass me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and locked onto the light elemental essence with his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he absorbed the light elemental essence, clearly feeling its power even in this dungeon that seemed devoid of any energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such powerful light elemental essence!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
