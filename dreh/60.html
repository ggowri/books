        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div><p>Natasha gulped, gazed from Norman to Charles, then back to Norman. She lowered her eyes.</p><p>Derek chuckled. “I can’t wait for you to be embarrassed out of here. You always get away with it, but not this time” He smirked at Charles waiting hysterically for Natasha to give the go-ahead.</p><p>“Uh… Mr. Norman, I’m sorry. I can’t send a customer away. It’s just a misunderstanding. You can both talk it out,” Natasha softly said.</p><p>Norman snapped. “Are you choosing him over me, this pauper with no background?!” His words were a whip.</p><p>Natasha steadied herself. “I am not choosing anyone. I just don’t want to damage my reputation. Please understand.”</p><p>Derek spat, “You are the most stupid woman I have ever seen. You are ruining your future because of a man!” His voice was venomous; his hands trembled with fury. He was angry that women kept choosing Charles over everyone and everything.</p><p>Norman’s eyes bored into Natasha. “Natasha, I liked you. But you just embarrassed me. I will make sure you regret this. I swear it.”</p><p>Natasha’s head dropped. The room fell silent, with everyone’s eyes on her.</p><p>Norman had already curled his lips into a triumphant smile, thinking she had caved. “Alright, my sweetheart—”</p><p>Charles watched, impressed. No matter what Natasha decided, she had already proven herself brave and righteous. They had only just met, and she was willing to risk her business for him. She was a good boss and a woman of integrity.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Natasha said at last, lifting her head.</p><p>“WHAT?”Norman  roared. “You little slut have embarrassed me enough!” </p><p>He smashed a glass, storming out in a huff, then stopped. His face flared as he faced Charles again. “What are you even doing here? Don’t tell me you want to buy a gem to impress Mr. Vasilios to win Mr. Moretti’s bet. You think an ordinary gem can impress him? You’re so stupid.”</p><p>Charles didn’t answer. He just folded his hands.</p><p>Derek and the others looked at one another, confused by the talk of bets.</p><p>Derek, never one to miss a chance to humiliate, chimed in, “He’s here for blind stone cutting,” he said.</p><p>Norman burst into a short, savage laugh. “Are you that much of a fool? Blind cutting? Ha! Do you even know what you’re saying?”</p><p>Charles’s face stayed calm, and he repeated, “Yeah. I’m here for stone cutting. And I’m very certain that I will get at least a blue ruby.”</p><p>The words hit the room like ice.</p><p>People gasped. After sapphires, blue rubies were among the most expensive stones.</p><p>The other customers started whispering.</p><p>“Is he crazy?” someone hissed.</p><p>“Blue ruby? Is he daydreaming?” another echoed, incredulous.</p><p>Norman leaned forward, eyes narrow with predatory amusement. “Look at you… Everyone’s even looking at you like you’re mad. You expect us to believe you will strike a blue ruby? You need a psychiatrist.”</p><p>Derek shook his head, smirk widening. “He’s never cut a stone before. He thinks it’s easy because he’s heard stories about it.”</p><p>Norman added, “You certainly stole Ms. Serena’s money, and you want to use it for this. You will ruin her. I’ll make sure she hears about it!”</p><p>Charles replied, “Whatever you want to do, go ahead. But I’m here for a flawless blue ruby, and I’m going to get it.”</p><p>Norman barked a laugh. “Are you really serious about this? You want to risk it? I swear, I can bet my entire fortune that, at most, you will get a garnet or a topaz—nothing even close to the two million you will waste buying that stone! You think this is a luck game? It needs experience. Most stones here have nothing inside!”</p><p>Norman was right about one thing—most stones contained nothing. Buying a stone just on mere gut was an eighty-percent chance to lose.</p><p>Charles stepped forward. “What about betting on it?”</p><p>Norman scoffed. “Bet on it? You must really like bets. But I can tell you, you’re losing today. If you want a bet, then fine—I can bet my entire fortune.”</p><p>Charles said, “You would better hold on to your bet.”</p><p>Norman sat down and said, “Go and bring whatever stone you want to bet on. Let me see it first, then we can decide on the bet.”</p><p>Norman was long in this game; he knew a valuable stone just by looking. He didn’t want to bet blindly, he wanted to see the stone first and judge what might be inside.</p><p>Derek started cheering. “Yeah! Yeah, Mr. Norman, I can assure you, he knows nothing. Teach him a lesson!”</p><p>Norman said, “Hell yeah, I will do that.”</p><p>Then Charles faced Natasha and told her he wanted to buy a stone. Natasha skeptically led him to where the stones were laid.</p><p>It was one section of the store. In rows and columns lay many rough stones.</p><p>“Each costs two million,” Natasha told him. Charles gulped. He didn’t have the money with him. But he went on anyway.</p><p>Natasha was worried. “You said you’ve never done blind stone cutting before. I wouldn’t advise you to do this. You can never win this, you already stepped on Norman’s wrong foot. Don’t annoy him further.”</p><p>Charles faced her. Her big eyes blinked nervously. He smiled. “Don’t worry. I will win.”</p><p>Natasha nodded. “You are stubborn and brave… I love it.”</p><p>Charles widened his eyes. “You love me? That’s the reason you decided not to throw me out?”</p><p>“I said I love your stubbornness and bravery, not you. I decided not to throw you out because I trust my gut. I have had this gift since childhood—if I follow my mind, I never regret it. My mind is telling me you are worth betting on, I just can’t put my finger on it. Hope I’m not wrong.”</p><p>Charles smiled. Maybe Natasha wasn’t wrong.  For what she did today. If he later became the Godfather, he vowed to return and thank her deeply.</p><p>“So, check which stone you want,” she told him.</p><p>Charles then activated his X-ray eyes.</p><p>[Eyes of Satan – X-ray activated]</p><p>Then, one by one, he started checking the stones.</p><p>“Granite stone… I will pass.”</p><p> “Tourmaline stone… good, but not enough.”</p><p>“Quartz… nah.”</p><p>“Ordinary stone.”</p><p>Natasha was finding it amusing, thinking he was just speaking nonsense.</p><p>Then, Charles suddenly stopped when he spotted a very rough stone. It was dusty, ugly, and dull. But with his X-ray eyes, he could see everything inside.</p><p>He mumbled to himself,</p><p> “Yellow sapphire!”</p></div>
