        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div><p>“You are unbelievable,” Charles said, voice low and calm. “I should apologize for what exactly? You fell down on your own.”</p><p>Tracy’s eyes flashed. “I didn’t fall down! You…” she hesitated, then lied, “—you pushed me!”</p><p>Lizzypie scoffed, her patience thinning. “Let’s just leave, Charles.”</p><p>They started to walk away.</p><p>But Collins wasn’t done. He stepped forward and grabbed Charles’ hand. Charles then twisted his arms free then caught Collins by his wrist. He squeezed it hard. Though it was so painful, he acted cool then threw a punch meant to look smooth and controlled. </p><p>Charles barely moved, a soft weave of his body letting Collins’ fist pass harmlessly. At the same time, he squeezed Collins’ hand harder, his fingers locking around it like steel.</p><p>Collins froze, eyes wide. “Fuck—my wrist! My wrist!” he let out the scream.</p><p>Tracy gasped, then lunged forward.  She shoved Charles away from Collins. “Stop it, Charles!”</p><p>Charles released Collins’ wrist with a flick of his fingers, as if discarding something dirty. </p><p>Collins staggered back, cradling his hand against his chest, face twisted in pain and humiliation. The color had drained from his knuckles; faint purple blooms were already forming where Charles had squeezed.</p><p>Tracy’s voice shook with disgust. “Charles, I’ve seen enough. You are past redemption. You get worse every single day. I’m done trying to pull you back from whatever this is.” </p><p>She turned to Collins, softening. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Collins tried to straighten, but the pain buckled him again. “I’m fine,” he spat, eyes locked on Charles. “This isn’t over. I’ll have you arrested for assault. You will regret putting your hands on me.”</p><p>Charles gave a slow, indifferent smile. “I’ll be expecting it”.</p><p>Collins’s face went scarlet. “You think you’re untouchable because you spread your legs for rich dumb women? Gold-digging whore.”</p><p>Tracy grabbed Collins’s good arm before he could lunge again. “Enough! We are leaving.” She shot Charles one last look, then dragged Collins away.</p><p>Collins kept cursing over his shoulder.</p><p>When they were finally gone, Lizzypie exhaled through her nose. “He’s pathetic. Why would he even interfere?”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “He’s always been stupid,” </p><p>Lizzypie checked her watch. “Come on. Sun’s dropping. Let’s get to Winchester before it starts getting late”.</p><p>With that, they walked away. </p><p>××××</p><p>In the parking lot, Tracy finally stopped and turned to Collins, her eyes scanning him for any serious injury.</p><p> “Are you okay?” she asked, concerned, flickering through her voice.</p><p>Collins flexed his hand, acting nonchalant. “It’s nothing. I could have crushed him easily… I just didn’t want to cause an unnecessary scene.”</p><p>Tracy smiled,  “That’s considerate of you… unlike that stupid Charles.”</p><p>Collins tilted his head,  “How do you even know someone like that?”</p><p>Tracy hesitated, then spoke softly. “He’s… my ex-husband.”</p><p>Collins whistled low. “Oh… wow. That’s horrible. How could he leave someone as pretty, sexy, and beautiful as you? Hope he doesn’t dupe you or steal your money before you split… I’m guessing that’s exactly what he’s trying to do with my sister.”</p><p>Tracy scoffed lightly. She wanted to keep the conversation going, to vibe with him and get closer. “Yeah… he duped me out of some money,” she lied.</p><p>Collins nodded slowly, eyes serious. “Yes, I know it. He has some sinister plans for Serena, too. And she’s so stupid not to see it coming.”</p><p>Tracy arched an eyebrow, a flicker of amusement crossing her face. “Can I ask… why did you step in back there?”</p><p>Collins stepped closer, his gaze firm. “Because it’s my duty to protect someone like you.” His hand rose, brushing a loose strand of hair from her face, lingering just a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>Tracy froze, her heartbeat quickening. This is Collins… the Moretti heir. The firstborn. He has the potential to become the next leader of the family. If I associate with him… it could elevate my status, maybe even make me wealthier. Her mind raced, weighing possibilities.</p><p>And something clicked. He’s acting suddenly, and obviously interested in her… She thought maybe he’s been helping me all this time, the secret investor behind the scenes that revived her company </p><p>‘What if it&#x27;s him… and he is doing that  to get my attention?’, she thought.</p><p>Her lips curved into a small, knowing smile. Then finally let it out “Oh… it’s you,” she said softly, eyes locking on his.</p><p>Collins smirked, he believed Tracy was talking about him being Moretti&#x27;s heir. “You finally figured it out.”</p><p>Tracy’s pulse skipped a beat, a mix of excitement and calculation surging through her. This… could be very interesting.</p><p>Tracy stepped in close and wrapped her arms around Collins, pressing her boobs to his chest.</p><p>“Thank you so much,” she whispered. “I’m very grateful for everything you’ve done.”</p><p>Collins stiffened, caught off guard. He thought she was talking about the parking-lot drama. “No no, I just did what I had to do,” he said, waving it off, trying to look composed.</p><p>But Tracy held him tighter. “I’m very grateful,” she repeated, voice softening. “I would have become poor if not for you.”</p><p>Collins blinked. “Uhn… wha—”</p><p>She didn’t let him finish.</p><p>“I’m so grateful,” she said again, the words pouring out fast,  “Thank you so much. You invested that lot in me. I swear I will pay you tenfold.”</p><p>Collins’ eyebrows pulled together. “Uhn… what—”</p><p>He didn’t get to finish the second time either.</p><p>Tracy lifted her face, grabbed the collar of his shirt, and pressed her lips to his. </p><p>Collins’ eyes shot wide. He had no idea what she was talking about, no idea why she thought he invested in anything, but the kiss was already happening, and he loved it, so he decided to just play along. </p><p>He kissed her back.</p></div>
