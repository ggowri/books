        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div><p>Collins slammed his palm on the table again and pointed at Charles. “You keep giving Serena and this trash endless chances. It shouldn’t be like this. They keep tarnishing this family’s image and all you do is pretend nothing is wrong.”</p><p>Allison stood up immediately. “Father, Collins is right. You can’t keep doing this. Every scandal, every rumor, it’s always tied to him.”</p><p>One of the uncles nodded. “Truly. The outside world is laughing at us.”</p><p>A cousin sneered. “How long are we supposed to endure this embarrassment?”</p><p>Serena stepped forward, her voice sharp. “Are you all deaf? He said he knelt to save a child’s life.”</p><p>An elder slammed his cane on the floor. “Shut your mouth Serena. You address us with respect. Because you would soon become a CEO doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be disrespectful. Do you understand?”</p><p>That was Mr. Gerald, one of Mr. Moretti’s brothers. Collins had already paid him to do everything possible to stop Serena from becoming CEO, insisting that the position should go to him instead.</p><p>Mr. Gerald was a secretly greedy man. He knew that if Serena assumed the position, it would become much harder for him to embezzle money. Collins, however, wouldn’t blink an eye at such things, so Mr. Gerald was willing to do anything to ensure Collins got the position instead of Serena.</p><p>Before Serena could respond, Mr. Moretti raised his hand again and the room fell silent. He looked tired now, not angry, just weighed down. His gaze moved between Serena and Charles.</p><p>“Is that truly what happened?” he asked slowly.</p><p>Charles met his eyes without hesitation. “Yes.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti closed his eyes briefly and sighed. “Listen carefully. I am currently running a major project in Winchester City. The Avaloz Project. A power plant project. I have already invested heavily in it. Mr. Damien has been assisting me there. If he later finds out that you are my future son-in-law, he will be furious and stop helping. I cannot afford that.”</p><p>The room stayed quiet.</p><p>“So,” Mr. Moretti continued, “all you have to do is go to him and apologize for what you did.”</p><p>Charles scoffed, the sound cutting through the silence.</p><p>Before anyone could react, Serena stepped in front of him. “Father, are you joking? He has to apologize when he is the one who was right?”</p><p>Mr. Gerald slammed his hand on the armrest. “How dare you call your father’s decision a joke.”</p><p>Serena didn’t retreat. She lifted her chin and met his glare. “If it isn’t a joke, then I don’t know what to call it. Why should he be the one to apologize when he did nothing wrong?”</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s expression hardened. The weariness vanished and anger replaced it. “Enough, Serena. I already told you. I have invested heavily in that power plant project. You know the numbers. Billions. Mr. Damien is practically the owner of Winchester City. What do you think will happen if he finds out about Charles?”</p><p>He took a breath and continued, slower but firmer. “He has to apologize. It won’t hurt him. I know he is in the right, but sometimes being right doesn’t matter. He should let it go.”</p><p>Serena scoffed. “No. That doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>She was about to continue when someone spoke up.</p><p>“How about we hear what Charles himself has to say.”</p><p>It was Tracy. She stepped forward with a wicked smirk on her face.</p><p>Collins immediately followed. “Yeah. You don’t have to be his mouthpiece. Let him talk.”</p><p>Several family members nodded in agreement.</p><p>Mr. Moretti turned back to Charles. “What are you thinking, Mr. Charles? I know you are the one on the right, but can you please do this? At least for the family. For Serena’s future.”</p><p>Charles sighed quietly.</p><p>Allison added coldly, “It doesn’t have to be this hard. You want to marry into this luxurious and respected family. Some sacrifices are expected. Kneeling and apologizing won’t kill you.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti looked at him again, almost pleading now. “Please Charles.”</p><p>Serena stared at Charles, her hands clenched, waiting for her decision.</p><p>Then Charles spoke calmly. “No. I won’t apologize for something I was right about.&quot;</p><p>Serena smiled to herself. “Yeah. That’s right.”</p><p>The entire family gasped.</p><p>Collins stood up abruptly. “So you’re saying this family isn’t worth dropping your ego and apologizing?”</p><p>Allison scoffed. “Is this really the kind of person we wanted to marry into our family? Someone who doesn’t even respect us?”</p><p>Mr. Gerald shook his head. “If this isn’t an insult, then I don’t know what is.”</p><p>Tracy’s lips curled into a smirk. </p><p>Her plan had worked perfectly. She had deliberately pushed for Charles to speak because she knew how stubborn he was. She knew he would refuse, and that refusal would ignite the room just as she wanted.</p><p>Mr. Moretti leaned forward, his voice heavy. “Charles. We are talking about billions here. My billions. All you have to do is apologize.”</p><p>Charles met his gaze calmly. “Your investment and your project have nothing to do with what that brat did to me. That video is not what it looks like, and I will prove it.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s anger finally exploded. He slammed his hand on the table. “You just said it has nothing to do with me? You are my daughter’s fiancé.”</p><p>Charles opened his mouth to speak, but Mr. Moretti cut him off.</p><p>“Then let me be clear,” he said coldly. “Either you stop being Serena’s fiancé, or you remain her fiancé and go apologize. Choose one.”</p><p>Serena stepped forward. “Father, that’s unfair—”</p><p>“Shut up,” Mr. Moretti snapped, his voice sharp with rage. “I said what I said.”</p><p>The room went dead silent.</p><p>“You have to pick one. Right now. Right here,” he continued, his gaze locked on Charles. “It’s like you don’t understand the gravity of this situation.”</p><p>Charles stepped forward.</p><p>“I’ll pick myself,” he said calmly. “And if that’s what you want, then I will break my engagement with Serena.”</p><p>The room erupted in gasps.</p><p>Even Serena froze, staring at him in disbelief.</p></div>
