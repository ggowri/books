        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div><p>Everyone dropped their jaws as they heard the announcement. </p><p>Though they had all heard the call with Mr. Vasilios, it was now certain that Charles had met him and managed to secure the deal — something many of them had failed to do. </p><p>It was truly impressive, and that was exactly why Mr. Moretti wanted him to be his son-in-law.</p><p>Collins’s jaw fell open. “Father, you’re already calling him your son-in-law? That’s crazy! Look, I think he used some deceitful trick to impress Mr. Vasilis. We can’t even be sure yet — what if Mr. Vasilios changes his mind later? Father, please, let’s be careful.”</p><p>Allison nodded in agreement. “Yes, Father, we’re rushing things here. Let’s just wait and see how it all plays out.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti, however, was firm and certain. “Deceitful or not, he managed to get the deal — even a signed document. That says a lot about him. I can see he’ll go far. So yes, he’s my son-in-law, and I’ll proudly introduce him everywhere I go. As for the wedding — it’ll be next month.”</p><p>Serena lifted her head in shock. She and Charles were only in a fake relationship, and yet her father was already pressing for marriage.</p><p>“Sir, let’s take things slowly,” she said quickly. “I don’t think he’s ready yet… are you?” She turned to Charles, forcing the answer onto him.</p><p>Charles, equally startled, chuckled awkwardly. “Yeah… yeah, you’re right. I’m not ready for that yet.”</p><p>“But you both love each other,” Mr. Moretti insisted. “Don’t worry — if it’s money you’re concerned about, I’ll give you part of my wealth. You’ll enjoy all the benefits of being my son-in-law.”</p><p>Charles stammered, “But—”</p><p>“Come and eat. Join us, please,” Mr. Moretti interrupted warmly, gesturing toward the dining table.</p><p>Charles hesitated, then accepted the invitation. </p><p>They were all served equally. He sat beside Serena, and their glances met several times throughout the meal. His presence at the table symbolized something — that he was already becoming part of the family.</p><p>Collins, meanwhile, was fuming so hard he could barely eat. The more he watched Charles at that table, the more threatened he felt. His appetite vanished — replaced by the urge to choke Charles to death.</p><p>After dinner, when everyone began wrapping up, Serena and Charles walked outside together. The moonlight washed her face in a soft glow. Charles thought to himself how any man would be lucky to have such a beautiful woman as his wife.</p><p>Serena caught him staring and smirked. “Don’t even think about it. We’re not getting married — this is fake, you know that. It’ll end soon. My father’s just too happy, that’s why he said all that. Don’t take it seriously.”</p><p>Charles swallowed and nodded. “Sure. I don’t take it seriously. Marriage? Why would I take that to heart?” He even scoffed.</p><p>“Oh, really?” Serena teased. “So you’re saying I can’t be your wife? Why? Am I not beautiful enough?”</p><p>Charles sighed. That saying — you can never understand a woman — felt painfully true at that moment. He just smiled faintly.</p><p>Then she leaned in slightly. “Tell me something — how were you able to sign that deal? It was jaw-dropping. I’d like to know more.”</p><p>Charles didn’t want to tell her he had treated Mr. Vasilis’s son; that would only complicate things. So he said simply, “I impressed him and gave him what he wanted most.”</p><p>“What’s that?” she pressed further.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Charles said dismissively.</p><p>That only made Serena more curious. She was the type who always had to get to the bottom of things. Just as she was about to ask again, Charles’s phone rang. He glanced at the screen — it was Natasha. He excused himself and stepped aside before answering.</p><p>“Hello, Natasha.”</p><p>Natasha’s trembling voice came over the line.</p><p> “Charles… please, come and help me,”  her voice was thick with tears.</p><p>Charles straightened. “Uh—what’s happening?”</p><p>“They are here,” she cried. “Thugs! They are so may and they are destroying my shop… everything! Please, Charles, come and save me!, I don’t know who to call”</p><p>His jaw tightened. “Stay where you are. Don’t move. I will be there right now.”</p><p>“Please… be fast,” she whimpered before the line went dead.</p><p>Charles turned sharply to Serena. “I have to go now.”</p><p>Serena frowned, stepping closer. “What? You are supposed to sleep here. We are family now, remember?”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “Something came up. I will take care of it and come back.”</p><p>“But—” she tried to say more, but he was already gone.</p><p>Serena stood frozen, watching him as she left.</p><p>*****</p><p>(Natasha’s shop)</p><p>The thugs were everywhere. </p><p>Smash.</p><p>Smash. </p><p>Smash.</p><p>They were destroying everything. Glass spilled across the floor.  She had called the police many numerous time, and all they told her they were on their way, but they never come.</p><p>Natasha stood at the side, small against the chaos her shoulders shaking. She made a sound—half whimper, half shout. “What the hell are you doing? You can’t just come here and be destroying things”</p><p>The leader turned. Big man. Face like a bruise. He smiled without humor. “You better shut your mouth if you don’t want us to smash you too.” His breath smelled of stale beer.</p><p>“You are beautiful,” one thug sneered, circling her. “You will be too sweet to smash also.”</p><p>Natasha’s voice cracked. “Why are you doing this? Who sent you? Is it Norman?”</p></div>
