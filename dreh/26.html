        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div>Derek was so jealous he could have devoured Charles.<br/>He was supposed to be the star of the party and wouldn’t let anyone steal his moment, not Charles. So, he had to save face at all costs.<br/>Derek sneered. “Well, well… who would have thought our man conveniently saved Serena. A real hero, huh? I’m sure a guy like you brought a truly extraordinary birthday gift. What do you say...should we take a look?”<br/>Mrs. Hailey chimed in with a mocking smile. “Exactly! Heroes like him are hard to come by these days. His gift must be something really special. Go ahead and open it for us. I’m dying to see. I mean, there’s no way it’s something cheap, right?”<br/>Derek knew Charles was broke. With that knowledge, neither he nor Mrs. Hailey believed for a second that Charles could afford anything impressive.<br/>Just as Derek reached for the gift, Charles stopped him, he wanted to collect the gift from him.<br/>Charles frowned,  “This is for Serena. You have no right to open it.”<br/>“Oh? Are you scared it’s so valuable it will blind us, or are you worried it’s so cheap you will make a fool of yourself?” Derek smirked.<br/>Charles stood his ground. “As I said, what matters is the intention, not the price.”<br/>Derek burst into laughter. “Ha! Not the price. Drop your poor-man’s quotes already and open it...let everyone see!”<br/>He then turned to Mr. Moretti. “Sir, I know people like him. He just happened to save Ms. Serena right before her birthday. Doesn’t it seem suspicious? I think he staged the whole thing just to gain her attention...and now he’s getting away with it.”<br/>Serena frowned and wanted to speak, but her father stopped her. Derek’s words had begun to seep into Mr. Moretti’s mind.<br/>Derek faced the crowd, fanning the flames. “What do you all think? Poor people will go to any lengths to climb their way up.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey quickly agreed. “Yes, Derek is right. We must investigate this properly.”<br/>One by one, guests began voicing their opinions, most of them siding with Derek.<br/>Derek’s grin widened. He leaned toward Mr. Moretti, loud enough for nearby guests to hear. “If his gift doesn’t meet your standards… if it isn’t classy or valuable enough… then by all means, have him beaten and thrown out. Let him learn his place.”<br/>A ripple of cruel laughter followed.<br/>Charles didn’t flinch. He stepped forward and announced, “What if my gift is worth more than anything on this table?”<br/>Derek scoffed. “There is nothing here you could possibly afford. If you really have something valuable, I will...” He searched for the cruelest words, then spat, “...I will bark like a dog.”<br/>Charles narrowed his eyes. “You better keep your word, Derek. Don’t make promises you can’t take back.”<br/>The crowd erupted with murmurs, eager for the drama.<br/>Derek threw his head back with a scoff. “Listen to him bluffing! Like he actually has anything worth showing. Pathetic. I hate cheap tricks, Charles. I despise men who fake their way into respect.” He jabbed a finger at him, sneering wider. “And tonight, I’ll make sure everyone sees what kind of fraud you are.”<br/>Charles stood tall, radiating confidence. Derek and Mrs. Hailey truly believed he was nothing more than a poor man who could never afford something valuable.<br/>But Charles had expected this. He knew that before capturing Serena’s heart, he had to prove himself worthy. So, earlier that morning, he borrowed one million dollars from the Tiger Tooth Syndicate...a ruthless mafia gang.<br/>The Tiger Tooth was notorious. They killed anyone who crossed them. They lent money to anyone, but at outrageous interest rates, fully expecting that they wouldn't be able to pay. When debtors failed, the gang harvested their organs and sold them for profit, which will fetch them much more. <br/>Charles knew the risk, but he believed that if this night went well, and get to engaged with Serena,  he could pay them back. With their money, he had purchased an extraordinary ring.<br/>So he said with confidence, “Okay, hope you keep your vows Derek!”.<br/>Derek barked a laugh. “I will bark like a dog and even lick your shoes!, stop wasting time and show it to us Already” He turned to the crowd, spreading his arms,  turning to the people.<br/>“Everyone, you are witnesses, right? Don’t say I bullied him...he’s the one asking for it!”<br/>The elites chuckled, their disdain shifting toward Charles and their support rallying behind Derek. Because Derek was representing them well.<br/>“Yes, we are all witnessing this. I will even record it!” someone shouted.<br/>“How could he even be here in the first place? There’s no way he has a gift that can rival ours,” another scoffed.<br/>“I hate poor people,  I can't wait to see him get humiliated!”.<br/>Derek felt triumphant, proud that the wealthy guests were on his side.<br/>Charles, however, only smiled.<br/>Derek snarled. “Bring it out already!, or are you scared?”<br/>Charles dipped his hand into his pocket and drew out a small object wrapped in rough cloth.<br/>“What...what the hell is this?!” Mrs. Hailey pointed at it, putting on a disgusting face. <br/>Even Serena felt a little ashamed.</div>
