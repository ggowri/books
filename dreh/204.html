        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div><p>Lizzypie finally explained everything, from the very beginning, and why the ritual was unavoidable.</p><p>She had been an orphan since she was sixteen, with no family and nowhere to go. That was when the Hierem clan took her in. </p><p>They gave her food, shelter, protection, and education. For the first time in her life, she felt accepted. She truly believed it was kindness.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>Years later, she discovered the truth.</p><p>The Hierem clan had recognized something special within her. She possessed a White Soul, an extremely rare type of soul power among cultivators. </p><p>Anyone born with a White Soul had an unusually high success rate in mind-journeying rituals and could safely enter realms that would destroy ordinary cultivators.</p><p>That was the real reason they took her in.</p><p>The Hole Realm harbored an ancient artifact known as the Kyoul Stone. Whoever controlled its power would become one of the most powerful cultivators in the world. But the Kyoul Stone had a cruel condition.</p><p>When the stone came into contact with a woman’s body, it did not remain solid. Instead, it dissolved and fused into her soul and flesh, becoming part of her existence. Once bonded, it could never be removed directly.</p><p>The only way for a man to absorb the Kyoul’s power was through prolonged physical intimacy with the woman who carried it. Over time, the energy would transfer from her body into his.</p><p>That was why the clan needed her.</p><p>And that was why she had been forced to make a Divine Oath.</p><p>When her White Soul fully matured, she would enter the Hole Realm, retrieve the Kyoul Stone, and bind it to herself. If she survived, she would marry Jeremy, allowing the Hierem clan to slowly transfer the Kyoul’s power into him.</p><p>Jeremy was weak.</p><p>The clan needed her strength to compensate for his weakness as he was the heir. </p><p>And once a Divine Oath was made, it could not be broken.</p><p>Charles shook his head slowly, trying to process everything she had just said, his thoughts tangled and heavy.</p><p> “But you said Godfather took you in,” he said. “You said he was the one who saved you.”</p><p>Lizzy nodded. “Yes. After I found out what they planned for me, everything changed. They stopped pretending. They started treating me badly, controlling every step I took. That’s when I ran away. That’s how I met the Godfather.”</p><p>At the mention of the name, Natasha suddenly straightened, disbelief flashing across her face. “Wait, wait,” she said quickly. “You know Godfather? The almighty Godfather?”</p><p>Charles glanced at her and said casually, “Actually, he’s my grandfather.”</p><p>“What the fuck,” Natasha blurted out before she could stop herself.</p><p>Her mind reeled like she was about to go crazy hearing about divine oaths and forbidden realms, and now, finding out that the legendary Godfather was somehow related to Charles.</p><p>Natasha wowed and  was beginning to accept the new reality. Power existed. Cultivators existed. Magic existed. She had seen it with her own eyes. And suddenly, so many things made sense, like how Charles could identify stones that contained hidden gems without hesitation. He hadn’t been guessing. He had been using power.</p><p>Charles turned back to Lizzy, anger and disbelief flooding his voice. “All this happened when you were sixteen?” he said. “How could they force a sixteen-year-old into something like that? That’s insane.”</p><p>He stepped closer. “Just refuse it. Let’s leave this place right now. That realm is deadly. You could die. And if you don’t, you are supposed to marry that son of a bitch? That’s nonsense. Let go, if they try to come after you, i will fight them off”</p><p>Lizzy’s expression softened, but her eyes were firm. “I told you about the Divine Oath,” she said quietly. “If I refuse to do it, I will  die.”</p><p>Charles froze.</p><p>She looked away for a moment, then continued, her voice calm in a way that hurt even more.</p><p> “Honestly, I don’t mind dying. But there’s still something I have to do. So I can’t risk breaking the oath.”</p><p>She met his eyes again. “I will do the mind journeying.”</p><p>This was the first time Charles was hearing about a Divine Oath, and he frowned deeply as he processed it. “It could be a bluff,” he said. “Something they made up just to keep you trapped.”</p><p>Lizzy shook her head slightly. “It could be,” she admitted. “Or it couldn’t. Like I said, I can’t risk it.”</p><p>Charles let out a slow breath, his brows drawn together as he stared at the ground, thinking hard. If Lizzy went through with this, she would survive the realm only to be bound to Jeremy forever. The thought made his chest tighten. He couldn’t tolerate it. Not for a second.</p><p>Lizzy hesitated, then added quietly, “There’s more.”</p><p>Charles looked up.</p><p>“For a woman to enter the realm safely,” she continued, “she has to be in a pure state. That means two months without sex.”</p><p>The words hung in the air.</p><p>“That’s why I have been avoiding you and rejecting you of sex,” Lizzy said softly. “It wasn’t because I didn’t want you.”</p><p>Charles scoffed, disbelief flashing across his face. “That’s insane,” he muttered. “This whole thing is insane.”</p><p>“I will be fine,” Lizzy said, trying to reassure him. “I’m strong. Nothing will happen to me.”</p><p>“But you will  marry that jerk,” Charles shot back.</p><p>He went quiet suddenly, his eyes narrowing as a thought formed. He stayed silent for a few seconds, then slowly lifted his head.</p><p>“What if,” he said carefully, “I entered the Hole Realm instead?”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Natasha and Lizzy spoke at the same time, staring at him in shock.</p><p></p></div>
