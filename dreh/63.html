        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div><p>Natasha watched as Norman and Derek walked out in the most embarrassing way, their injured bodyguards limping behind them.</p><p>She turned to Charles and smiled. “Wow, that was so satisfying. I have been waiting for the day I would finally stand up to Norman. I’m so relieved and happy I got to do it.”</p><p>Charles was still amazed by what Natasha had displayed. Anyone watching would think they had known each other for years.</p><p>“So,” he asked, “how will your business go now? Norman will probably stop dealing with you, and that might affect you everywhere. How will you handle that?” He was genuinely concerned.</p><p>But Natasha didn’t seem bothered. She smiled and waved it off. “Don’t worry. I will take care of it. Norman’s just angry right now. I know how to calm him down.”</p><p>Charles wondered what she meant by that, but didn’t press further. Instead, he asked, “So, Ms. Natasha, where am I supposed to sell this gem?”</p><p>“Here, of course,” she replied. “Or anywhere that processes and turns stones like this into jewelry. But that’s actually what I do. I can buy it from you.”</p><p>“Uh… so, can you buy half of the gem for forty million?” he asked carefully.</p><p>“Forty million?” she repeated, eyes widening.</p><p>“What? Is that too expensive?” Charles asked, startled by her reaction.</p><p>“Hell no—it’s too cheap!” Natasha exclaimed. “Good thing you asked me first. Anyone else would have ripped you off because you are clueless. This sapphire is worth at least three hundred million dollars.”</p><p>Charles’s eyes nearly popped out. That was a fortune. No wonder people spent their lives in the gem trade—a single lucky find could turn someone into a millionaire overnight.</p><p>“So… can you buy half of it for, like, a hundred million dollars?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes, of course. That&#x27;s even cheap” She took the gemstone, examining it closely. “Half of this could make at least three hundred pieces of jewelry, each worth about a million dollars.”</p><p>Charles quickly did the math in his head, that was around two hundred million in profit. This really was a serious business.</p><p>“Okay,” he said. “I will sell it to you.”</p><p>Natasha handled all the paperwork right then and transferred a total of $122 million to him, including Derek and Norman’s shares.</p><p>Charles didn’t expect her to actually send it so quickly. Everything Natasha did made him like her even more, she was honest, calm, and generous.</p><p>He transferred $32 million back to her and said he wanted to invest in her company’s stock.</p><p>Natasha blinked in surprise when she saw the transfer. “Really? You didn’t have to. This is so much,” she said softly. “I’m so grateful, Charles.” She said his name.</p><p>Charles smiled. “It’s nothing. You helped so much today. Think of it as a token of gratitude.”</p><p>Natasha looked at him for a moment, genuinely touched. “Well, with this, you’re officially my major stakeholder,” she said with a playful smile.</p><p>Charles chuckled. “Then I guess I will need your number.”</p><p>“Of course,” she said. She reached for his phone, her fingers brushing his briefly as she typed in her contact.</p><p>For a brief second, Charles’s eyes were glued to her—the way she moved with quiet confidence, her focus, and her calm.</p><p>{X-ray activated}.</p><p>He gulped as he started scanning her. Natasha was white as snow. He moved his eyes down to her chest and could see the perfect D-cup breasts. She was so damn sexy.</p><p>“What are you staring at? Is there something on my body?” Natasha said, snapping him out of his thoughts.</p><p>“Oh, no… no,” he muttered repeatedly.</p><p>“Oh… if you have anything to say, feel free to tell me,” Natasha told him.</p><p>He just gulped and nodded shyly. “No… for now.”</p><p>Then she handed the phone back. “Okay then, that’s my number.”</p><p>“Thanks,” he said quickly. They talked briefly before Charles finally left, promising to come around next time.</p><p>Charles returned to Lizzypie’s apartment, he felt like he was floating. He was the happiest man on earth today. He’d left that morning with nothing, and now he was walking back a millionaire. He could hardly believe it.</p><p>All his life, he had never believed he would own such money—or that he could ever touch that kind of money unless he inherited his godfather’s properties. Yet here he was, having earned it by himself.</p><p>He whistled as he walked down the hall, unable to contain his joy, and knocked on his hotel room door.</p><p>Lizzie opened it, blinking in surprise. “Mmm, someone’s in a good mood,” she said, folding her arms with a teasing smile. “How did it go?”</p><p>Charles grinned wide, stepped inside, and gave her the details of everything that happened. He told her a little about Natasha—how they had become close. Then he brought out the other half of the sapphire.</p><p>Lizzypie had told him how absorbing sapphire could help in upgrading his Eyes of Satan faster. So he had kept the other half for it.</p><p>Lizzypie examined and confirmed that the sapphire could help—all he had to do was sit in a very high place, free from noise, place the sapphire in front of him, and absorb its energy.</p><p>“So, like that… I&#x27;ll upgrade to the next level?” he asked excitedly.</p><p>“No, but it will make you reach the maximum level of Level 2,” she explained. “That will tell you when you are ready for the next level. The Eyes of Satan has ten levels. The sapphire will help each level reach its maximum limit but won’t unlock another level.”</p><p>Charles found it confusing, so he asked, “So, if I do this technique, it will only make Level 2 faster, not help me unlock Level 3? Then how am I supposed to reach another level?”</p><p>Lizzypie groaned. “Haven’t you figured it out already? Your power needs feminine fresh energy mixed with your sperm to unlock another level. In simple words—you will need a virgin!”</p><p>Charles had suspected this before after having sex with Lizzypie, but he never expected it to be true. His eyes popped wide. “So, for me to reach Level 10, I will have to fuck ten virgins?!”.</p><p>[Author note: Please leave your comments]</p><p></p></div>
