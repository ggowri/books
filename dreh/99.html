        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div><p>Natalie and even Steven were shocked by Charles&#x27; brazen act. He was beaten to pulp just two days ago, and here he was still acting like he could beat Mr. Jim.</p><p>“Okay than, it won&#x27;t matter if you kill yourself, I want you dead anyway”, Steven said. And with that, he nudged Mr. Jim who stood already. Ready to fight Charles.</p><p>Natalie was scared, and was still trying to stop Charles, but he was determined.</p><p>Mr. Jim said, “I will make sure you are not able to walk again by the time I&#x27;m done with you”.</p><p>“Let see who would end up cripple old mam, bring it on,”he cleanly said.</p><p>With that, they clashed.</p><p>Charles didn&#x27;t use the Soul sight in the first moves. As he had expected,  Mr. Jim was so fast that he weaved every one of his punches easily. </p><p>Sir Jim&#x27;s first punch was like a hammer. It slammed Charles’ guard and shoved him two steps back. The second came to his ribs—solid hit. The third, an uppercut that sent Charles’ head snapping up.</p><p>Charles barely caught his balance. Jim didn’t stop. He rained blows like rain. Each one heavy, precise, fast. Charles tried blocking but he was too slow. One punch broke through, hit his cheek, then a kick crushed into his stomach.</p><p>Charles gasped, bent forward. Jim grabbed his shirt, drove a knee into his chest, then flung him to the ground. Dust scattered.</p><p>Natalie screamed, “Stop! Please, stop it!”</p><p>Steven laughed out loud. “Didn’t he say he would  cripple Jim? Look at him now! Can’t even stand!”</p><p>Charles spat blood, rolling to his knees. His face was bruised, eyes blurry. But he still stood up.</p><p>Mr. Jim stepped closer. “You better check out now. Or l will make sure you crawl out of here.”</p><p>Charles wiped his mouth. “Shut up... and bring it on. ”</p><p>Steven roared, “just kill him already.”</p><p>Mr. Jim growled, rushed again. This time Charles didn’t move right away—he closed his eyes for half a second. When he opened them, his pupils glowed faintly.</p><p>[ Soul Sigh activated]</p><p>Jim’s next punch came before it even left his shoulder. Charles saw it, five seconds ahead. </p><p>Mr. Jim threw a Left jab…. Charles sidestep.</p><p>Right hook… He ducked it.</p><p>Knee strike…Charles spun away.</p><p>Charles weaved through every strike. His body moved like he’d rehearsed this fight a hundred times. Each time Jim swung, he hit nothing but air.</p><p>Steven’s eyes widened. “What the hell…”</p><p>Jim grew furious. He swung faster, harder. Charles bent low, rolled aside, came up behind him.</p><p>Then his vision deepened. </p><p>[X-ray mode activated]. He spotted the weak line in Jim’s neck, a thin joint between vertebrae.</p><p>Jim turned, threw a wild punch. Charles stepped in, low and quick, and struck once, straight into that joint.</p><p>Crack!!!</p><p>Jim froze, eyes wide. His arms dropped. He staggered and fell to one knee, unable to move.</p><p>Charles just shifted his collarbone, and he was even unable to move his head. </p><p>“What are you doing Mr. Jim stood up!” Steven hauled.</p><p>But Jim knew that If he tried to make any move, the neck would be worse, and could even kill him. He just kneeled there.</p><p>Charles stood over him, chest heaving, bruised but standing tall. He looked down, voice flat.</p><p>“Now tell me, old man… who’s the cripple?</p><p>Then, he turned to Steven, “Let me make things clear, you are not going to disturb Natalie again? Are we clear.&quot;</p><p>Steven’s face twisted. “Why should I listen to you?” he barked, forcing a laugh, but his voice shook a little.</p><p>Charles turned his neck slowly toward him. “Because I just shifted Mr. Jim’s collarbone. Right now, one more punch to that neck, and he won’t move again. Ever. You want me to do the same to you?”</p><p>Steven glanced at Jim. The almighty old man still knelt there, frozen, eyes wide, breathing through his mouth like a broken dog. The sight drained the color from Steven’s face but he still tried to stay composed. “You—you think you scare me?”</p><p>Charles moved fast. He grabbed Steven’s hand before he could blink. Pick one of his fingers and  twist it hard.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>“Yaaaa! What the fuck, my finger!!”Steven screamed, fell to one knee, clutching his hand.</p><p>“Have you heard me?” Charles said, voice low and calm.</p><p>Steven groaned, “Y-yeah! Yeah! I heard you!, I won&#x27;t disturb her again.”</p><p>Charles leaned closer. “Good of you, also, You sent her fake stones. You will transfer every coin back. Now.”</p><p>Steven’s eyes widened. “I  can&#x27;t —”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Another finger snapped clean. Steven screamed again, sweat dripping down his forehead.</p><p>“oh, no… fuck.&quot;</p><p>“Now!” Charles barked.</p><p>Steven fumbled for his phone with his good hand, his whole body shaking. “Okay, okay! I’m doing it! Please don’t break my finger anymore —”</p><p>Charles stood over him, breathing steady but sharp, watching his screen. Steven typed fast, tears mixing with his sweat.</p><p>“Show me,” Charles said.</p><p>Steven turned the phone with trembling hands. The transaction screen glowed. The money had been transferred.</p><p>Charles nodded once. “Confirmed.”</p><p>Steven exhaled hard, clutching his hand to his chest, shaking from pain.</p><p>Charles let him go, turned his back, and said quietly, “If you ever touch or call Natalie again, next time, I’ll break more than your fingers.”</p><p>Steven didn’t answer. He couldn’t.</p><p>Natalie stood frozen, eyes wide, hands over her mouth. She was astonished. </p><p>Then Mr. Jim laughed from where he was. “Wow, you are just tough like your father… I will say even more than him, because he can&#x27;t beat me. You just did.”</p><p>Charles frowned, “What did you just say? My father? You know him?”He asked simultaneously.</p><p>“Haha, I told you… I know your father! Sad he died that way, can&#x27;t believe one day, I will be conquered by his son.”He said. </p><p>Hearing this, Charles lost composure. With the way Mr. Jim talked, it&#x27;s obvious that he knew his father. And even what killed them.</p><p>He stormed at him to ask questions but before he even got closer.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Splash!!!!</p><p>Mr. Jim&#x27;s head exploded!!! Blood spattered everywhere as the tissue and every piece of his head scattered on the floor and on Charles’ face. </p><p>Natasha witnessing the horror fainted immediately.</p><p></p></div>
