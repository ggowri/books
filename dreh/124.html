        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div>The thing was… Tracy’s current benefactor was Charles himself.<br/>After catching Derek, Charles forced him to return every single dollar of the stolen 150 million.<br/> And after learning the truth  that he misunderstood everything between Tracy and Derek, that no relationship happened, that she was only arrogant, proud and too stubborn to explain anything… He felt guilty. He decided to forgive her.<br/>So he secretly invested that mysterious 100 million dollars into her bankrupt company to restore her life. Tracy had no idea.<br/>Charles stared at her now, eyes cold and sharp.<br/>“So you’re telling me…  I am the one lying”<br/>Tracy lifted her chin.<br/>“Obviously. My sister is bleeding. That is evidence.”<br/>Charles scoffed, shaking his head slowly.<br/>“You’re still the same as before… blind, arrogant, and stupid. I should have just left you to ruin.”<br/>Tracy frowned.<br/>“What? What are you talking about? You ruin me of course”. <br/>Charles wanted to spill the milk, telling her he was the secret help, but before Charles could speak, Mrs. Hailey quickly jumped in.<br/>“Ugh, Tracy, he’s just spewing nonsense. Ignore him. Call the police and arrest him for assault.”<br/>Charles stayed calm, hands in his pockets, waiting for Tracy’s judgment.<br/>This started to attract people as they watched them.<br/>Tracy took a breath, looked at Elena bleeding, looked at her embarrassed mother, then at Charles.<br/>“Well, Charles… I don’t want to escalate things,” she said stiffly.<br/>“But apologize to my mom and sister for what you did… and I will let things go.”<br/>She said it like she was being merciful.<br/>Charles stared at her, unblinking.<br/>Lizzypie’s lips curled into a deadly smile behind him.<br/>Charles said calmly, “I’m not apologizing, and the ones who should apologize are your sister and your mother.”<br/>Tracy frowned. “Charles, stop being stubborn. You are the one at fault here, don’t stretch this. Your bitch here pushed my sister and the police will act on that.”<br/>Charles’ eyes sharpened. “I already warned you never to call her a bitch again.”<br/>Tracy snapped, “Or what? Huh? Or what? She is a bitch. She’s the one who transformed you into this. You weren’t like this before. Look at you now.”<br/>Charles stepped closer. “Call her bitch one more time and you will join your bleeding sister.”<br/>Tracy shrieked, “Are you threatening me right now?” She added,  “Let me be frank with you. I know you are angry your plan to ruin me didn’t work. I bounced back and I’m doing well, thanks to someone’s mercy,  my benefactor. And yes, I know you hate that.”<br/>She  continued. “So let me tell you something. The past is the past. If you want to come back to me now and try to become husband and wife again, forget it. There is nothing between us. Just leave this bi— leave this lady. Stop being her toy and come back to me. I will accept you.”<br/>Elena panicked and shook her head. “No, sister, don’t do that, don't accept this poor pauper man in your life again to destroy you”<br/>Charles scoffed. “Why do you think I want you back in my life?”<br/>Tracy said, “Look at you. Since you left me you’re just jumping from one woman to another trying to survive. You’re not doing well, Charles. You’re still poor. Even the money you got from that stone thing didn’t show in your lifestyle. I’m sure this b—this lady took everything from you. She’s using you. Come back to me and we’ll build this new wealth together.”<br/>Charles gave a slow smile. “What makes you think I’m poor?”<br/>Tracy folded her arms. “Isn’t it obvious? Look at your dressing. No rich man dresses like that. Be honest with yourself.”<br/>Charles didn’t even bother explaining that the money she was bragging about now,  the investment that saved her was all thanks to him. He was the benefactor. But he didn't even stress to explain. <br/>He just said, “I’m fine where I’m at. Thank you. And I’m not apologizing. You can call the police if you want.”<br/>Then he took Lizzypie’s hand and started walking away.<br/>Tracy shouted behind him, “You will regret this! Stop acting tough!”<br/>Charles didn’t turn back.<br/>Tracy shifted back to her sister immediately and held her shoulders. “Elena… are you okay?”<br/>Elena shrieked. “Do I look okay? Look at my arm! I need to go to the hospital! Tracy, call the police on him, he must be arrested!”<br/>Mrs. Hailey added sharply, “Yes! Arrest him! That monster pushed my daughter, he must pay for this.”<br/>Tracy nodded, still breathing fast. “I will do something about it… but mom,” she narrowed her eyes with disgust, “please just show your face less around the city. I don’t like it.”<br/>“What… what…?” Mrs. Hailey stuttered, shocked at her daughter’s words.<br/>Tracy didn’t even look at her. She just grabbed Elena and said, “Let’s go to the hospital.”<br/>They both walked out, Elena limping and crying while Mrs. Hailey followed behind in silence, too ashamed to say anything.<br/>---<br/>Meanwhile inside Charles’s car, Lizzypie was grunting angrily.<br/>“Just look at her,” she hissed. “I have always told you she didn’t deserve saving. She stood there flaunting her new wealth when you are the one that gave her everything.”<br/>Charles stared ahead through the windshield, his face calm,  “And I can take it back whenever I want,” he said quietly.<br/>Lizzypie smirked. “Exactly. You better do that”.</div>
