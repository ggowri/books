        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div><p>Charles hauled Serena into his arms instantly, screaming her name as she collapsed on the dusty floor.</p><p>“Serena!! Serena!!”</p><p>The bullet had hit her directly in the chest.</p><p>Blood poured out fast, soaking her shirt, spilling over Charles’ hands. She coughed violently, puffing out blood with each breath.</p><p>Charles shook her lightly, panicking.</p><p>“No, no… stay with me. Serena, look at me, you are going to be fine. You hear me?”</p><p>But Serena kept choking on blood, her body trembling weakly.</p><p>Behind them, the leader scoffed.</p><p>“Well. The bitch we wanted dead is already dead.”</p><p>Charles slowly lifted his head, his entire face stained with Serena’s blood, his eyes burning with rage.</p><p>He glared at the leader with pure hatred.</p><p>The leader smirked wider.</p><p>“Haha… what are you going to do? Nothing. You are finished. And now I will kill you too. You should have accepted my offer when I was being nice.”</p><p>He raised his hand and gave a sharp signal toward the corner.</p><p>“Sniper! Finish him!”</p><p>…</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>The leader frowned.He signaled again.Still nothing.</p><p>“Huh? Where the hell is that bastard?” he barked.</p><p>THUD!!</p><p>A body dropped from above and slammed onto the center of the room.</p><p>Everyone flinched backward.</p><p>It was the sniper.</p><p>Dead and his neck snapped.</p><p>Before anyone could react, someone moved at the entrance. Just then, a figure walked in calmly.</p><p>“Who the fuck are you?” one thug shouted.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Suddenly, dozens of figures stepped in behind him.</p><p>The entire room froze.</p><p>The thugs turned around and saw that the entire building&#x27;s front, back, side, staircases were now filled with heavily armed mercenaries. Each thug had at least two rifles pointed at his head.</p><p>They were wearing dark tactical gear, heavy boots, bulletproof plating, advanced weapons not normal guards.</p><p>More than a hundred of them.</p><p>The thugs were overwhelmed instantly.</p><p>The sound of multiple safeties clicking echoed loudly.</p><p>TK TK TK TK TK TK</p><p>The sound of a helicopter spinning its blades thundered from outside the compound.</p><p>The pressure in the room shifted, everyone now understood this wasn’t just an ambush.</p><p>This was a full-scale professional operation.</p><p>The first figure walked further inside.</p><p>Under the dim light, his face became clear.</p><p>It was Rain.</p><p>The leader’s smirk vanished instantly.</p><p>His face drained white.</p><p>Everyone recognized him. Rain, the right hand of Godfather. Because the Godfather never showed his face, Rain was the one everyone saw, the one they feared.</p><p>And in this city, there was not a single soul in the underworld who didn’t know his name.</p><p>The leader stammered, trembling:</p><p>“M–Mr… Mr. Rain… what—!?”</p><p>His men murmured in pure panic.</p><p>“Godfather’s men…? Here?”</p><p>“Why is he here—?”</p><p>“We are doomed… we are dead…”</p><p>Rain’s gaze swept across the room  before landing on Charles, who was kneeling on the dusty floor, holding Serena tightly in his arms as blood soaked through his clothes.</p><p>The leader instantly panicked.</p><p>He spun toward his men and shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“DROP YOUR WEAPONS!! NOW!! YOU FOOLS!! DROP EVERYTHING!!”</p><p>Every thug obeyed instantly, guns clattering on the ground like rain.</p><p>Rain didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.</p><p>The fear in the room was enough that the thugs were commanding themselves.</p><p>The leader forced an awkward smile as he approached Rain with trembling legs.</p><p>“Sir… I–I’m Macho. Please, how can I be of help—”</p><p>BOOM!!</p><p>A gunshot exploded in the quiet room.</p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p>A body hit the floor.</p><p>Rain had shot him clean in the forehead without even blinking.</p><p>Gasps filled the entire room, terror choking the air.</p><p>Just like that. With no warning.</p><p>All the other thugs froze, eyes widening in absolute horror. Including the other two.</p><p>A heartbeat later, they collapsed, every single one dropping to their knees at once, slamming their foreheads down so hard their skulls echoed.</p><p>&quot;Mercy! Please, spare us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forgive our ignorance! However we have offended the Godfather, we will repay a thousand times over! Just let us live!&quot;</p><p>They were shaking like leaves in a storm.</p><p>Rain didn’t even spare them a glance.</p><p>He walked straight toward Charles.</p><p>“Young Master,” he said, giving a slight, respectful bow. “Are you injured?”</p><p>The thugs&#x27; faces went sheet-white. Their jaws hung slack.</p><p>One of the kneeling men suddenly vomited onto the floor.</p><p>&quot;Young Master... Godfather...&quot; a thug stammered, the words dawning on him with horrific clarity. &quot;Oh god... we didn&#x27;t know! We&#x27;re blind! We&#x27;re fools!&quot;</p><p>Charles looked up,  he didn’t look at the thugs. His hands shaking as he held Serena’s unconscious body against his chest.</p><p>“Please… save her,” Charles breathed heavily. “Take her to the hospital.”</p><p>Rain knelt and quickly examined the wound.</p><p>“It’s a gunshot,” he said calmly. “Nothing serious. We have a potion that can close the wound and heal her fast.”</p><p>Charles blinked in shock. His grandfather had magic potion medicine too?</p><p>Rain signaled to two mercenaries, who immediately rushed forward.</p><p>“Carry her to the medical van. Don’t heal it fully, just reduce the bleeding and pain. Leave the wound visible, so she does not suspect supernatural interference.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” they bowed and lifted Serena carefully.</p><p>As they rushed her out, Charles stood up </p><p>When Serena said they were coming here, Charles already sensed something was off.</p><p>He didn’t trust the situation.</p><p>So he informed Lizzypie earlier, before they even entered the hideout that he might need the  Godfather help requests.</p><p>When they surrendered, guns pointed at them. Charles used his phone’s quick dial to send the emergency signal to Lizzypie. That was the reason Rain arrived in time.</p><p>Charles wiped Serena’s blood off his hands slowly, then lifted his head and stared at the trembling thugs still kneeling.</p><p>His voice was calm, deadly calm.</p><p>“You… two. Come forward.”</p><p>Two of the thugs that attacked him immediately scrambled up, practically tripping over themselves as they rushed forward and knelt right in front of him, shaking.</p><p>Charles pointed at the first one.</p><p>“Your name.”</p><p>The thug gulped hard.</p><p>“L–Liam, sir… but everyone calls me Reaper.”</p><p>Charles turned to the second.</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Zander… but I’m called Hazard.”</p><p>Charles’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“I’m going to ask only once…you won’t even see the next second.”</p><p>Both thugs nodded violently.</p><p>“Yes—yes sir! We will talk!”</p><p>“We will tell you everything!”</p><p>“I’m listening,” Charles said coldly.</p><p>Reaper swallowed and then shouted in fear,</p><p>“It was Mr. Damien!!”</p><p>Zander backed him up instantly, voice cracking,</p><p>“Yes!! It’s fucking Mr. Damien!! He paid us to kill her!!”</p><p>Charles’s face dropped into a deep frown.</p><p>Mr. Damien. He knew that name all too well.</p><p>Serena’s uncle.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s blood brother.</p></div>
