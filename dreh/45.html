        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div><p>Tracy pushed his hand away, wondering how the Tiger Fangs family could be so disgusting. First his son, and now the father himself.</p><p>Tiger was probably in his mid-60s, yet he wanted to sleep with someone who could be his granddaughter.</p><p>“What do you think you are doing? That is inappropriate,” Tracy glared at him.</p><p>“Uhn… you understand me, right? Apologize with your body, and I will let everything go,” he said.</p><p>“How could you think of something so disgusting?”</p><p>“Disgusting? Then I will make you witness the most disgusting thing after I kill your lover and whoever is close to you,” he threatened her.</p><p>Majik licked his lips eagerly. &quot;Father, what about me?&quot;</p><p>Tracy gazed at the both of them.</p><p> “Not over my dead body. Am I really going to let this old, disgusting man and his foolish son touch me?”</p><p>She stood up from her knees and said, “This is crazy, both of you. I’m a human, not a doll you can just fuck!”</p><p>Just then, Tiger’s phone rang; it was his personal bodyguard. “Oh,” Tiger said and put it on speaker.</p><p>“Boss, we are all ready… waiting for your order to go and kill that motherfucker.”</p><p>To let Tracy know what he was planning, he asked, “How many boys did you mobilize?”</p><p>“Almost all of the boys, thousands of them.”</p><p>Tracy raised her eyebrows at this. Thousands of thugs for Charles. He is going to die undoubtedly.</p><p>“What about the mercenaries?” Tiger asked further.</p><p>“Yes, everyone has a gun. No one is going to escape this. We are just waiting for your go-ahead order.”</p><p>Tiger gestured at Tracy and put the call on hold.</p><p>“Your little hero is about to be crushed into pulp. No one’s taking you away—unless you let me fuck you nicely and obediently.”</p><p>“No… please…” Tracy tried to back away in terror, but Tiger seized her wrist.</p><p>“You have no choice,” he sneered, a vile grin spreading across his face. “Once I’ve killed him, I’ll bring his head back so you can watch it while I take you.”</p><p>He ended the call.</p><p>Majik chimed in again, “Father… will you let me also fuck her after you are done?”</p><p>Tiger smiled, “Yes, son. We will both have her. But everyone can wait outside first until I am finished.”</p><p>The bodyguards then all left, leaving Tracy and Tiger in the room.</p><p>Tracy shifted. “I think you should freshen up first. Please don’t rush me.”</p><p>Tiger groaned. “Okay, I will do that… but don’t try to act funny. You know what will happen,” he said.</p><p>Tracy nodded in understanding while Tiger left to freshen up. </p><p>She started to panic. It was a big mistake to come here, Tiger wouldn’t just let her go.</p><p>So she picked up her phone and texted Charles.</p><p>&lt;I’m about to get raped!&gt;</p><p>After some minutes, Tiger was finished and came back with only his towel, moving closer to Tracy.</p><p>“Why are you still with your clothes? Take it off now!” he tried to touch her. But Tracy flinched. This made him angry.</p><p>“Bitch!” He yelled, then took the rough way. He pushed her on the sofa, and Tracy fought to free herself. But Tiger pinned her down.</p><p>He growled, “Show me your big breast! You little chippie!” He was about to tear off her clothes—</p><p>“Gbam!” The door fell off, and there he was—Charles, with his leg still in the kicking motion.</p><p>“Charles,” Tracy murmured.</p><p>“How could you touch her? You are an impeccable, imbecile man!” Charles yelled.</p><p>“Who are you… guards!!!” Tiger roared. Charles angrily stormed at him and gave him a punch, breaking his nose instantly. It was so fast that Tiger couldn’t see it coming.</p><p>Within minutes, many thugs arrived, blocking every way. Some of them were already beaten up by Charles before coming in.</p><p>“Ahhh, my nose! You are dead today. Consider yourself gone!” he screamed in pain, holding his nose.</p><p>Charles grabbed Tracy’s hand. “Let’s go. How could you do this!”</p><p>As they were about to leave, the Tiger Fangs thugs were already in, surrounding them—all with guns.</p><p>The guards pointed guns at Tracy and Charles, who hid behind Mlynar.</p><p>“Who are you to barge in here… Are you the one that beat up my son!” Tiger cried out, still holding his nose.</p><p>Charles chose not to say anything; he glared at them. LizzyPie had told him how dangerous the Tiger Fangs were. He just wanted to get out of here.</p><p>“I think I’m right. I heard you beat up tens of my gangs with only bare hands. Let’s see if that’s true,” Mr. Tiger smirked, then brought out and pointed a gun at Cynthia.</p><p>“If you don’t want her dead, surrender and kneel down,” Mr. Tiger sneered.</p><p>Charles scanned them, considering knocking them out with his power. He could beat some people and make his way out. But he hesitated, not wanting to put Tracy’s life in danger.</p><p>He chose to kneel down, looking for an opportunity for a great escape.</p><p>Tiger himself dragged Tracy away from him by her hair. He yanked off Tracy&#x27;s skirt, revealing her plump thighs. All the men looked at her with greedy eyes, and some even began to drool.</p><p>“Leave me, get your stinky hand away from me!”she roared.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, honey. I&#x27;ll satisfy you soon.&quot; Tiger grinned and then turned to Charles. &quot;And you, just watch your bitch lick my cock.&quot;</p><p></p></div>
