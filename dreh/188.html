        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing Jude remain silent, Sapphire&rsquo;s gaze sharpened slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you,&rdquo; she said again, calm but firmer this time. &ldquo;What is going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>Jude jolted, then immediately pointed at Charles and Serena.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these two,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;They are disturbing the peace of everyone here. Causing trouble. They came with some proposal I already told them we weren&rsquo;t interested in, but they refused to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire tilted her head slightly. &ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins stepped forward at once, eager. &ldquo;If I may,&rdquo; he said smoothly. &ldquo;They almost broke Ms. Linda&rsquo;s leg just now. That&rsquo;s the reason Mr. Jude wanted to teach them a lesson.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire&rsquo;s eyes shifted to Serena and Charles. Her gaze was steady, unreadable.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that really what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s heart pounded, but she forced herself to speak. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even listen to our proposal before rejecting us and ordering us to leave. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop lying,&rdquo; Jude snapped, cutting her off. &ldquo;You are just disappointed I didn&rsquo;t accept your proposal. You refused to leave after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire turned slowly toward the reception desk. &ldquo;Quincy,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;Is that what really happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Before Quincy could open her mouth, Jude spoke again, fast and sharp. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t here at the beginning of everything. I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. These two people are crazy. We should call the police on them immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins nodded eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best option,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;This man here is a troublemaker.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire&rsquo;s eyes drifted back to Charles.</p><p>For a split second, she almost smiled at him.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles met her gaze and gave a subtle nod to pretend he didn't know him.&nbsp;</p><p>She masked it instantly.</p><p>Then Serena spoke again, her voice steady now, edged with quiet anger.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So you are saying the problem is just the two of us, right.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude nodded quickly. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, exactly.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins grinned, victory already written across his face. &ldquo;Also, he didn't deserve to be here. He is mentally deranged saying he knows you!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>Sapphire inhaled slowly, then exhaled as she stared at Charles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You deserve a slap for what you did,&rdquo; she said coolly.</p><p>Linda&rsquo;s face lit up with satisfaction as she chimed in, &ldquo;Yes, madam. Slap some sense into him right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire raised her hand.</p><p>The sound echoed sharply through the lobby.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>The slap rang out across the company floor, silencing everything.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Jaws dropped across the lobby, not because of the slap itself, but because of who received it.&nbsp;</p><p>For a split second, most of them had thought Sapphire was manipulated enough to strike Charles.</p><p>Instead, Jude was the one holding his face. She had turned swiftly and delivered the slap to him.&nbsp;</p><p>His hand trembled as it pressed against his cheek, eyes wide in disbelief. &ldquo;Ma&hellip; why&hellip;&rdquo; he stammered, voice breaking.</p><p>Sapphire&rsquo;s expression was cold now.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Say one more lie,&rdquo; she said evenly, &ldquo;and I will slap you again.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude went silent.</p><p>She took a step forward, her presence crushing.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you really think I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening here? I saw everything&rdquo;</p><p>Collins, still stunned, blurted out to defend jude,&nbsp; &ldquo;Ma, this lowlife, this ragman, he is the one who started everything. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Sapphire cut in sharply. &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes flicked to him, sharp and unforgiving. &ldquo;You should not even attempt to lie&rdquo;</p><p>She straightened and continued calmly, &ldquo;From the beginning, I saw everything. I also sent one of my guards here earlier to secretly record what was going on. I received everything in real time.&rdquo;</p><p>She reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone.</p><p>The screen lit up.</p><p>She turned it around.</p><p>The video played clearly, capturing Jude&rsquo;s threats, Linda&rsquo;s manipulation, Collins&rsquo; smug provocations, the guards being ordered to beat Charles and Serena, every word sharp and undeniable.</p><p>Linda&rsquo;s mouth opened, then closed. Collins&rsquo; grin vanished completely. Tracy silently looked away.</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s hand dropped slowly from his cheek. His lips moved, but no sound came out.</p><p>Sapphire lowered the phone and looked straight at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you wanted to please your stupid fianc&eacute;e,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;you went against company protocol, abused your authority, threatened violence inside my company, and nearly destroyed my reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>She took one final step closer.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve this position,&rdquo; she said flatly. &ldquo;You ought to be sacked.&rdquo;</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s knees hit the marble hard.</p><p>&ldquo;What&mdash;no&mdash;please,&rdquo; he blurted out, panic ripping through his voice as he grabbed Sapphire's trouser leg.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Boss, don&rsquo;t do this to me. Please. I was unemployed for four years before I finally got this job. This is the best-paying company in the city. I can&rsquo;t lose this. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire looked down at him, her expression unmoved.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you should have thought about that,&rdquo; she added brutally,&nbsp; &ldquo;before listening to your stupid fianc&eacute;e and taking her side.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hang it right there,&rdquo; she shouted, stepping forward. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare call me stupid. Just because you are some CEO doesn&rsquo;t mean you can talk to me anyhow&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t finish.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>The sound cracked through the lobby as Jude slapped her hard across the face.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut the fuck up,&rdquo; he yelled, eyes wild. &ldquo;Do you want to completely ruin my life?&rdquo;</p><p>Linda staggered back, stunned, her hand flying to her cheek. &ldquo;Baby&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare baby me,&rdquo; Jude snapped. &ldquo;You pushed me into this. I didn&rsquo;t even want to do it. I&rsquo;m about to get sacked and you&rsquo;re still talking back to my boss.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda stood there shaking, cheek burning, anger and disbelief swirling in her eyes.</p><p>Sapphire watched the scene quietly, then spoke again, her voice cutting through the noise.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you even know who you offended,&rdquo; she asked calmly. &ldquo;Do you know who he is?&rdquo;</p><p>The room went still.</p><p>Employees leaned forward.</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes slowly shifted to Charles, curiosity and disbelief written on their faces.</p><p>Did she really know him?</p><p>And who exactly was he to her?.</p><p>They thought in their mind, because this was the first time they saw sapphire angry. Totally outburst.</p><p>At that moment, Sapphire knew she had slipped.</p></div>
