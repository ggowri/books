        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div>Tracy was stunned at how Charles had discovered this.. something she had wanted to bury forever. Now he had found it, and it was his reason for leaving.<br/>“No, Charles. You can’t just walk away like this! You are overreacting!” she seethed to herself.<br/>Her fingers fumbled for her phone. She had to call him.<br/>“You can’t live without me. You begged me to marry you so persistently. You don’t have any remarkable background. Without me, you’re nothing!” she whispered desperately, as though he could hear her thoughts.<br/>She pressed the phone to her ear.<br/>“How dare you think you can just declare the end of our marriage! I’ve already told you I won’t agree!”.<br/>The line rang. No answer. Ring after ring, each one tightened her chest. Her pulse thudded in her throat.<br/>Then her mind flashed to the fire mission he had mentioned.<br/>Her thoughts spiraled. If he went out on that mission… Why hasn’t he returned? Why was his phone still dead?<br/>A cold, paralyzing dread coiled through her veins. What if something happened?<br/>Tracy dropped heavily onto the sofa, her hands trembling as she dialed again and again. Still nothing.<br/>Finally, she called Mr. Zoe, her house assistant.<br/>“Ms. Tracy, what can I do for you?”<br/>Her voice cracked with urgency. “Check for fires in the city these past few days. Now.”<br/>He hesitated only a beat before replying firmly, “Yes, Ma.”<br/>Confused but obedient, he ended the call. Strange, he muttered to himself. She’s never been this worried before.<br/>Minutes crawled by in unbearable silence until Tracy’s phone chimed. A message from Mr. Zoe.<br/>[Ma, no city fires recently. But… there was a massive wildfire in a neighboring town. It was devastating. Most of the nearby firefighters didn’t survive. I heard Mr. Charles was sent in three days ago, before another gas leak caused an even bigger fire. There are no survivors yet.]<br/>Tracy’s body went rigid. She shot to her feet, trembling uncontrollably. What if something happened to him? Charles had told her days ago he might die in the rescue, but she hadn’t taken him seriously.<br/>Now, his life was uncertain.<br/>Her fingers shook as she typed: [Is the fire contained? Any word about Charles?]<br/>Mr. Zoe replied: [Situation still unclear. The fire’s mostly under control now. But, like I said, no survivors yet from Mr. Charles’ team.]<br/>Tracy closed her eyes, a broken sigh slipping out.<br/>Her resolve hardened. She typed back: [Find me the exact location of that wildfire. I’m going there.]<br/>[Understood.]<br/>Then Mr. Zoe added: [Also, Mr. Derek mentioned dinner tonight. He said you haven’t replied and asked me to check.]<br/>Tracy frowned. Without hesitation, she typed: [Cancel it. Tell him I’m unavailable.]<br/>[Yes, Ma.]<br/>Ending the call, Tracy grabbed her keys, unable to sit still any longer. Anxiety gnawed at her insides. She stormed out the door.<br/>“What the heck happened to you Charles!”.<br/>Minutes later, her phone buzzed again. Mr. Zoe had sent the address. Tracy barely read it before she grabbed her bag and bolted for the car.<br/>Her grip on the wheel was tight, knuckles white, she muffled to herself,  “Charles… even if you want a divorce, we will do it properly. You can’t just vanish. You can’t just leave me like this”. <br/>The drive felt endless, her chest rising and falling in short, uneven breaths. The closer she got, the darker the path became.<br/>When she reached the area, chaos swallowed her. Sirens wailed. Cars were abandoned in the middle of the road, drivers craning their necks, people shouting over one another. <br/>Tracy slammed the car door and forced her way into the crowd. Her heels caught in cracks, but she shoved forward. “Charles!” Her voice cracked, raw and desperate. “Charles, where are you? Where the hell are you?” <br/>Nobody answered. Her eyes darted wildly across the scene , exhausted firefighters staggering out. Some of them are injured. She checked them round and Charles wasn't among them.<br/>Then she froze.<br/>Beside her, Laid out in uneven rows on the ground were bodies of firefighters. They were covered in white sheets, only the faint outlines of boots or scorched uniforms showed who they once were.<br/>Tracy’s knees almost buckled. She couldn’t breathe. Families crowded around, each one lifting the sheet over a face, the moment they recognized their loved ones. They cried and wailed. <br/>“No,” she whispered, shaking her head violently. “No… Charles isn’t here. He can’t be.”<br/>She wanted to walk away; her feet betrayed her, dragging her forward, closer to the row of still forms. Her hands trembled uncontrollably as she reached for the edge of one white cloth, her throat thick with dread.<br/>“Charles…” she breathed. “Don’t you dare be under here.”<br/>She started checking one after another,  raising the white clothes.<br/>“Not him…”.<br/>“Not him either…”.<br/>She made sure to check each and every one of them and Charles wasn't among. She sighed in relief. <br/>But that doesn't eliminate the possibility of the same fate, because dead bodies were still being carried out.<br/>Meanwhile, From a distance, Charles emerged, supporting an injured firefighter between his arms. Sweat streaked his face, soot smudged his uniform, but his eyes caught movement across the chaotic scene. <br/>There she was. Tracy, his wife. No, his ex-wife was looming through the crowd like a ghost. Her eyes scanned desperately, her hands trembling.<br/> For a moment, time seemed to slow, the sirens and shouts fading into a distant hum.<br/>Shock tightened his chest. He wondered what she was here for.<br/>But, he saw as her lips called for his name.<br/> For him? But why? His mind raced, flitting back to the memory that refused to leave him: the hotel room, her ordering the condom with Derek, and the  video.  <br/>Nothing could erase that. Nothing.<br/>“What's her real deal?”.<br/>He could see the worry etched across her face with frantic energy and desperation. For a second, a flicker of doubt gnawed at him. <br/>Did she still… care? Was she regretting what had happened, or had she come to beg?<br/>No.<br/>He straightened, He was a  man with dignity, he reminded himself. He might be the poorest man on earth, stripped of fortune, of comfort, of anything the world had promised. But not dignity. <br/>No matter of love would change that.<br/>He was no longer the Charles she once knew. That man had already died in the fire. This was his new self, and he wanted nothing to do with her again. Every time he laid eyes on her, it unearthed a fresh wound in his heart.<br/>He let the injured man lean on his shoulder, stepped away from the crowd, and started walking away.<br/>His eyes, however, lingered. On her. Tracy, still frenzied, still looking for him.<br/>This was over. Finally over for him.</div>
