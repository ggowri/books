        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div><p>Serena had already finished two glasses of alcohol before Charles arrived at the bar.</p><p>He spotted her from afar, gulping down another glass, and immediately knew something was wrong. </p><p>He walked over and, just as she was about to down another drink, he grabbed the glass from her hand.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing? Why are you trying to drink yourself senseless?” Charles asked as he sat beside her.</p><p>But the two glasses had already done their job.</p><p>“Hey, look who we have here,” she slurred. “My future husband!”</p><p>Charles sighed and shook his head. “What are you saying? Did something happen at home?” </p><p>That was the only explanation he could think of that would make Serena drink like this.</p><p>“Oh, right. I forgot,” she said bitterly. “We were only fake engaged.”</p><p>Charles leaned closer. “Hey, you are shouting.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, Charles,” Serena said. “I called you here today to break the fake engagement.”</p><p>Charles froze. “What? Why so sudden? Have you become the CEO already?”</p><p>Serena scoffed and drained another glass. This time, Charles didn’t stop her.</p><p>“Because I will never become the CEO.”</p><p>She laughed hollowly. “You know, I really wanted to be CEO. It’s been my dream since childhood. I wanted to lead a company, and I worked hard for it. So hard. I was stupid for dedicating everything I had to that family. I thought helping my father, helping his company grow, would make him recognize me. But he’s just a coward and a hypocrite.”</p><p>The words spilled out, sharp and venomous. She told Charles everything—every detail of what had happened.</p><p>“Dynamics Aurelia will never accept me,” she added. “They will choose Collins because he will have a prospectus to submit.”</p><p>A prospectus was professionally audited, backed by verified companies, signed guarantees, and real numbers.</p><p>It didn’t sell ideas. It showed leverage. Any corporation that reviewed it would see one thing clearly—the partnership was profitable, stable, and inevitable.</p><p>Hearing this, Charles couldn’t help but scoff. After all, he was literally the owner of Aurelia Dynamics.</p><p>Serena stared at him. “Is that supposed to be funny?”</p><p>Charles looked at her steadily. “Is that the reason you want to drink yourself like this?”</p><p>Serena let out a bitter laugh. “Why wouldn’t it be? I am about to lose everything to Collins. And we both know he’s going to ruin it all.”</p><p>“Relax,” Charles said calmly. “Aurelia Dynamics will accept your own proposal.”</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, then shook her head. In her mind, he was only trying to encourage her.</p><p> “You don’t have to comfort me,” she said quietly. “Collins will outrun me in this”</p><p>Charles leaned closer. “So what? You are going to back down because of that? You do not have to care about Collins or anyone you’re afraid might do better than you. Just go out there, do your thing, be yourself, and give it everything you have got. Do all you can to be accepted. You will see how things turn in your favor.”</p><p>Serena stared at him. His words stirred something of a small spark of courage. Still, she convinced herself he was only trying to lift her spirits.</p><p>She smiled faintly. “Wow. I actually love that. It almost makes me want to sleep with you,” she said bluntly, then added with a soft laugh, “but I know you would just refuse.”</p><p>Charles swallowed hard at her words but said nothing.</p><p>They both went quiet after that, ordering more drinks and drifting into another conversation, talking about random things.</p><p>By the end of the night, both of them were drunk.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, they booked a room together and spent the night.</p><p>The next morning, Serena was the first to wake up.</p><p>Charles was lying beside her.</p><p>Her eyes widened immediately as she checked beneath the sheets, her body tensing. After a brief moment, she realized nothing happened.</p><p>She hadn’t been touched.</p><p>“What… really?” she muttered under her breath. Because she remembered intentionally throwing herself on Charles. </p><p>Her voice stirred Charles awake. He groaned softly and turned toward her. “Mm… you are awake.”</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief. “Seriously? You didn’t touch me all night. After everything. Are you gay, or do you just hate me?”</p><p>Charles looked at her quietly. Her face was bare, her hair slightly messy, but she was still stunning. Any man would want her, especially when her small round breast is staring at you. </p><p>He did. But that wasn’t the point. He didn’t want to waste  a virgin sex  like that. He was savouring It for his upgrade. </p><p>“Uhmm… I just want to be respectful”. He made the lame excuse</p><p>Serena blinked, and just scoffed. </p><p>She stood up from the bed and stretched. </p><p>“Well, I’m going to do what you said yesterday. I will meet with Aurelia Dynamics and at least try. Who knows, maybe a miracle will happen, just like you said.”</p><p>Charles sat up slightly. “Mm… should I follow you?”</p><p>Serena looked back at him and smiled. “Sure.”</p><p>By mid-afternoon, the two of them were already on their way to Winchester.</p><p>Serena wanted to move fast. If she could get there first, maybe luck would finally be on her side. If Aurelia Dynamics accepted her proposal before Collins arrived, everything could still change.</p><p>After hours on the road, they finally reached Aurelia Dynamics Enterprises.</p><p>It was the biggest building in Winchester.</p><p>The place was alive. Business executives and assistants moved in and out nonstop, luxury cars pulling up every few minutes. The atmosphere alone screamed power.</p><p>As Serena and Charles stepped toward the entrance, a familiar male voice echoed behind them.</p><p>“Wow. You acted nonchalant, but you’re so desperate you rushed here quickly.”</p><p>Serena stopped in her tracks and let out a slow sigh.</p><p>She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.</p><p>Collins.</p><p>Both of them turned around. It was truly Collins with Tracy beside him. They were both smiling and feeling so confident.</p><p></p><p></p></div>
