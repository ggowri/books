        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div><p>“What the fuck are we going to do? She’s coming here!” Mrs. Hailey trembled, terrified of being caught.</p><p>“How the hell should I know, you whore? Get dressed!” Derek yelled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tracy was inches from her room. </p><p>She pushed the door open to see Derek—shirtless—on a stool, his head stuck under the AC like he was fixing something. He already had his trousers on. Mrs. Hailey stood nearby in just her bra and skirt, both of them sweating.</p><p>“Mmm, what’s happening?” Tracy squinted.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey scoffed. “I decided to rest in your room, but noticed the AC wasn’t blowing, so I called Derek to help fix it.”</p><p>Derek pulled his head out and smiled. “You’re back. Something got stuck inside the AC and stopped it working, so I came to help.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey added, “It was so hot I had to remove my clothes.” They kept explaining.</p><p>Tracy looked at Derek with admiration. “Derek, how can I thank you enough? My mother called for help and you came immediately. That was so sweet and kind. I know you must have been busy, yet you came. You keep impressing me.”</p><p>Derek stared at Tracy, delighted she bought the story. “I’ll do everything and anything for you—to satisfy you and your mother.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey rushed to Tracy. “Look, I think it’s high time you marry Mr. Derek. He’s a strong man who knows how to handle a woman well. He’ll care for you, and I can testify you’ll enjoy him in every aspect. Please consider him and forget about that fool Charles.”</p><p>Tracy sighed. True, Derek had been impressing her, but something inside didn’t want her to pursue a relationship with him. </p><p>“Okay, Mom, I’ll take it into consideration,” she said.</p><p>Then Derek flipped on the AC, and it started blowing.</p><p>Tracy clapped. “Wow, you fixed it!”</p><p>Derek puffed out his chest, proud of fixing something that wasn’t broken. “It’s nothing,” he said.</p><p>Her mother asked, “So why are you home so early?”</p><p>“Mom, I forgot some documents—I need them right now. You know what? I got a call from my friends: I will be named the best female businesswoman of the year tomorrow morning by the IAA and will be celebrated at the next big banquet. Do you know what that means? It means I will be introduced to every business person in the country, and doors will open to vast opportunities with so much respect!” she said excitedly.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s eyes went wide, her hands flying to her mouth. “Tracy! My baby girl! Oh my God, the IAA? The International Awards Associate? That’s the biggest honor in the country!” </p><p>She rushed forward and crushed Tracy in a hug, tears already shining. </p><p>“I’m so proud of you! You’ve worked your whole life for this. My daughter—the businesswoman of the year!”</p><p>Derek forced a beaming smile, stepping down from the stool. “Tracy, you are the best. Hands down. No one deserves it more.” He wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her close. “This is just the beginning. The whole world’s about to know your name.”</p><p>Tracy laughed, cheeks flushed. “Thank you, both of you. I still can’t believe it.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey dabbed her eyes. “When’s the banquet? I’m buying a new dress. Front row, screaming your name!”</p><p>Tracy grinned. “Next week. But first—” she turned to Derek, playful. “What about that investment about the company that you promised big returns.”</p><p>Derek’s grin didn’t waver. “I have already invested your money in them, by the end of this month, sweetheart. You will see profits you can’t even count… trust me”.</p><p>Tracy smiled at her new bright future. </p><p>××××</p><p>The next day, Charles dressed up to go meet Natasha and make some blind-cutting deal so he could get the sapphire he needed to power up his new ability.</p><p>Lizzypie told him, “You must be thrilled about this. But I have to remind you—your time for the second mission is ticking. Mr. Vincent is pressing me and doubting you. When are you doing it?”</p><p>Charles sighed. He couldn’t let himself ruin everything Tracy had worked for.</p><p>Just then, the TV news announcement caught their attention.</p><p>The anchor’s voice blared from the screen: “Breaking news from the IAA! The Best Businesswoman of the Year has been selected, and the honor goes to… Ms. Serena!”</p><p>A loud pop of confetti graphics exploded across the feed. Serena’s polished headshot filled the frame, all sharp cheekbones and confident smile.</p><p>“After her record-breaking acquisitions and groundbreaking partnerships this quarter, it’s a well-deserved win,”</p><p> The reporter continued. “At the Grand National Banquet next week, Ms. Serena will deliver a keynote address, and meet many influential people… alongside her fiancé, Mr. Charles.”</p><p>Another pop. Charles’s own photo flashed up beside hers. Charles was so surprised to see himself there. </p><p>Serena told him their relationship would be fake and secret, but yet he was publicising it everywhere.</p><p>“Wow, you’re going viral!” Lizzypie crowed, eyes glued to the screen.</p><p>Charles blinked at his own face. “why did they… put my name in?”</p><p>Lizzypie spun to him, half-laughing. “It’s a huge day, Charles. Senators, investors, every power player in the country. They love a woman with a solid man beside her. And she chose you. You will give a speech, too.”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly.</p><p>Lizzypie’s grin faded into something sharper. “Serena, let them use your name for this. That’s not small. Are you still sure the whole thing’s fake?”</p><p>Charles met her gaze. “Yeah. Fake. Don’t overthink it.”</p><p>He grabbed his jacket. “I’m off to see Natasha.”</p><p>When Charles reached Natasha’s store, she already had everything the thugs damage set up. And cleaned it up.</p><p>“Hey, welcome back”, Natasha greeted her, the other night event rushed to her head.</p><p>Charles smiled, and greeted her back. “how are you doing”.</p><p>Natasha replied fine and asked him what he was here for. He told her that he wanted to do a blind stone cutting.</p><p>Natasha was so happy, she didn&#x27;t have any customers recently, and also, most of the stones the customers had been cutting were all empty and it&#x27;s affecting her business.</p><p>She took him to where all the stone was and asked him to pick one as usual. </p><p>But something strange happened. As Charles activated the X-ray eyes and scanned all the stones. They were all empty. Each and everyone of it!. </p></div>
