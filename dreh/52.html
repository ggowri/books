        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div><p>Tracy stormed off with Derek and Mrs. Hailey. While Charles just walked back to others.</p><p>Before he could take a breath, Serena cut in, her voice crisp as glass.</p><p>“You will be following me home tonight.”</p><p>It wasn’t a request, more like a command.</p><p>Charles blinked, startled, pointing at himself. “Me? Tonight? Right now?”</p><p>“Yes, of course. You are my fiancé,” she said, her tone sharp with authority. “It would look ridiculous for you to linger around here, stirring trouble. I won’t have you tarnishing my image. So… you are coming with me.”</p><p>Charles turned instinctively toward Lizzypie, guilt tugging at him for leaving her behind. But Lizzypie only shrugged with careless detachment.</p><p>“Okay. We will meet later,” she said simply, and walked away without another word.</p><p>Fred stepped forward and opened the car door. Serena swept inside without hesitation. After a moment’s pause, Charles followed.</p><p>The ride was tense. Serena sat with her arms folded, lips pressing and parting as if she wanted to speak but restrained herself.</p><p>Charles kept his eyes on the passing city lights.</p><p>Finally, she broke the silence.</p><p>“That girl… Lizzypie. How did you even become friends with her?”</p><p>Charles stiffened, caught off guard. “Lizzypie? Uh… from childhood. We grew up together.” It was a lie, but it slipped out easily.</p><p>Serena’s eyes narrowed, sharp as a blade. She had already run background checks on him. Every detail. Every name. Lizzypie had never appeared. Still, she let the subject drop and didn’t push further.</p><p>The car slowed before the looming Moretti building. Its mirrored glass glimmered under floodlights, armed guards stationed at every corner, rifles gleaming. Charles swallowed hard, his gaze darting nervously.</p><p>Inside, Serena led him through wide marble halls until they reached a secluded wing. She pushed open a door, revealing a lavish apartment.</p><p>“This,” she said, turning with a smile that felt both inviting and possessive, “is our home.”</p><p>Charles’s throat tightened. “Our… home? You mean we’ll be living here? Together?”</p><p>“Of course,” Serena answered smoothly, as though it had been decided long before. “We’re a couple. Aren’t we?”</p><p>The way she said it made it sound undeniable.</p><p>“I’m tired,” she murmured, her voice softening as she walked further into the room. Without warning, she began undressing—first her blouse, sliding off her shoulders, then her skirt, pooling at her feet. Within moments, she stood in nothing but a bra and panties.</p><p>Charles’s breath caught. Her body was all curves and lines, a sculpted figure-eight. Her skin gleamed under the soft lights, smooth and flawless.</p><p>Her breasts weren’t large, but perfectly shaped, the roundness pressing against the fabric of her bra. Even beneath it, the outline of her nipples was clear, pointing at Charles.</p><p>X-ray activated.</p><p>He scanned her from head to breast and could now see them without the bra. It was so tempting, like it was drawing him to touch.</p><p>For a moment… he forgot to breathe.</p><p>Serena caught his gaze.</p><p>“What? You want to see me naked?”</p><p>Charles jerked back, blinking fast. “N-no. No, of course not.”</p><p>“But you’re looking at me like you do,” she teased. “You can say whatever you want, Charles.”</p><p>His pulse hammered. A part of him wanted to confess, but he whispered to himself:</p><p>What if she sees me as perverted? She’ll throw me out. My chance will be ruined.</p><p>So he straightened, masking desire with forced restraint. “No. I don’t want anything.”</p><p>The night grew heavy with awkwardness after that. Serena disappeared into the bathroom to freshen up, while Charles paced the room, struggling not to replay the sight of her in his mind.</p><p>He took his bath quickly, avoiding her eyes when he emerged.</p><p>When it came time for sleep, Charles offered, “I will take the couch.”</p><p>Serena tilted her head. “Till how long? We’ll be living together for at least a month. You’re my fiancé. You belong beside me.”</p><p>He hesitated, wanting to remind her that all this was fake, but then just reluctantly lay on the far side of the bed. While, Serena lay down like it was nothing.  Within minutes. She drifted into sleep.</p><p>Charles, however, lay stiff as stone. His eyes stayed wide open for hours, listening to the steady rhythm of Serena’s breathing beside him. Only when exhaustion crushed him did sleep finally claim him.</p><p>The next morning, Charles was woken up by Serena tapping his shoulder. She told him he would be meeting her family that morning.</p><p>“You will tell them what you told me, about making us independent from Mr. Vasilios, and how you will increase the family revenue.”</p><p>Charles was surprised. It felt sudden. He had only said that because he wanted Serena’s engagement, and he didn’t even have a clear plan yet.</p><p>But Serena gave him no chance to talk. So he bathed, dressed up, and they made their way to the grand dining room, where all the family assembled every morning for breakfast as tradition.</p><p>As soon as Serena and Charles arrived, whispers started flying around.</p><p>Serena ignored them all and bowed at her father at the far end.</p><p>“Good morning, Father… hope you had a nice rest,” she said.</p><p>“Good morning,” he replied. He already knew who Charles was, but chose not to speak, waiting for Serena to introduce him herself.</p><p>“Father… this is my fiancé. We are set to be engaged. You already know him…Charles,” she introduced.</p><p>Charles gently bowed.</p><p>Then, Mr. Moretti cleared his throat and began, “Serena, I am sorry… but you cannot be engaged to him! You can never marry him.”</p></div>
