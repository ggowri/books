        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone froze immediately and turned.</p><p>An old man stood there, wrapped in a long dark robe and heavy cloak, his presence alone pressing down on the entire courtyard like an unseen weight.&nbsp;</p><p>His hair was white, his back straight, and was gazing at them like he was a lion.&nbsp;</p><p>Every single guard dropped to one knee.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Hierem!&rdquo;</p><p>The shout rose as one, filled with fear and reverence. So this was him. The true leader of the Hierem clan.</p><p>At that moment, another figure stepped out from behind him.</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s breath caught.</p><p>It was Lizzy.</p><p>&ldquo;Lizzy!&rdquo; Charles shouted instinctively, his body moving forward without thinking.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t get far.</p><p>Men poured out from every direction, from left to right corridors, inner gates, surrounding him in seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>There were too many to count, easily over three hundred, forming a tight ring around him, their presence heavy and unnatural. Charles could feel it instantly. Every one of them carried power.</p><p>He stopped andgulped.</p><p>Across the courtyard, Lizzy stared at him in disbelief, her eyes wide as shock washed over her face. &ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; she shouted back, her voice trembling.</p><p>Lord Hierem&rsquo;s gaze shifted to the ground where Jeremy knelt, battered and humiliated. Rage flickered across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you,&rdquo; he thundered, his voice echoing. &ldquo;You caused a ruckus and fought when you knew you could not win. You keep disgracing me.&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped closer, his tone cold. &ldquo;You are not worthy of being the heir of this clan.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s face burned with shame as his head dropped.</p><p>Then Lord Hierem turned to Charles.</p><p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;What do you want? Who the hell are you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles met his gaze without backing down. &ldquo;Maybe I should be asking you people,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;why are you hoarding my friend.&rdquo;</p><p>A man immediately stepped forward. &ldquo;Watch your mouth. If you dare speak such foul words against Lord Hierem again, we will not hesitate to kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed and repeated. &ldquo;Fuck him.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t even flinch.</p><p>Several men shifted forward, killing intent flaring, but Lord Hierem raised a single hand and they stopped instantly.</p><p>He studied Charles for a moment, then spoke calmly. &ldquo;He looks like nothing more than a loyal friend who is completely clueless.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned fully to Charles. &ldquo;Who told you we are hoarding her. She is here of her own accord.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned and turned toward Lizzy. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy swallowed hard, then let out a slow sigh.</p><p>Lord Hierem nodded. &ldquo;I should not let your disrespect go scot-free,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it seems ignorance is your only crime.&rdquo;</p><p>He waved his hand lightly. &ldquo;I will leave you two to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Then his gaze snapped back to Jeremy. &ldquo;You. Come with me. Now!!!.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Hierem turned and walked away.</p><p>Jeremy muttered under his breath, &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; knowing exactly what awaited him.</p><p>As Lord Hierem left, the men followed, peeling away one after another, until the courtyard slowly emptied.</p><p>After everyone left, the courtyard felt strangely empty, the tension still hanging in the air as Lizzy stood there staring at Charles</p><p>&nbsp;Then she walked to him.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same moment, Natasha hurried closer to them.</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t move. He just stared at Lizzy in disbelief, his chest tight, anger and relief tangled together as he finally spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck would you come all the way here without telling me?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy slowed to a stop in front of him and sighed, brushing her hair back with shaking fingers. &ldquo;Why are you even here?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p><p>Charles scoffed, the sound sharp. &ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked away for a second, then said, &ldquo;I left you a letter.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles let out a bitter laugh. &ldquo;A letter? You really think that cuts it? You didn&rsquo;t tell me anything. You didn&rsquo;t tell me where you were going. You just left a fucking letter. Do you know how worried I was?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy bit her lip, her eyes dropping as she took in the fury in his face. She understood Charles's frustration.</p><p>&nbsp;To Charles, she wasn&rsquo;t just a friend. She was family. The closest person to him.&nbsp;</p><p>She breathed out slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I had to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha frowned slightly and stepped closer. &ldquo;Had to be here?&rdquo; she asked carefully. &ldquo;I hope everything is alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles turned his eyes back to Lizzy, his expression hardening again. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;.</p><p>Lizzy nodded slowly, her fingers tightening together as if bracing herself, then she said, &ldquo;I had to complete a mind-journeying ritual for Jeremy, and after that, I will have to marry him and stay here forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Both Charles and Natasha frowned instantly, the explanation landing heavy and wrong.</p><p>Natasha let out a short scoff before she could stop herself. &ldquo;Is that even real? A ritual?&rdquo;</p><p>Her head spun as she spoke. Everything has been overwhelming for her. She just witnessed Charles turn to Flash, dark aura&nbsp; and clans stuff, and now she was being told about mind-journeying rituals like it was casual conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles stared at Lizzy, disbelief hardening into something sharper. &ldquo;Are you teasing me right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy shook her head quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being real,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice dropped. &ldquo;And after that, I had to marry Jeremy.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s jaw tightened.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Lizzy continued quietly. &ldquo;Nothing could be done about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed,&nbsp; as frustration bled into his voice. &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t a joke, I don&rsquo;t even know what to call it. Stop this nonsense and let&rsquo;s leave here. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; Lizzy said softly, shaking her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>She took a breath, steadying herself. &ldquo;I made a pledge to the Hierem clan. I agreed to help them retrieve the Kyoul Stone from the Hole Realm.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Hole Realm?, what's&nbsp; that&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy nodded. &ldquo;The most dangerous realm. A place where people don&rsquo;t usually come back from.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned as he listened to her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a realm only women are allowed to enter,&rdquo; Lizzy continued, her voice low. &ldquo;And even then, survival is almost impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at him, and added. &ldquo;If I am able to survive there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will also have to marry Jeremy.&rdquo;</p></div>
