        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div>Smash!<br/>Charles stumbled back just in time. The chandelier crashed down, exploding into a thousand shards across the floor. Splinters of glass rained like knives…one jagged piece sliced into his head. <br/>Hot blood gushed down his face, blinding his vision, dripping into his eyes and onto his shirt.<br/>Tracy screamed. She darted toward him, her face twisted with panic. “Charles! Charles, are you okay? Are you?!” Her voice cracked, trembling with raw fear as her hands fumbled to stop the bleeding. <br/>For the first time in years, Charles saw her stripped bare of composure…genuinely shaken, desperate. She wanted to cry.<br/>For one fleeting heartbeat, he has hope. Maybe she does love him. Maybe, beneath all the coldness, she still cares. Maybe this has all been a misunderstanding.<br/>Then a child’s cry cut through the chaos.<br/>“Mom! Dad is bleeding too, from his hand!” Francis’s small voice wavered.<br/>Tracy’s head snapped around. Derek was sitting beside Francis, clutching his hand. A shallow cut glistened red where a shard had grazed him.<br/>Without hesitation, Tracy abandoned Charles’s side. She rushed to Derek, gripping his hand as if his life depended on it. “Are you okay? Are you okay?” Her words poured out in frantic repetition.<br/>“I’m fine,” Derek insisted, shaking his head. “It’s just a scratch. Go to Charles, he’s worse.”<br/>But Francis pleaded, “Mom, no! Please, let’s take Dad to the hospital first!”<br/>Charles swayed, struggling to stay upright, vision tilting, blood soaking his shirt. He watched, helpless, as Tracy hovered over Derek. She will come back. She has to.<br/>Derek’s wound was nothing. Common sense said she should choose him…her husband, the man bleeding out on the floor. Even Derek seemed to know it.<br/>But Tracy’s voice was steel. “Charles is strong. He will survive. You are the one we must save. ”<br/>And with that, she dragged Derek to his feet and rushed him out of the restaurant, leaving Charles in a pool of his own blood.<br/>He couldn’t believe it. Even strangers would have stayed with him. Even Derek, the rival she clung to, had seen the truth of who needed help first. Yet Tracy… his wife… had walked away. Left him to die. While all of this shattered glass, this bleeding head..was because of her.<br/>It wasn’t Tracy who saved him. It was shocked diners, trembling staff, people who didn’t even know his name, who finally lifted him up and carried him to the hospital.<br/>By nightfall, the doctors had stitched the wound, cleaned the blood, and stabilized him. But Charles felt hollow, his body weak, his soul weaker still. Lying in the hospital bed, he reached for his phone, clinging to the faint hope of a missed call, a message.<br/>There was nothing. Not a single word from Tracy. Not even to ask if he was alive. The silence screamed louder than the chandelier’s crash.<br/>Hours later, a notification lit up his screen. His chest tightened. He almost laughed. Now she remembers? He scoffed bitterly. “You’re just texting me now? After all this while?”<br/>He opened the message, expecting a shallow excuse, maybe even forced concern. What he saw instead hollowed him out completely:<br/>> Charles, don’t come home. Francis is concerned. He says every time you’re around, you’re angry, and it puts him in danger. He says he doesn’t like being near you. So until everything is okay, you shouldn’t come home. Your luggage is in a hotel; my assistant will call you to drive you there. Goodnight.<<br/>Charles froze, horrified.<br/>First, he caught her cheating...she denied it. Then she brought Derek’s son into their home, trying to force him to adopt. Then she left him bleeding, close to death, while she saved Derek. And now… now she literally sent him away for Derek’s child.<br/>It was obvious. Tracy was gone. Deep in love with Derek. But she wouldn’t accept a breakup.<br/>Lying there in the hospital bed, Charles made up his mind. He would never step foot in that house again. He wouldn’t even bother fighting anymore. So that didn’t frighten him.<br/>Instead, he called the assistant, Mr. Zoe, asking about his luggage.<br/>He arrived at the hotel, was given the key to the room, and planned not to sleep there. He would just get his luggage and leave. As he was packing everything, he saw a laptop.<br/>Tracy’s laptop.<br/>The assistant must have thought it was his. He had set it outside. Charles looked at it for a moment, then decided to have a look.<br/>It was password locked. He tried her birthday, which was invalid, and many other combinations he could think of.<br/>He was about to give up when he tried their anniversary date...and behold! It opened.<br/>He scoffed. All of her things make no sense. He opened it and saw that there was nothing he could do with it.<br/>He was about to close the laptop when a bing echoed. A WhatsApp notification.<br/>It was from Derek.<br/>Curious, Charles opened the app. At the very top of Tracy’s chat list was Derek’s name, pinned and bright. His own name sat far below, muted with a grey speaker icon. She had muted him. No wonder she never replied to his messages...he didn’t even matter enough for her to hear the sound of him.<br/>His jaw clenched, but he pressed Derek’s chat.<br/>The newest message had just arrived...a series of photos, followed by a single line:<br/>“Upload it to your Instagram ❤️.”<br/>Charles’s hand shook as he clicked the images.<br/>The first batch hit him like knives. Tracy and Derek together in different locations, restaurants, streets, even malls, laughing, eating, dressed in matching clothes, holding hands. Anyone who saw them would think they were a happy couple.<br/>The next set was worse. Tracy, Derek, and Francis, posing together. Some pictures showed them like a perfect family, Francis in the middle while Tracy and Derek flanked him with wide smiles.<br/>Then came the final photos. Tracy and Derek, drinking from the same glass, their faces close, her smile carefree and glowing. She looked alive, radiant...happier than she had ever been with Charles.<br/>His stomach turned. He squinted, studying the background of the photos. Then his eyes froze.<br/>The curtains. The couch. The paintings on the wall.<br/>It was their house.<br/>He checked the timestamps on the images...five minutes ago.<br/>The intimate, laughing moments he was staring at were happening right inside his home.<br/>And now he understood. That was why she told him not to come back. She had cleared him out, pushed him away, so she could openly play wife to Derek in the very space that used to be his.<br/>Charles’s chest burned, fury and despair twisting inside him until he could hardly breathe. But what could a poor man like him do?.</div>
