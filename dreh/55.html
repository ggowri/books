        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div>Collins shot up from his seat. “What? Are you serious with this?” he barked. “Serena just blabbed about that a few minutes ago, and now you are affirming it?”.<br/>Allison chimed in, “This man really needs to go to a psychiatric hospital. Ordinary you? to talk to Mr. Vasilios about business. That man doesn't play with his money and source of income!”.<br/>Mr. Moretti rubbed his forehead wearily and added.<br/> “You might think Mr. Vasilios is soft or kind because of your little encounter with him,” he said, his voice heavy with disbelief. “You might think that…But in business, he doesn’t play with anyone.”<br/>Charles stepped forward, refusing to back down. “I can do it,” he said again, firmer this time.<br/>Norman let out a mocking laugh. “How? What the hell are you even saying?” he sneered. “How can a poor, no-background firefighter convince Mr. Vasilios of anything? You are desperate, doing everything to get Miss Serena’s attention. Pathetic pauper man!”<br/>Charles just ignored him.<br/>Serena stood there, stunned. Although Charles had promised her he could turn things around, she had only agreed to give him a chance because she wanted to use him as her fake fiancé. But this was madness.<br/>To her, what he was claiming sounded impossible.<br/>“Charles,” Mr. Moretti said sternly, “just drop it already. You can’t do it. You are not even fit for this family.”<br/>Charles looked at him squarely. “What about this,” he said slowly, his eyes sweeping across the room. “Let’s make it a bet. Whoever manages to convince Mr. Vasilios to stop the charges… will be the one to marry Miss Serena.”<br/>For a second, there was silence. Then laughter erupted.<br/>Collins doubled over, clutching his stomach. “Listen to him…talking like he even has a chance!”<br/>Another relative chimed in between snickers. “He’s losing his mind. Just spitting nonsense to sound brave!”<br/>Norman smirked, shaking his head. “You don’t really mean it, do you?” he said mockingly.<br/>Charles met his gaze. “I have never been more serious in my life.”<br/>Serena leaned toward him, whispering sharply, “Are you stupid? How can you just say that? It’s obvious you can’t win. You’re only pushing me closer to him!”<br/>But Charles didn’t answer. His eyes were cold, determined.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr. Moretti leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. An idea crept into his mind. Maybe this was the perfect chance to get rid of Charles once and for all. There was no way a man like him could win against Norman. Mr. Vasilios would never take him seriously.<br/>He nodded slowly. “Alright,” he said at last, his voice calm but calculated. “If that’s how you want it… then let’s make it official.”<br/>He turned toward Norman. “Norman, are you in?”<br/>Norman smirked, “I can't believe I would be playing this stupid game with him. It is obvious I would win. My father and Mr. Vasilios has some good history, he would listen to him in a heartbeat! What's your own connection ”.<br/>Charles faced him, “Are you in or not?… Or are you scared?”.<br/>Norman burst into laughter,  “Haha… You are just defining the state you are in now… you are the scared one. I am fucking in!”.<br/>Mr. Moretti straightened as he faced Serena. “You have a say in this, Do you agree to marry whoever convinces Mr. Vasilios to stop charging us?”<br/>Serena’s face went white with fury. She felt like a prize on an auction block, the subject of a bet, a token to be traded. She hesitated and was about to say no.<br/>Collins jumped in.  “What? Are you scared now? You now see your so-called fiancé can’t do shit. He’s just blabbing. This whole thing is pointless if you stop being stubborn.”<br/>Norman stepped forward, lips thin. “There’s no use in this bet if you just break the engagement now, Beauty”.<br/>Serena bit her lips in anxiety.<br/>Charles watched her, and could see she didn't want to do this. <br/>He leaned toward her, close enough that only she could hear. “Please, say yes to this. I can do it, Serena. Trust me”.<br/>“Trust you?. Can you even trust yourself”, she sneered.<br/>“Then, it is left for you to choose. If you refuse,  they will keep pressuring you to marry him. Just have some faith in me”. Charles told her.<br/>After a long thought,  she let out a long sigh, “You better be right,  and you better win, or else. I will kill you myself,” she murmured, then turned around and snapped aloud, “Fine. Yes. I agree with it”.<br/>Everyone smiled.<br/>“If it’s a bet,” Norman said, “then we should have consequences. This poor man knows he can't win  and he’s just wasting our time— let’s make the failure costly. His leg should be broken if he fails! ”<br/>Everything nodded to this. Norman was  already projecting himself as the winner.<br/>Charles then added. “Okay, then I will break yours too if I fail.”<br/> Norman barked a laugh “Keep dreaming, real life will touch you soon.”<br/>Mr. Moretti then chimed in.  “Very well then. You both have a week for this.  ”<br/>Norman shrugged, still smiling. “Sounds fair enough. I can't wait to crush this guy.”<br/>After that, the meeting was concluded. For the meantime, Charles would have to leave the family and would stop being Serena's fiancé.<br/>On his way, Serena stopped him. “You better be the one to win and come back as my fiancée. Or else. I will kill you myself… or rather, run away together.”<br/>Charles said, “Mmm.”<br/>Serena immediately turned around and left. <br/>Run away??<br/>He wondered if she really meant it.<br/>After that, he took a taxi and made his way back to Lizzypie's apartment, reaching the room, he was surprised to find the room not locked. <br/>He slightly pushed it, and it opened. He then walked in. Just some few steps in. He could hear some voices, echoing around the room.<br/>“Ohhh... yeah... put it more deeper. Ahhh. Love this. Oh, my anus!”.</div>
