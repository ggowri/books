        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div><p>Serena walked gracefully onto the stage and took the microphone. The hall dimmed, a soft golden spotlight settling over her. She smiled warmly at the audience.</p><p>“Thank you,” she began, her voice steady and elegant. “First of all, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the International Awards Association for this incredible honor.”</p><p>She paused, letting the applause settle.</p><p>“I also want to thank my father, Mr. Moretti, who built the legacy I now stand on. He taught me discipline, integrity, and the courage to dream big.”</p><p>The crowd applauded again. Serena smiled softly, then looked toward Charles.</p><p>“And finally,” she continued, “to my fiancé, Charles… Thank you for being with me, supporting me, believing in me, and walking this journey by my side.”</p><p>Charles’s face softened as the hall lit up with applause. Serena continued:</p><p>“I’ve always dreamed of creating spaces where young business minds can thrive. This award is not the end—it’s only the beginning. I am open to collaborations, ideas, and any mind willing to build something meaningful together.”</p><p>The room erupted into applause once more. Serena bowed her head slightly, then handed the mic back.</p><p>The anchor returned to the stage with a bright smile.</p><p>“That was wonderful. And before we continue, let’s hear a few words from her partner as well. Mr. Charles?”</p><p>Charles froze slightly. He wasn’t used to talking publicly—this was his first time in such a massive hall. Still, he took the mic with a polite nod.</p><p>He swallowed, cleared his throat. “Uh… good evening, everyone. I—”</p><p>From the back of the hall, Derek smirked.</p><p>“Bingo,” he whispered.</p><p>He pulled out his phone quickly and typed one word: NOW.</p><p>Just as Charles was adjusting the mic for his speech, the massive screen behind him flickered.</p><p>People murmured in confusion, heads turning.</p><p>The anchor looked nervous. Serena frowned. Charles paused and glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>Then the screen brightened.</p><p>A video window opened.</p><p>Derek leaned forward and muttered under his breath, “You’re doomed today.”</p><p>And then, the video came to life.</p><p>It was a sex tape. Of two people.</p><p>The woman in the video set her buttocks to the man, who was back shooting him, inserting his cock straight to his kneel.</p><p>Slowly, the grin on Derek was replaced by a shocked expression as his face went rigid. Same as Mrs. Hailey and Tracy.</p><p>The two people in the video were Mrs. Hailey and Derek!. It was their sex tape. Not Charles.</p><p>On the screen, Mrs. Hailey, elegant in her designer gown just minutes ago, now unrecognizable in her raw, her buttocks pressed firmly against Derek. </p><p>His hands gripped her hips, thrusting her with his cock. </p><p>“Fuck me,” Mrs. Hailey’s voice crackled through the speakers. “Fuck me like a dog!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Derek growled in the video, his voice thick with lust. “I will  fuck you just how you want.” He leaned closer, his breath ragged. “How about if Tracy joins us? A good threesome, huh?”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s laugh was breathless, “Don’t worry… she will  come to her senses after leaving that poor Charles… ugh.” Her voice dripped with mockery. “Until then, spoil my holes, babe. Fill me!”</p><p>The crowd erupted into chaos. Whispers turned to shouts, phones raised to capture the scandal unfolding</p><p>Serena’s hand flew to her mouth, her eyes darting from the screen to Charles, who stood there calmly. </p><p>Derek immediately messaged the studio man, “Fuck, cut the video now!!!”</p><p>But nothing happened.</p><p>The anchor was shocked also and stammered,  “T-technical difficulties, please—someone cut the feed!”</p><p>But the video played on, relentlessly. It was like watching a porn. Derek was seriously banging her.</p><p>Shortly after the video stopped and the TV switched off. </p><p>As the screen went black, the hall exploded.</p><p>People screamed over one another, chairs scraped, hands flew to mouths.</p><p>“What—what did I just see?”</p><p>“That’s Tracy’s mother!”</p><p>“No way—Mrs. Hailey?!”</p><p>“Is that Derek? I thought he was her daughter’s boyfriend!”</p><p>“What kind of disgusting nonsense is this?”</p><p>“I can’t believe I witnessed this at a prestigious event!”</p><p>“Who even allows this to air.”</p><p>Voices piled on top of each other, anger and disgust swirling in every corner.</p><p>“That was sick!” someone shouted.</p><p>In the middle of the chaos, Tracy sat frozen.</p><p>The room around her blurred. The lights, the noise, the shouting, all distant, muffled, fading into a ringing in her ears.</p><p> Her mind replayed the moment over and over: Derek… her mother… together… fucking, and they even inserting her name. </p><p>Her hands trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>“No…” she whispered weakly. “No, that can’t be real…”</p><p>But it was real, everyone saw it.</p><p>Her vision stung, tears spilling down her cheeks before she could even wipe them. The humiliation burned through her skin, her throat tightening so hard she could barely breathe. She felt like dying. She in fact, wanted to run mad.</p><p>The crowd parted slightly, pointing to where Derek was. </p><p>“That’s him!....That’s Derek!”</p><p>“The dog who betrayed her with her lover and fuck her mom!”</p><p>“He followed Tracy everywhere — and he was secretly with her mother the whole time?”</p><p>“God, what a monster…”</p><p>Derek stood stiffly, color draining from his face, sweat gathering on his forehead. Every insult hit him like a slap. Cameras flashed. Phones pointed. Whispers turned to shouts.</p><p>He lifted his head slowly — straight at Charles.  The realization hit him like a punch, the video was supposed to expose Charles.</p><p>But instead…It exposed him.</p><p>Charles didn’t say a single word. Instead, a slow, knowing smirk curved at the corner of his lips.</p><p>He had outsmarted them again!.  effortlessly.</p><p>Derek’s knees nearly buckled as rage and humiliation twisted his gut into knots. </p><p>The truth was that Charles and Lizzypie already knew about the tape.</p><p>Ever since they had planted surveillance bugs around Tracy’s house, they overheard everything, every one of their plans.</p><p>They even hacked Derek&#x27;s phone.</p><p>They knew how he planned to upload it, and  when he contacted the studio technician.</p><p>So, Lizzypie and Charles decided to outplay them.</p><p>Before the ceremony, when Derek handed the sex tape to the studio man to air it at the right time, Lizzypie had already gotten to him first and then switched files.</p><p>When the technician uploaded the video to Mrs. Hailey and Derek explicit act. That was what just happened.</p></div>
