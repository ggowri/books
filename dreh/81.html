        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div><p> &quot;What the heck is happening here? What is happening to him? Someone should do something!” Mr. Vasilios was terrified and screamed.</p><p>At that moment the door flung open and the private doctor rushed in. They moved away for him as he started checking Kyle. He tried to hold him down and check his eyes, then he faced his assistant, a nurse, as they brought out the defibrillator.</p><p>“One… two…”</p><p>Shock.</p><p>“One… two…”</p><p>Shock.</p><p>“One… two…”</p><p>Shock.</p><p>He kept doing it for many hours, but it wasn’t working. He checked again, checked his pulse — then he suddenly stopped everything he was doing and faced Mr. Vasilios.</p><p>“Sir, I think this is the day. Your son is dying and he cannot survive this,” the doctor announced.</p><p>Everything blurred in Mr. Vasilios’s eyes as he burst into tears. Even Janet dropped down and began wailing.</p><p>“No… please, save him. Do something — he must live. I will give you whatever you want in this life. I will give you everything. Just save my son,” Mr. Vasilios said, crying and begging the doctor.</p><p>This was the first time anyone could see the mighty Vasilios crying, which meant he cherished his son very much.</p><p>Seeing this as the opportunity, Charles stepped forward. “Like I told you all before, please allow me — before it’s too late. I can treat him.”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and gazed at him. Then Norman said, “You are still on this? How dare you say this at this moment! Don’t you have human feelings?”</p><p>The doctor added, “Treat him? This is sickle cell here — it is incurable! In fact, I have done my best sustaining him all these years, and you think you can save him in this crucial moment?”</p><p>Charles just ignored them and faced Mr. Vasilios. “Please, can you give me a chance? Let me try what’s with me.”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios hesitated, and Norman said, “What the hell is with you? He can’t do anything! He will only disrespect young master Kyle’s body.”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios thought about it and said, “My son is dying. The least we can do for him is respect him. Don’t touch him.”</p><p>Charles said, “So you would rather watch him die than give me a chance?”</p><p>Then Janet, not knowing why, just connected with him somehow, she felt his sincerity. She said, “Father, let us give him a chance. Kyle is dying anyway. We should at least have that faith.”</p><p>The doctor opposed it immediately, saying, “I am the most talented doctor in this world! And who is he? Where is your license?”</p><p>Norman told him, “He isn’t even a doctor!”</p><p>The doctor then said, “He can’t do shit then, because he doesn’t know what he’s doing. I can bet my license on it! Just let young master die peacefully.”</p><p>Janet immediately chimed in again, “All the way, the result will be the same. Father, let’s try him, please.”</p><p>“father, please, just give him the chance, let see what he can truly do—”</p><p>Then Mr. Vasilios sighed and said, “Okay, go on then. Show us whatever you can do.”</p><p>Norman scoffed. “I don’t support this. Also, he’s doing this without any consequences.” Then he faced Charles. “You’re insisting that you can treat him — how sure are you?”</p><p>Charles’s eyes glued on him. “So sure,” he said.</p><p>Norman said, “Then what about we bet? If you don’t treat him, you lose your fingers. All of your fingers! I will cut them off.”</p><p>Charles stared at him, then smiled and said, “Okay, sure. And if I get to treat him, you will lose yours also — they will get cut off.”</p><p>Norman burst into laughter. “I just know you can’t treat him. You will never! it’s impossible!”</p><p>Charles said, “Are you in the bet or not? Our fingers.”</p><p>Norman brazenly said, “Yeah. Fuck, I am so interested. We bet!”</p><p>Charles gazed at Mr. Vasilios. “You bear the witness, right?”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios was surprised by his confidence. He nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Then Charles faced the doctor. “Don’t forget your bet about your license.”</p><p>The doctor arrogantly said, “Shut the fuck up and help us kill him faster.”</p><p>Then they made way for him as he stepped toward Kyle.</p><p>Charles stepped forward and began his show of treatment, though the “magic” was the Figs of Vigour — and he played around to make it look like he was doing something real. He held Kyle down, checked his body, listened to his breathing, felt for a pulse, and kept his hands steady and calm.</p><p>Norman wouldn’t shut up. “I tell you, he doesn’t know any shit!” he spat.</p><p>Charles ignored him and went to check Kyle’s eyes and tongue. He lifted the eyelids, peered into the pupils, then touched the tip of Kyle’s tongue lightly.</p><p>“What the fuck is he even doing? Ignore him!” Norman shouted.</p><p>Charles brought out a small pill and was about to give it to Kyle. Norman howled, “What the heck is that?”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios added, furious, “What is that in his hand? What are you doing with my son?!”</p><p>Charles stayed composed. “This is a pill I developed. Please, just stay calm.”</p><p>Janet gripped her father’s hand and pleaded, “Father, let’s trust his process.”</p><p>The doctor and Norman would not stop. The doctor sneered, “He’s experimenting on him. He has no license, no proof — this is dangerous!”</p><p>Norman joined in, louder: “ he’s a quack!”</p><p>Charles’s jaw tightened. “Enough please, let me concentrate,” he said quietly.</p><p>Janet’s eyes flashed. She leaned toward the nearest guard and ordered, “If they open their mouths again, kill them.” Her voice was flat and terrible.</p><p>The guards obeyed. They fell mute, staring at the floor.</p><p>With the room dead silent, Charles put the pill into Kyle’s mouth and held his jaw gently. He pressed his hand to Kyle’s throat and made him swallow the pill.</p><p>With that, Kyle immediately stopped hyperventilating, and also stopped moving. He suddenly went still.</p><p>Everywhere went mute and silent. Also, Charles just stood there. He didn&#x27;t even know what next, he was just waiting for the pill to have its effects but nothing was happening.</p><p>This made the doctor step forward to it, and pressed his eyes on Kyle&#x27;s chest. Then he popped out his eyes, faced Mr. Vasilios and screamed.</p><p>“Young master is dead!”</p></div>
