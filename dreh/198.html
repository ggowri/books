        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div><p>For a moment, the leader thought Charles had finally agreed.</p><p>He stepped closer and pointed to where he was supposed to sign.  “Good,” he said. “Sign there.”</p><p>Charles took the document.</p><p>He looked down at the paper, then lifted it slowly so everyone could see. His fingers tightened around the edges.</p><p>Then he tore it cleanly in half.</p><p>Sprrrr</p><p>The sound of ripping paper echoed louder, then he dropped it on the floor. </p><p>The leader froze. His eyes widened in disbelief. “You… you just tore it?”</p><p>Charles met his stare. “Yeah,” he said calmly. “Because we are not interested. We are  not selling the store.”</p><p>The leader scoffed despite the pain twisting his face. “Two hundred million dollars,” he said sharply. “And you are  not selling?”</p><p>Charles stepped forward, c. “Exactly,” he said. “That’s the reason I’m not selling. You offering that much money only makes me wonder why you’re so desperate.”</p><p>For the first time, the leader’s smile faded.</p><p>He nodded slowly. “Fine,” he said. “If you refuse to sell, then we will take it by force. Without paying a single cent.”</p><p>His eyes hardened and added. “If Young Master Raphael comes here, consider yourself finished.”</p><p>Charles didn’t blink.</p><p>“Well,” he replied coldly, “tell him I will be waiting.”</p><p>The leader laughed bitterly. “You are really calling for death,” he said. </p><p>He turned sharply toward his men. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Groaning and clutching their injuries, they dragged themselves up. Still holding their weapons in shaking hands, they staggered toward the exit.</p><p>One by one, they limped out of the store.</p><p>Charles watched them leave, and sighed because he knew the gravity of what just happened.</p><p>The Trisian Syndicate would surely come back, and according to Mr. Noh, he was too weak and couldn&#x27;t take them. </p><p>But yet, he can&#x27;t just back down and do as they wish.</p><p>Charles watched them disappear, then let out a slow breath. He knew exactly how serious this was.</p><p>The Trisian Syndicate would come back. And according to Mr. Noh, he wasn’t strong enough to face them yet.</p><p>Still, bending down wasn’t an option.</p><p>He turned to Natasha. “Are you okay?”</p><p>She nodded quickly. “I’m fine. You should be the one being asked that.”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “I’m always fine.”</p><p>She gave a small, grateful smile. “Thanks for coming so fast.” Then her expression hardened. “Who were those animals? And who is the Trisian Syndicate? You reacted like you knew them.”</p><p>Charles hesitated for a second, then shrugged. “They are just an evil group I have heard about. Powerful. Ruthless.”</p><p> He didn’t go into details.</p><p>Natasha nodded slowly, then frowned. “But why would they want to buy my store for that much money? That so huge ”</p><p>Charles went quiet again. “That’s what bothers me,” he said. “One billion means there’s something here worth far more than that.”</p><p>She blinked. “What could that be? All I sell are normal gems and stones.”</p><p>Charles didn’t answer. His eyes shifted, focus sharpening.</p><p>[X-ray vision activated]</p><p>He swept the store. The walls. The floor. The shelves. Beneath the counters.</p><p>Yet, he saw nothing.</p><p>No hidden vault or  rare core and no abnormal energy.</p><p>He exhaled and shook his head. “I honestly don’t know.”</p><p>Natasha’s worry deepened. “They said they will come back. What should we do? Should I call the police?”</p><p>“They won’t help,” Charles said. “And they won’t dare touch this.”</p><p>He pulled out his phone and made two quick calls.</p><p>“Zander. Reaper,” he said calmly. “Bring your people here right now, will send the location. I need a store secured.”</p><p>He ended the calls.</p><p>It took barely five minutes after he sent the location. </p><p>Three black vans pulled up outside the store right after Charles sent the location. The doors slid open almost at once.</p><p>Zander and Reaper stepped out first, followed by their men. Batons in hand, faces hard. They moved fast, spreading out instinctively, then rushed toward Charles and stopped a few steps away.</p><p>They bowed and shouted.</p><p>“Boss!!”</p><p>Charles nodded. “Good. Secure the store. Keep watch outside and inside. Don’t disturb customers or scare them off. Stay at the surroundings”</p><p>“Yes, boss,” they answered in unison.</p><p>“Priority one,” Charles added, his tone firm. “Protect Natasha. If anything feels off, you call me immediately. Don’t hesitate.”</p><p>“Yes, boss.”</p><p>Natasha stared at them, clearly stunned. When they moved into position, she turned to Charles with an impressed smile. “How did you manage to make Zander and Reaper call you boss? Aren’t they famous street thugs?”</p><p>Charles just smiled it off. “Long story.”</p><p>They talked for a bit. Before leaving, Charles faced Zander again. “Remember. Anyone comes to cause trouble, you call me immediately.”</p><p>“Yes, boss!!!.”</p><p>Charles nodded, then turned to Natasha. “I will come back tomorrow to check on you.”</p><p>She smiled. “Thank you. For everything.”</p><p>He waved it off and left.</p><p>Minutes later, he was back at the hotel.</p><p>His mind was buzzing. He couldn’t wait to tell Lizzypie about what happened. She would be so shocked.</p><p>He pushed the door open and called out, “Lizzy!”.</p><p>He stood in the middle of the room.</p><p>“Lizzypie!” he called out again, excitement still in his voice. “You gotta hear this.”</p><p>But again, there was no response.</p><p>“Lizzy?”</p><p>He frowned his face. “Maybe she had slept off already”. </p><p>He walked toward her bedroom and pushed the door open. “Lizzy.”</p><p>But the room was empty as well, with no sight of lizzypie. </p><p></p></div>
