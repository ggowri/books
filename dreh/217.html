        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div><p>Charles arrived at Natasha’s store and slowed when he saw them.</p><p>Six men stood outside, spread casually across the front like they owned the street. Black suits and hard eyes.</p><p>As Charles stepped closer, one of them noticed him. A second later, they all did. Without a word, they parted, creating a clear path to the door.</p><p>He walked in.</p><p>Inside the shop,  Natasha sat behind the counter, stiff, her hands clasped together. In front of her sat a young man with slick, jelly-packed hair and an expensive jacket that screamed arrogance. He lounged on the chair like the place belonged to him.</p><p>The young man turned as the door closed.</p><p>He looked Charles over, slow and deliberate, then smiled.</p><p>“So,” he said lightly, “you must be the one who beat up my men.”</p><p>Charles didn’t stop walking. He moved until he stood right in front of him.</p><p>“If you keep disturbing her,” Charles said calmly, “I will do the same to you.”</p><p>For a second, the room was silent.</p><p>Then the young man burst out laughing.</p><p>He leaned back, clapping once. “You really think you can fight me?”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “I have fought monsters. I don’t give a fuck who you are.”</p><p>The smile didn’t leave the man’s face. He nodded, amused. “You are not the only one who’s fought a monster.”</p><p>Charles’ eyes hardened. “What do you want?”</p><p>The man spread his hands slightly. “I think you already know. I’m here to buy this place.”</p><p>Natasha stiffened.</p><p>“I’m willing to raise the price,” he continued casually. “One point two billion.”</p><p>Natasha’s eyes widened before she could stop herself. For a split second, shock flashed across her face. That amount was insane. </p><p>Charles&#x27; frowned upon hearing this. It only made his jaw tighten. It only made him more curious as to why they were willing to go this far. </p><p>He looked at Raphael. “We’re not interested.”</p><p>Raphael tilted his head. “You don’t have to be difficult. You should accept us while we’re being generous.”</p><p>Charles stepped closer, invading his space. His voice dropped. “Or what?”</p><p>Raphael leaned forward slightly, his confidence untouched. “Or we will keep coming here.”</p><p>He smiled, calm and certain.</p><p>“And we will later destroy everything and get it forcefully.”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “You must think very highly of yourself. But like I said, if you dare disturb her again, I will whoop your ass.”</p><p>Raphael chuckled and nodded. “I have heard about you. I was told you even killed Blade. If that’s what’s giving you confidence, then let me correct you. Blade was my lowest junior in cultivation.”</p><p>Charles stepped forward again, refusing to retreat. “I don’t care what you are. We are not selling this store. That’s the end of it.”</p><p>Raphael rose slowly from his chair. He glanced around the shop as if inspecting a toy, then looked back at Charles with clear amusement.</p><p>“I like your bravery,” he said. “And the way you are not afraid of the Trisian family. Most people would already be pissing themselves.”</p><p>He took a step closer. Then something unexpected happened.</p><p>Raphael’s body shuddered, and in the next instant, another Raphael stepped out of him, as if peeling away from the same body.</p><p>Charles’ throat tightened. He instinctively stepped back half a pace.</p><p>Natasha covered her mouth. “How… how is that possible?”</p><p>Before anyone could process it, the Raphaels split again. And again. And again.</p><p>One became two. Two became four. Four became six. Then ten.</p><p>They surrounded Charles in a perfect circle, each one identical, each one smiling.</p><p>Charles stood still, muscles tense, eyes moving rapidly. He could no longer tell which one was real.</p><p>So this was it. Peak-level power.</p><p>One of the Raphaels stepped forward. “Why don’t you join us?” he asked calmly. “Work for the Trisian family. We will pay you well.”</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly.</p><p>“I don’t want your money,” he said. “Or any shit that comes with it. Just leave this store. We’re not selling, and nothing will change that.”</p><p>The smiles faded.</p><p>The Raphaels began multiplying again, their presence pressing down like weight in the air.</p><p>One of them leaned in slightly.</p><p>“Do you know,” he said, “that right now, right here, I can kill you?”</p><p>Charles&#x27; shoulders relaxed, but his eyes sharpened. He scanned the circle slowly, counting distances, angles, exits. He was ready to take them.</p><p>Then one of them spoke.</p><p>“Why don’t we settle this with one-on-one combat?”</p><p>Charles’ gaze snapped to him. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>The Raphaels shifted, and the one closest to him stepped forward. His tone was calm, almost playful.</p><p>“You said you would whoop my ass,” Raphael said. “So let’s make it fair. One on one. If I win, you sell this shop. No arguments.”</p><p>Charles’ jaw tightened.</p><p>“And if I win?” he asked.</p><p>Raphael smiled. “Then I will never disturb you or this place again.”</p><p>Charles frowned.</p><p>It didn’t sit right.</p><p>Raphael had just demonstrated power far beyond anything he’d faced recently. </p><p>Splitting into ten bodies like it was nothing. On top of that, the bet was lopsided. If Charles lost, Natasha lost everything. If Raphael lost, he only walked away.</p><p>Raphael saw the hesitation and laughed softly.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” he asked. “Are you chickening out now? Don’t tell me you’re afraid.”</p><p>Natasha turned sharply. “Charles—”</p><p>He raised a hand slightly, stopping her.</p><p>Charles exhaled. He didn’t like being cornered. He liked it even less when someone thought fear would make him bend.</p><p>He lifted his head and looked Raphael straight in the eyes.</p><p>“Yeah,” he said evenly. “Why don’t we do that. One on one combat.”</p><p></p></div>
