        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div>Charles felt struck...like he’d been lifted and slammed against a wall by what he had just heard.<br/>He had devoted himself to her, to her Buddhism, to her strict rules. But now it was clear… none of it had ever been true. She just didn’t want him.<br/>“That’s it. Go to your room,” Tracy said coldly.<br/>Charles swallowed hard, his chest tightening. “Okay… maybe you feel empathy for the child. I can take that. But I just don’t want to see you with that man again. You should respect me.”<br/>Tracy barely looked at him. “No way. I will still be seeing him. Francis will want to be with him sometimes. Just live with it… it’s nothing.” With that, she turned and walked to her own room.<br/>They slept in separate rooms… always had. And Charles respected her private life and everything, like a gentleman.<br/>Charles lay in bed, his heart restless, his body heavy. He couldn't sleep. Then he heard faint giggling from her room...a soft laugh, warm and light, the kind he had never heard from her...not once in their marriage. She was probably on the phone with Derek.<br/>He couldn’t sleep thinking about her explanation. He knew that she was doing all this because he was poor. All these years of marriage, all his devotion… and this was what he got.<br/>---<br/>The next morning, Charles woke to a noise. He dragged himself out of bed and stood frozen in the doorway.<br/>Tracy was unpacking a boy’s luggage. Her face was glowing, alive with joy. She laughed and played with the child, who didn’t even acknowledge Charles’s presence.<br/>Charles stared, speechless. Even on their wedding day, Tracy hadn’t smiled like that. She’d been cold-faced, unreadable. For years, he had thought maybe that was just her natural expression. But no. She was only cold with him.<br/>After unpacking, Tracy held the boy’s small hand and said sweetly, “Come, let’s go bathe.” Without sparing Charles a glance, she led the boy into her room… like Charles was air, invisible in his own house.<br/>Charles pressed his fists against his thighs, trembling. He tried to convince himself he could live with this.<br/>“Haaa!” he could hear the boy cry.<br/>Panic surged in his chest. Tracy had never cared for a child before, and was probably clueless… What if she slipped? What if something happened? His heart raced, and without thinking, he rushed into the room.<br/>“Are you okay...?” he began, but the words died in his throat.<br/>The scene before him nearly drove him insane.<br/>Inside the room stood Derek Wilson… shirtless...cradling the crying boy against his chest. He cooed softly, soothing him, Tracy stood nearby, wrapped in a bathrobe that barely reached the curves of her full thighs. She was smiling tenderly at the pair, her hand brushing Derek’s arm.<br/>It was a picture-perfect family...warm, whole, radiant. But in Charles’s own house. With his own wife. And he… was the stranger.<br/>It felt like the wind itself was trying to carry him away, like his body was dissolving, leaving nothing behind but a hollow ache.<br/>“Why can't you knock? Is your brain as poor as you?” Tracy hollered.<br/>He couldn’t help but scoff. “What… What the hell is happening here? Wait, what is this man doing here?”<br/>That’s when Charles realized the man had been in the room all night. That’s the reason Tracy was giggling all night. What kind of disrespect is this!?<br/>Derek was shocked to see him. He sprang up. “Oh… Mr. Charles, good morning. Please, I’m sorry, so sorry, and don’t misunderstand the situation. I dropped him last night, but he wouldn’t let me leave. You know how naughty children can be, so I had to stay,” he said, giggling.<br/>God! I felt like I should knock all his teeth out. What kind of excuse was that? He was still shirtless.<br/>Tracy wouldn’t let me sleep in her room all night, even on the so-called fifteenth...she would send me out after we had done it. But… but this man spent the night?<br/>Charles’s heart cracked. The unfairness was suffocating.<br/>Tracy waved dismissively, as if he were the intruder. “Please, Charles, just leave. We are busy here. And next time, knock.”<br/>Her tone was casual, detached...like it was his fault.<br/>Charles blinked at her, trembling, pointing at himself, as if to confirm he had heard right. “Leave? You’re asking me to leave? This is my house.”<br/>“Yes. Please leave,” Tracy repeated coldly.<br/>Something inside him shattered. His lips quivered, his voice breaking. He knew this marriage was primarily over. She was clearly cheating, and still bringing it under his nose.<br/>“Then… let’s get a divorce.”<br/>The words stunned even him. In five years of marriage, Charles had never once raised his voice at her. Never insulted her. Never threatened her. And yet here he was, finally saying the one word he thought would never pass his lips.<br/>Tracy’s face flickered with surprise. For the first time, she seemed caught off guard. But it lasted only a moment before she scoffed, her expression sharpening into disdain.<br/>“Divorce? Over something this small? No...I won’t accept that,” she sneered at him.<br/>Charles gaped at her, disbelief flooding him. It didn’t make sense. He could see the truth, plain as day, the condom...her closeness with Derek, the tenderness she never gave him. To him, the marriage was already over. But somehow, she was still clinging to it. Maybe this was a misunderstanding.<br/>“Why?” he muttered, more to himself than to her.<br/>Tracy’s lips curled into a faint, almost amused smile. “I am practicing a higher devotion in Buddhism. I don’t need distractions right now. After I have finished my practice… then we can divorce.”<br/>Charles let out a hollow laugh. He called himself stupid for what he just assumed. He had always been second in her lifestyle. Even with divorce, he still came second...regardless of how he mattered to her.<br/>Then Derek chimed in, “Tracy, Mr. Charles. I don’t want my problem and my kid to cause the reason that will ruin your marriage. I am selfish and stupid. I should have thought about this before coming here. I will leave now. Francis, let’s go home,” he said, his tone full of sadness and pity, as he started dressing.<br/>Well, maybe Derek is more sensible than Tracy. This is his house, and they should leave! Five years of marriage...He shouldn't let them spoil it. He stood by, waiting for them to leave.<br/>Tracy unbelievably stopped them. “Derek. What are you thinking? We have talked about this, and Francis is already here. This has nothing to do with you or your kid. If someone has to leave, it has to be him!”.</div>
