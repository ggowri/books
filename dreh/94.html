        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div><p>With the Soul Sight, Charles immediately looked five seconds into the future and knew what Mr. Jim would do if he charged at him.</p><p> &quot;Gotcha,&quot; he smirked, then lunged.</p><p>Sir Jim tried to dodge, but Charles already knew he would. He switched his punch midair and hit Mr. Jim square in the face.</p><p><strong>THWAK.</strong></p><p>Mr. Jim staggered back, then charged again, but Charles slipped past it easily and kicked him in the jaw. Mr. Jim crashed to the floor hard.</p><p>That made him furious, while Steven recoiled.</p><p><em>[Soul Sight exhausted. Soul Sight should not be used again for five hours until cooldown is complete.]</em></p><p>Charles stepped back, breathing hard. The power has been exhausted.</p><p>But Mr. Jim, still burning with anger, came at him again. Charles had no choice but to reactivate the Soul Sight.</p><p>He used it to knock Mr. Jim down, even fracturing his backbone.</p><p>Natasha clapped in relief while Steven’s jaw dropped in shock.</p><p>The victory didn’t last long. Everything blurred in Charles’s eyes. His head throbbed.</p><p>As Mr. Jim struggled up for another attack, Charles collapsed and fainted.</p><p>He had overused the power.</p><p>Natasha rushed at him and screamed, “Charles!, Charles” She reached him and shook him, but he did not move. Her knees gave out. </p><p>Mr. Jim blinked, surprised. He didn&#x27;t even do anything. </p><p>Steven laughed. “Look at him. Mr. Jim beat him to a pulp till he fainted. Mr. Jim  didn’t want to kill him. That is why he held back and let him just have a small moment.”</p><p>Natasha cried out, “Steven, just leave please”.</p><p>He retorted,  “You are the one that should leave  this place now and sign the store to me. Or else, I will have Mr. Jim finish him”</p><p>Natasha blinked awake and clutched Charles. Tears fell down her face. “Please,” she whispered. “Let me take him to the hospital. I will sign the papers tomorrow. The file is not here.”</p><p>Steven’s smile went cold. “Sister, don&#x27;t play me” He leaned close. “Either you sign now or I order Mr. Jim to finish him.”</p><p>“Are you dumb! I said, &quot;It&#x27;s not here.” Natasha yelled. “Next tomorrow. I promise.”</p><p>Steven looked at Mr. Jim. Mr. Jim shrugged and smiled.</p><p>“In 2 days,” Steven said. “You better keep that promise. Or else I will kill your lover. I swear.”</p><p>Natasha nodded hard. They left without another word. Natasha stayed on the floor holding Charles. Steven walked out with Mr. Jim at his side, victory written across his face.</p><p>××××</p><p>Charles groaned. His head throbbed as he held it, forcing his eyes open. At first, everything was a blur. Then shapes formed — white walls, a faint beeping sound, the smell of antiseptic.</p><p>“Good, you are alive,” a voice echoed beside him.</p><p>He turned and saw Lizzypie. He was in a hospital bed.</p><p>“What… what am I doing here?” he asked weakly.</p><p>Lizzypie crossed her arms. “Did you lose your brain too? You fainted. Natasha used your phone to call me. I heard you had a fight with someone.”</p><p>Charles groaned again and sat up slowly. The memory hit him — Mr. Jim’s punch, the Soul Sight, the sudden blackout. His stomach twisted in shame. “Damn,” he muttered. “I actually fainted.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Lizzypie said dryly. “Really damn. I told you not to overuse that power. Now look at you. Couldn’t you use your X-ray vision to fight instead of the Soul Sight?”</p><p>Charles then told her everything that happened. How the man weaved and over-powered him when he used the level 1 and 2 power.</p><p>He had to resort to  level 3, Soul sight, to have some upper hand. </p><p>“That man was faster than me,”He added.</p><p>Lizzypie leaned closer, her voice low. “Charles, listen. Your Level One and Two abilities are supernatural. Ordinary people can’t even react when you use them. If that man could dodge and overpower you while you were using both, then he’s not ordinary.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “You mean… he has power too?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yeah. He’s got something. Maybe not the same as yours, but definitely not human-level strength.”</p><p>Charles let out a long sigh and stared at the ceiling. “So how am I supposed to defeat him then?”</p><p>“Maybe start by not dying,” Lizzypie said flatly. “You need to rest, recover, and train. When you can hold the Soul Sight longer, then think about fighting him again.”</p><p>Charles groaned, gripping the edge of the bed. “I can’t wait that long. Even the upgrade stone at Natasha’s place has vanished, replaced with empty ones. Her brother, the one Mr. Jim works for, replaced every stone in her store with empty ones. I couldn’t find a single real piece.”</p><p>His jaw tightened. “I have to beat this man soon. He’s making Natasha’s life hell.”</p><p>Lizzypie smirked,  seeing she was determined,  she decided to offer a solution. “Then you will have to look somewhere else for the stone” She paused, eyes narrowing. “Aside from Norman, the only people who also sell real stones now are the Titan family.”</p></div>
