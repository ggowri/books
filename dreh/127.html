        <h1>chapter 127</h1>
        <div>Charles stayed calm and took a slow step forward.<br/>“Norman, what the hell are you doing?”<br/>Norman pressed the knife harder against Lizzypie’s neck. “What does it look like? Don’t play stupid. One wrong move and you’ll watch your little whore bleed out.”<br/>Charles’ jaw tightened. “She’s not a whore. Say that again and I will kill you myself.”<br/>Norman scoffed. “You are crazy. Out of everything happening right now, that’s what you care about?”<br/>He tilted his head. “Whatever. Let’s get to business.”<br/>Charles kept his eyes locked on him. “What do you want?”<br/>“I want you to not act rashly,” Norman said. “And to walk inside slowly. No tricks. No sudden moves.”<br/>Charles lifted both hands, palms out. “Fine. I’m coming in.”<br/>He stepped forward carefully.<br/>Norman’s eyes narrowed. “Good,” he said quietly. “ slowly… slowly”<br/>Charles was doing that, then a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. <br/>[Eyes of Satan activated]<br/>He used his flash power to rushed at Norman. But  Norman was already prepared. <br/>Powww!<br/>Norman’s hand snapped out and threw something straight at Charles’ face.<br/>A cloud of grey powder burst across Charles’ eyes and nose.<br/>He stumbled back. “What… what is that?”<br/>His vision immediately blurred. His knees instantly weakened. <br/>Norman stepped aside, covering his own nose with a cloth and smirking.<br/>“Gotcha.”<br/>Charles tried to stay upright, but the dizziness hit hard as his legs gave out.<br/>Thud!!!<br/>He collapsed to the ground, the room spinning around him.<br/>His last sight before blacking out was Lizzypie thrashing in the chair, muffled screams behind the tape… and Norman walking toward him with cold satisfaction.<br/>A few minutes later…<br/>Charles’ head throbbed like someone was hammering it from the inside.  <br/>A low buzz filled his ears. He groaned, shook his head hard, and forced his eyes open.<br/>Everything was a blurry mess at first,Then it slowly sharpened.<br/>He was sitting on a cold steel chair, arms wrenched behind his back, thick rope cutting into his wrists and ankles.   Two yards in front of him was Lizzypie, tied the same way, her mouth still taped.<br/>Norman stood behind her, the knife now resting lazily against her throat again.<br/>Charles lifted his head.<br/>Norman grinned. “Welcome back, hero.”<br/>Charles’ voice came out rough. “What… What did you do to me?”<br/>“That?” Norman shrugged. “Isoflurizine-X. Military-grade tranquilizer. One pinch can drop an elephant in a second. You are welcome I didn't slit your throat while you were sleeping.”<br/>Charles glared, veins popping in his neck. “What the fuck do you want? Touch her and I swear I will rip you apart.”<br/>Norman’s smile grew wider. He slid the knife away… and slipped his free hand straight under Lizzypie’s tight top. His palm closed over her big, soft breast and squeezed hard.<br/>Lizzypie jerked against the ropes, muffled screams coming through the tape.<br/>Norman groaned like a pervert. “Fuck… I’ve dreamed about these tits for weeks. So heavy, and perfect.”<br/>Charles roared, straining so hard the steel chair creaked. “Get your fucking hand off her! or else, I will break every bone in your body!”<br/>Norman just laughed, kneading her breast openly, playing with her nipple. <br/>“Wow, I'm getting harder, I feel like I should place my dick between them.”<br/>He gave one last rough squeeze, then pulled his hand out, brought his fingers to his nose and inhaled deeply.<br/>“Mmm. Smells sweet. You are one lucky bastard, Charles.”<br/>Lizzypie spat fire with her eyes, breathing hard through her nose.<br/>“I swear I will break that hand”. Charles vowed. <br/>Norman turned fully to Charles now, wiping his hand on his pants like he owned her.<br/>“It seems you keep forgetting I'm the one in control,” he said, voice suddenly ice-cold. “Let's make this simple. You want this pretty woman to keep breathing? Give me the Nytheris Stone. Right now. No games.”<br/>Charles frowned, Norman was doing this because of that Nytheris stone. The one he already dissolved to save Mr. Vasilios’s son. <br/>Charles said, “You are doing all this because of a stone I don’t even have anymore?”<br/>Norman’s eyes twitched. “Don’t bullshit me. You have no idea how much damage you caused to my life. Every time we meet you humiliate me. Every damn time.”<br/>Charles growled, “That’s because you keep confronting me unnecessarily.”<br/>Norman snapped, voice shaking with frustration. “And now my father removed me as his heir! He doesn’t want to see me! The only way I can fix this is to give him the Nytheris Stone.”<br/>He stepped closer, knife gleaming near Lizzypie’s neck.<br/>“So you better hand it over,” Norman hissed. “Or else…”<br/>He let the implication hang in the air.<br/>Charles struggled against the ropes. “I told you, I don’t have it anymore.”<br/>Norman’s face twisted in anger. “You are joking with me. Seems like you don’t care if she dies.”<br/>He ripped the tape off Lizzypie’s mouth, making her gasp sharply.<br/>Then he walked to Charles and pressed the knife under his chin, grabbing his jaw.<br/>Norman whispered dangerously, “Maybe she has it. You better tell me where it is. I’ll count to three.”<br/>Lizzypie glared at him. “He already told you he doesn’t have it. Are you that stupid?”<br/>Norman snapped toward her. “Did you sell it? Where did it go? Just tell me!”<br/>“It’s gone,” Lizzypie said coldly. “We broke it into pieces and used it for medicine. It doesn’t exist anymore.”<br/>“Bullshit!” Norman shouted. “Do you two think I’m an idiot?! How will you use stone for medicine ”<br/>He pointed the knife between both of them, breathing hard, losing patience.<br/>“I will count down to three,” he said slowly, voice dark. “Tell me where the Nytheris Stone is… or I swear i will kill you and i will get to fuck that bitch without any disturbance”<br/>Charles clenched his jaw. He was already ripping the rope off. little by little.<br/>Lizzypie stared death directly in the eyes while Norman raised the knife higher.<br/>“One…”<br/>“Two…”.<br/>Thud!!!.<br/>He didn't finish before someone smacked with a fry pan on his head. </div>
