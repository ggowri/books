        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div><p>Charles was slightly amused.</p><p>The way Mr. Belly said twenty billion like it was pocket change told him everything.</p><p>This man wasn’t just rich. He was strikingly rich.</p><p>The kind of wealth that could build empires… and also build monsters like the Trisian family.</p><p>Mr. Belly nodded. “I will even give you a bonus.”</p><p>Charles didn’t react much. The money was insane, but that wasn’t what pulled his attention. It was the scale of power behind it.</p><p>He kept his face calm and said, “So you want me to tail Raphael until I find evidence that proves they’re deceiving you.”</p><p>Mr. Belly answered immediately. “Yes.”</p><p>Charles nodded. “And what if I don’t see anything?”</p><p>Mr. Belly’s expression didn’t change. “You will.”</p><p>His voice was firm.</p><p>“I am sure.”</p><p>Then he added, “But this is only a thirty-day job. Thirty days. If there’s anything hidden, it will show.”</p><p>Charles scoffed lightly and nodded. “Alright. I will do it.”</p><p>Mr. Belly’s face lit up. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Charles said simply. “I will.”</p><p>Mr. Belly quickly said, “I will pay half now—”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “No. We will  talk about payment after I find something.”</p><p>Mr. Belly froze, genuinely surprised. Then his eyes softened.</p><p>“I’m… truly grateful,” he said. “Thank you so much.”</p><p>They exchanged contacts.</p><p>Charles told him he would inform him if anything came up. And with that, they split.</p><p>×××</p><p>After Charles reached home, he told Lizzypie everything.</p><p>Even she looked genuinely surprised that the Trisian was living under Mr. Belly. </p><p>Lizzypie exhaled. “If you find anything, the Trisian family will crumble financially. They only look big because they have money to maintain that image. Without it, they fall.”</p><p>Charles agreed. “Yeah.”</p><p>Then he added, still a little shocked, “That man said billions like it was nothing.”</p><p>Lizzypie shook her head. “I wonder how Mr. Belly even amassed that kind of wealth.”</p><p>Charles leaned back. “The issue now is how to do the tailing without being caught. Raphael is a high-level Cultivator. He might notice me.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded. “You’ll have to get close to get anything useful. That’s the dangerous part.”</p><p>She paused and added. “I will  do more digging to look for ways”</p><p>Charles scoffed lightly. “That’s why I love you.”</p><p>Lizzypie waved it off. “Nothing for you tonight, no matter how you flatter me.”</p><p>She already knew where his mind was going. Charles only smiled. The mission failed.</p><p>The next day, in the afternoon, Lizzypie came back with results.</p><p>Raphael had a pattern. He always went to a high-level bar in the city. Lizzypie checked the surrounding CCTV footage.</p><p>“He visits there every day,” she told Charles. “Every single day”</p><p>Charles’ eyes sharpened. “Then we might get something.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded once. “Yeah… so let&#x27;s get started”.</p><p>Charles was about to speak when a knock came at the door.</p><p>He paused.</p><p>“Uh… are we expecting someone?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Charles frowned, still confused, and walked over to open it.</p><p>The door swung open to find Sapphire standing there.</p><p>She smiled brightly. “Hi, Charles.”</p><p>She looked even more striking than before. Her figure was sharp, confident, almost distracting.</p><p>Charles’ eyes lingered on her sexy hip, legs, tight to her big breast. Sapphire was truly endowed.</p><p>Sapphire raised an eyebrow, amused. “Instead of staring,” she teased, “you can just grab it. I won&#x27;t mind”</p><p>Charles snapped back to himself. “Uh… wow. Sapphire.”</p><p>He stepped aside and let her in.  “Sorry”.</p><p>Sapphire scoffed, “You shouldn&#x27;t be, it all belongs to you”.</p><p>Charles gulped hearing this.  He then  asked carefully, “Why… are you here?”</p><p>Lizzypie answered instead.</p><p>“I called her.”</p><p> “She’s helping us with this mission. She will be the one to find a way to get close to Raphael.”</p><p>Sapphire smiled. </p><p>Lizzypie added bluntly, “Even if she has to throw herself at him.”</p><p>Charles’ eyes widened. “What?!”</p><p>Charles’ voice rose instantly.</p><p>“What are you saying? Get close to Raphael?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded like it was obvious. “Yes. We need someone who can get near him without suspicion.”</p><p>Charles sneered. “Near him for what?”</p><p>“To tap him,” Lizzypie said simply. “To hear what he says, who he meets, what he’s planning. Only Sapphire can help us do that.”</p><p>Charles’ jaw tightened.</p><p>“You know how dangerous Raphael is,” he snapped. “What if he finds out?”</p><p>Sapphire smiled, calm and steady. “Actually, we already talked about this. I’m willing to help. I can do it.”</p><p>Charles shook his head immediately.</p><p>“No,” he said firmly. “You can’t.”</p><p></p></div>
