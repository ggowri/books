        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles remained calm and said, &ldquo;Instead of shouting, why don&rsquo;t you save your energy and actually check the document.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins sneered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to check your bullshit. Father said he would make it official but couldn&rsquo;t before he died. Now you just show up claiming you have some fake document.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald had already snatched the papers and was scanning through them, his brows tightening with every line. The document was detailed, formal, and the signature at the bottom was unmistakably Mr. Moretti&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is this,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>Allison grabbed the file from him and read through it as well. Her eyes widened slightly before she passed it along.&nbsp;</p><p>One by one, the document moved through the room until it reached Collins. He frowned deeply as he read it, then turned and handed it to Tracy.</p><p>&ldquo;Check this,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Confirm its authenticity.&rdquo;</p><p>Tracy examined it carefully. After a moment, she spoke, measured and cautious. &ldquo;It&hellip; looks original,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t fully assure it.&rdquo;</p><p>She knew it was real. She just didn&rsquo;t want to say it outright.</p><p>Serena also stood up to check it, she was surprised as well. She never thought her father wrote the document.</p><p>Mr. Gerald slammed his palm on the table. &ldquo;Nonsense. All of this is nonsense. How did this even get into your hands?&rdquo; He glared at Charles. &ldquo;My brother drafted something and gave it to you, of all people? You expect us to believe that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool us,&rdquo; he snapped.</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;First of all, the only people fooling themselves here are all of you. How do you even hold a meeting like this, appointing positions without consulting the board?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The company is owned by the Moretti family,&rdquo; Mr. Gerald shot back. &ldquo;The board follows our instructions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how it works,&rdquo; Serena added firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fucking care,&rdquo; Mr. Gerald replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not believing that fabricated document.&rdquo;</p><p>Allison nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. It makes no sense.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins folded his arms. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool us with just a piece of paper.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles said calmly, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not just a piece of paper.&rdquo;</p><p>Just then, the door chimed open and an old man walked in.</p><p>The room went dead silent.</p><p>It was Mr. Valentino, the director of the board.</p><p>Beside him stood a younger man everyone recognized immediately&mdash;Jimmy, Mr. Moretti&rsquo;s personal lawyer.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Mr. Valentino wasn&rsquo;t just respected. He owned a major share of Moretti Enterprises, and many shareholders stayed loyal to the company because of him. If he pulled out, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a setback&mdash;it would be a disaster.</p><p>Mr. Valentino didn&rsquo;t sit.</p><p>&ldquo;Moretti was like a brother to me,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;My closest friend and he died a horrible death under this roof, where one of you might very well be the culprit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you are already appointing positions without consulting the board.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;What a disappointment.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald straightened. &ldquo;Sir, with due respect, the family must move forward. And it is only right that Collins becomes the CEO.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Valentino looked at him. &ldquo;Who gave you that right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Mr. Gerald replied firmly. &ldquo;As the next elder of the family.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Valentino scoffed. &ldquo;You should know better. If we, the board leaders, refuse him, he won&rsquo;t become CEO.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald&rsquo;s expression hardened. &ldquo;Oh, he will. The worst you can do is withdraw. The Moretti family is already powerful. We&rsquo;ll attract new loyal shareholders.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Valentino stared at him for a long second, then laughed quietly. &ldquo;Do you even understand business?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned slightly and continued, his voice steady and authoritative. &ldquo;For anyone to become CEO, they must possess the Pandora Box.&rdquo;</p><p>The room stirred as everyone looked lost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The Pandora Box contains everything,&rdquo; Mr. Valentino explained. &ldquo;All employee records. Shareholder data. Company databases. Contracts. Financial access. Every major operation runs through it.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused.</p><p>&ldquo;And most importantly, any financial transaction&mdash;any movement of funds&mdash;requires approval through the Pandora Box. Without it, no money can be accessed. Not a single account.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked directly at Mr. Gerald.</p><p>&ldquo;So tell me,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;Do you have the Pandora Box?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald&rsquo;s confidence drained from his face as he stood there, suddenly looking like a fool.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t thought about that at all.</p><p>Mr. Gerald had believed that once he announced Collins as CEO, everything would simply fall into place, access granted automatically.</p><p>&nbsp;And honestly, that might have worked&mdash;if Charles hadn&rsquo;t produced a written document naming the next CEO.</p><p>But he had.</p><p>Collins turned sharply toward him, panic slipping into his voice. &ldquo;Say something! Do you have it&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald sighed, trying to recover and didn't want to accept defeat, &ldquo;Well&hellip; we will obtain it after Collins becomes the CEO. That&rsquo;s how it works, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Before anyone else could respond, Jimmy finally spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p><p>Every head turned.</p><p>&ldquo;Because Mr. Moretti already signed a documented directive appointing Serena as CEO,&rdquo; Jimmy continued. &ldquo;She is the only officially recognized successor.&rdquo;</p><p>He glanced at the document in Charles&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;That document is original.&rdquo;</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>&ldquo;And that means,&rdquo; Jimmy added, &ldquo;only Serena can obtain the Pandora Box. Therefore, Serena Moretti is the rightful CEO.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins and Mr. Gerald couldn't believe how this was turning out, if Serena becomes the CEO, It's basically over for them.</p></div>
