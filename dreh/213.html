        <h1>Chapter 213</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone reacted to what Serena said as they turned at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Gerald&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;Serena,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;what did you just say?&rdquo;</p><p>Serena scoffed. &ldquo;I said, are you being a clown right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald slammed his palm on the table. &ldquo;Watch your mouth. I am the elder of this family.&rdquo;</p><p>Serena laughed coldly. &ldquo;Elder my ass. And who appointed you for that role?&rdquo; Her voice rose, controlled but cutting.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;First, you rushed my father&rsquo;s body into burial while the investigation was still ongoing. Then you let Collins&mdash;who was disowned&mdash;walk back into this house like nothing happened. And now you are handing him the CEO position. If that isn&rsquo;t clown behavior, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Watch your mouth, Serena,&rdquo; Mr. Gerald snapped.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Your father is gone. We can&rsquo;t halt the family&rsquo;s affairs. As the next elder, it is my right to take charge. And Collins is the first son. It makes sense for him to be CEO.&rdquo;</p><p>Allison scoffed loudly. &ldquo;Oh, so now you care?&rdquo; she cut in. &ldquo;Since the day Father died, you haven't shed a single tear. You didn&rsquo;t even act like you cared. Now that the CEO position is on the table, suddenly you are all righteous?&rdquo;</p><p>Serena turned to her, eyes blazing. &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think we have a bigger issue right now?&rdquo;</p><p>She swept her gaze across the room, meeting every face.</p><p>&ldquo;Our father was murdered under this roof,&rdquo; she said firmly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The killer might be sitting right here among us. And instead of finding out who did it,&nbsp; we are busy dividing power.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald waved a dismissive hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the police are for. They will find the truth sooner or later. Our focus should be on moving this family&rsquo;s affairs forward.&rdquo;</p><p>Serena nodded slowly, disbelief written all over her face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins finally spoke, his voice calm but edged with entitlement. &ldquo;We are all affected by Father&rsquo;s death. As a righteous son, it&rsquo;s only right that I return home and do my part. Why do you have a problem with that?&rdquo;</p><p>Serena swallowed, then lifted her head, her voice steady as she finally said what she had been holding back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If we are talking about moving this family forward, then I should be the CEO. And the head of the family.&rdquo;</p><p>The room stirred.</p><p>&ldquo;My father already appointed me,&rdquo; Serena continued. &ldquo;He made it clear.&rdquo;</p><p>Whispers broke out immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s what she cares about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unbelievable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How does she think she can rule over us?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald scoffed. &ldquo;That was before my brother died. Things have changed.&rdquo;</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s eyes hardened. &ldquo;How have things changed?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked around the room, one face after another. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but feel one of you killed Father for this nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>The murmurs grew louder.</p><p>&ldquo;What is she saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she accusing us now?&rdquo;</p><p>Allison folded her arms and said sharply, &ldquo;If we are going down that road, then you are the prime suspect. That&rsquo;s why you are angry. Things didn&rsquo;t go your way.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Exactly. Father announces her as CEO, and suddenly he&rsquo;s dead. Maybe she thought killing him would secure her position so she could rule however she wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>The room went quiet, eyes slowly turning back to Serena as the accusation settled in the air.</p><p>Serena gulped and slowly nodded, her hands clenched at her sides not knowing what to say.</p><p>Mr. Gerald straightened and spoke firmly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not throw accusations around. My decision is final. I will be the head of the family, and Collins will be the CEO of the family business.&rdquo;</p><p>Then a voice resonated clearly through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; no. You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone turned as Charles stepped into the grand room.</p><p>Murmurs erupted instantly.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is he doing!&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;That trash doesn't have any say in this family&rdquo;.</p><p>Mr. Gerald scoffed. &ldquo;Who do you think you are? You are not part of this family. You have no say here. Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins sneered. &ldquo;You think you can just barge in and speak nonsense? This is a Moretti house meeting. Exclusively for the Moretti family.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t flinch. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t shut up,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Not when it involves my fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is supposed to be the CEO,&rdquo; Charles continued evenly, &ldquo;as Mr. Moretti stated before he died.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Gerald slammed his hand on the table. &ldquo;He is dead. An announcement means nothing unless it was documented. And it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;Who told you it wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>He reached into his coat, pulled out a folded document, and held it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Moretti&rsquo;s signed document appointing Serena as the CEO and the head of the family.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone tensed up.</p><p>Even Serena froze, her eyes locked on the document in Charles&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Mr. Gerald&rsquo;s face tightened as Charles calmly stepped forward and spread the file on the table in front of him.</p><p>Collins shot to his feet, fury flashing across his face. &ldquo;What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Fabricating documents?&rdquo;</p><p>He pointed at Charles aggressively. &ldquo;Get out now before we have you arrested!&rdquo;</p></div>
