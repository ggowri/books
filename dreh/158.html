        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div><p>After a few minutes, Charles arrived at Natasha’s store. The bell above the door chimed softly.</p><p>Natasha looked up and smiled the moment she saw him. “You are here.”</p><p>She immediately pulled out a chair. “Sit. I will get you coffee.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Charles said, but she was already moving.</p><p>She returned quickly and placed the cup in front of him. “So, boss,” she said lightly, “what else do you need before I start?”</p><p>He scoffed at her calling him that. “Boss?”</p><p>She smiled. “Yeah. You are my boss. This store is still breathing because of you. Your shares are what’s holding it up.”</p><p>Charles looked at her without responding. He stared at her. She looked so damn pretty today. Sharp eyes. Perfect posture. That calm Asian elegance that always stood out. But she also wore an off-shoulder top and a very short skirt. He immediately shrugged it off.</p><p>“You sounded serious on the phone,” he said. “What did you find?”</p><p>Natasha’s smile faded. She sat beside him and reached into her bag. “This.”</p><p>She pulled out a photograph.</p><p>It was old. Crisp on every edge.</p><p>Five people stood in the picture. Four men. One woman.</p><p>Charles leaned forward. His breath caught as his eyes settled on the picture.</p><p>“That’s my father,” he said slowly.</p><p>Natasha nodded. “I know.”</p><p>“And that woman…” His voice dropped. “That’s my mother.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>He looked up at her sharply. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>“My brother and I were going through my father’s old belongings,” Natasha said. “We were looking for anything useful for the investigation. That’s when we found it.”</p><p>Charles stared at the photo again. “So your father knew mine.”</p><p>“That’s not even the shocking part,” Natasha said quietly.</p><p>She pointed at one of the men. “That’s my father.”</p><p>Charles nodded. He could see the resemblance.</p><p>Then she pointed at another man.</p><p>He squinted. “Wait. That’s—”</p><p>She nodded. “Mr. Moretti. Serena’s father.”</p><p>His chest tightened. “What?”</p><p>“That means they all knew each other,” Natasha said. “My father. Your father. Serena’s father.”</p><p>Charles swallowed hard. “Then they were friends.”</p><p>“There’s one more,” Natasha said.</p><p>She pointed at the last man. Charles leaned closer. His eyes traced the face slowly.</p><p>“No way,” he muttered.</p><p> “That’s Mr. Damien, from Winchester.”</p><p>Natasha nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Charles swallowed.</p><p>Only hours ago, the Godfather had given him a mission: kill Mr. Damien. He had assumed it was simple hatred or justice. Damien was rotten. Powerful. Untouchable.</p><p>But now he was staring at proof that Damien had once stood beside his parents. Close enough to smile for a photograph. That meant there was more to this. Much more.</p><p>“You know Mr. Damien?” Natasha asked, studying his face.</p><p>Charles nodded once. “Yeah.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>He didn’t answer.</p><p>She didn’t push either. Instead, she leaned closer and pointed at the background of the photo. “Look at this.”</p><p>He followed her finger. Behind them was a building. On the wall was a symbol—a pentagon shape painted blue.</p><p>“What’s that?” Charles asked.</p><p>Natasha reached into her bag again and pulled out more photos. Different angles. Different days. Same people and the same logo.</p><p>“It appears in all of them,” she said. “Every picture they took together.”</p><p>Charles’ jaw tightened. “So they were colleagues.”</p><p>“More than that,” Natasha replied. “They seemed like they were working on something together. Your parents. My father. Mr. Moretti. Mr. Damien.”</p><p>She paused. “This looks like an organization.”</p><p>Charles let out a low, dark chuckle. This was getting dark.</p><p>“That’s all I could find for now,” Natasha said. “But I will keep digging.”</p><p>He looked at her, sincerely grateful. “Thank you. Really.”</p><p>“Take the photos,” she said quickly. “You might need them.” She packed them carefully and handed them to him.</p><p>Charles nodded. “I appreciate everything you are doing. Thanks so much.”</p><p>Charles stared at the picture. Mr. Moretti knew his father, same as Mr. Damien. Then, they must know something—that was the reason when Mr. Damien of Moretti (Serena&#x27;s uncle, different from Damien of Winchester) was dying, he said Charles was with the wrong woman, which meant Serena. He felt like confronting Mr. Moretti and demanded what happened.</p><p>He turned to leave, then stopped.</p><p>He remembered he hadn’t finished leveling up Soul of Sight. And he had to face Mr. Damien of Winchester soon.</p><p>He turned back. “Natasha.”</p><p>“Yes, boss?”</p><p>He exhaled. “Do you have any premium stones I can cut?”</p><p>She smiled instantly. “Of course. Every stone here is yours.”</p><p>Natasha laughed softly and guided him toward a side section of the store where raw stones were arranged under glass.</p><p>Charles paused and used his X-ray eyes to search through every stone.</p><p>“There,” he said, reaching for it. “That one.”</p><p>Natasha raised a brow. “You didn’t even hesitate. You know what’s inside?”</p><p>“It has a ruby core,” Charles said calmly. “Clean. High grade.”</p><p>She whistled. “I wonder how you are able to do that.”</p><p>He turned the stone in his hand. “How much?”</p><p>Natasha scoffed. “I already said it. Everything here is yours. No need to pay.”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “It’s your business. I won’t take it for free.”</p><p>She stepped closer and lowered her voice, playful now. “Well… if you insist on paying, maybe you can do it differently.”</p><p>He glanced at her.</p><p>She stepped even closer, the playful glint in her eyes.</p><p>Natasha tilted her shoulders back slightly, puffing out her chest just enough that the soft curve of her off-shoulder top dipped lower, revealing the smooth head of her breast. Her short skirt rode up a fraction as she crossed her legs, one thigh sliding slowly over the other while she leaned against the glass counter.</p><p>Charles’s gaze dropped involuntarily, locking onto her breasts for a long moment. </p><p>“You… dressed beautifully today,” he said.</p><p>Natasha’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. She took another small step forward until she was close enough.</p><p>“Well I dressed like this today, because of you,” she murmured, her voice soft and teasing. “And… I can take it off because of you, too.”</p><p></p></div>
