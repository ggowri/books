        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div>Serena was the first to recover from the shock. She forced a smile, even though her mind was racing.<br/>She had planned everything differently:<br/>Get the CEO position without marriage.<br/>Pretend to be in a relationship with Charles for a few weeks. Break up quietly once things stabilise.<br/>But now? Her father had just announced a wedding in two weeks… and tied the CEO position directly to it.<br/>Serena let out a small, strained chuckle.<br/>“Father… don’t you think you’re moving a little fast?” she asked lightly. “We didn’t want to settle yet… Do we?”<br/>She turned to Charles with an exaggerated sweet smile.<br/>Charles, who was still startled, just laughed awkwardly. “Yeah, yeah… we still want time to… uhm… grow our love.”<br/>Collins suddenly chimed in, his voice dripping with bitterness.<br/>“First time you ever said something sensible,” he snapped at Serena. Then he turned to his father. “You are really moving too fast. You want to make her CEO?”<br/>Allison added immediately, glaring at Charles.<br/>“And this man..this man we barely even know, but you want to make her your assistant? Father, that’s unfair.”<br/>Serena raised her hands a little.<br/>“Uhm…I’m not talking about the CEO thing. Father, you can give me that anytime you want. Even now. But the wedding, let’s postpone it.”<br/>Collins nearly jumped to his feet.<br/>“What?! You want the CEO now? What makes you and your stupid fiancé worthy of it?”<br/>“Collins!” Mr. Moretti snapped, his voice sharp enough to cut glass.<br/>“This is exactly why I’m giving Serena the position.”<br/>The whole room went silent.<br/>Mr. Moretti stood, pointing at Collins with disappointment all over his face.<br/>“Look at you. You can’t even control yourself in front of everyone. How will you handle a company?” he said.<br/>“I can’t risk my legacy like this. I can’t trust you to deal with allies, partners, or even the simplest strategy”, He then faced Allison.<br/>“You aren't serious with your life. You are not smart enough to handle business.”<br/>Allison’s jaw dropped.<br/>Collins clenched his teeth so hard a vein popped at his forehead.<br/>Mr. Moretti continued firmly,<br/>“Serena is the only one here capable of leading. She knows the company. She understands everything. She can keep it running. You all need to support her. And yes, I will give both of you big positions too.”<br/>Collins scoffed loudly.<br/>“I’m the older brother… and you want to put my sister above me?!”.<br/>He slammed his fist on the table.<br/>“So I should worship her?!”.<br/>Mr. Moretti slammed his palm lightly on the table.<br/>“This isn’t about worshiping anyone,” he snapped. “She is the only one who can do it. And this is my final say. Serena will become the CEO.”<br/>His voice echoed through the entire grand room—loud enough to make everyone fall silent instantly.<br/>Then he turned to Serena.<br/>“But,” he added, “I can only give you the position if you finish your marriage and wedding with your fiancé.”<br/>Serena blinked fast. “Why, Father?”<br/>Mr. Moretti exhaled, looking straight into her eyes.<br/>“For a fact, I like Mr. Charles. And he is exactly the man you need beside you for that position.”<br/>Serena froze. Charles glanced at her from the corner of his eye.<br/>Mr. Moretti continued calmly,<br/>“I always thought you would marry some rich heir… someone wealthy like us. Someone who could support your rise to CEO.”<br/>He pointed at Charles.<br/>“But this man proved me wrong. He is the kind of man a leader needs.”<br/>Serena swallowed hard.<br/>“And Serena,” he added, “there is no way the board will accept you as CEO without a man by your side. They are old-fashioned vultures. They will cause unnecessary headaches.”<br/>He smiled proudly at the idea.<br/>“So after the wedding which will be two weeks from now—it will be big, loud, and prestigious. And right there at the ceremony, the CEO position will be announced.”<br/>Serena forced a weak smile.<br/>“Okay, Father… I understand.”<br/>“Good.” Mr. Moretti nodded with satisfaction. “So be quick with your decisions.”<br/>He clapped his hands loudly.<br/>“Bring us dinner! My awesome son-in-law needs to fill his stomach after all those troubled days.”<br/>××××<br/>After everything finally settled and the tense family meeting ended, Charles stepped outside. .<br/>Serena walked him out. Neither of them spoke at first. The silence between them stretched uncomfortably long.<br/>Then Serena finally said,<br/>“About what my father said…” she murmured. “I’m sorry for inconveniencing you. It seems I’ll have to look for another way to secure the position.”<br/>Charles nodded quietly. “Serena…”<br/>She turned slightly. “Hm?”<br/>“Why don’t you want to marry me?” he asked.<br/>Serena stopped walking.<br/>She looked at him, eyes wide, clearly startled.<br/>“Uhn… uhm…”<br/>Charles raised his hands a little. “I don’t mean it like that. I’m just saying—we can keep faking this even after the wedding. Maybe months later, we file for divorce. so you could secure the position ”<br/>Serena stared at him, surprised at how casually he said it.<br/>“Won’t your girlfriend be angry?” she asked.<br/>Charles frowned. “My girlfriend?”<br/>Serena lifted her brow. “Yeah. Lizzypie… or maybe Natasha.”<br/>Charles stared at her, confused, “They are my friends, best friends, I'm not dating any of them”.<br/>Serena found his reaction amusing.<br/>How could they just be friends?.<br/>Especially Lizzypie—who always hovered around Charles like he was her personal magnet. But Serena didn’t say any of that. She only gave him a soft smile.<br/>“You think that arrangement will be okay?” she asked quietly. “If you are fine with it… let’s do that. And I promise i will pay you handsomely.”<br/>Charles scoffed lightly. “Okay. Then let’s do that.”<br/>Serena nodded. “I’m very grateful.”<br/>Charles shook his head. “It’s nothing compared to how you helped me. You believed in me during the trial. You stood by me.”<br/>She scoffed, but her eyes warmed a little.<br/>They said their farewells, and Serena watched as he got into a taxi and drove away <br/>Inside the cab, Charles leaned back and sighed.<br/>“How would she think I’m dating Lizzypie?” he muttered. “Ridiculous.”<br/>He scoffed at himself, just Then his phone vibrated.<br/>He checked the screen.<br/>A message from Lizzypie:<br/>Where are you? Godfather has dropped the next mission.</div>
