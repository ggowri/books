        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div>Charles felt like disappearing after the words left his mouth. Serena, the beauty who had rejected countless powerful men, just agreed to be his fiancee?.<br/>Hearing this, Fred grew angry,  he pulled out his gun and pointed it at him. “What audacity! Who are you to say such a thing to Ms. Serena? You want to die?”<br/>Charles tried to stay calm and cool. Serena didn’t stop Fred; she just stared at him before asking, “You’re asking me to be engaged to you because you saved my life? I should have known you had something mischievous up your sleeve when you showed up so suddenly,” Serena said softly.<br/>Charles swallowed. “No… I didn’t save you for that. I… I just want to stay by your side. To protect you.” He didn’t even know what he was saying, he kept slipping.<br/>Fred’s face went red with fury. “Ms. Serena can protect herself…let alone with us, her bodyguards around. We are over two hundred. Say something like that again and I will blow your head off.”<br/>Charles managed to gather courage and said, “But none of you were there for her yesterday, when she nearly died.”<br/>“I said, shut up. Ma’am, what should I do to him? Kill him?” He said it like it was nothing.<br/>Serena watched them both, then thought for a moment. She had seen Charles’s skill and the way he had risked himself for her. Having someone such as him around was not bad,  perhaps even admirable for a personal bodyguard. <br/>But now he was proposing something else entirely. An engagement. Serena was the city goddess, what would people say if they saw her with someone with no name, no background?<br/>She smirked, immediately seeing an opportunity. She had been bothered by suitors for years.  Dozens, hundreds of men with petitions and promises. If she used this man as a placeholder, she could finally be left alone.<br/>She suddenly stated, “Fine. I will agree to it.”<br/>Charles stared, shocked. He hadn’t expected that; he hadn’t even known what pushed him to ask for the engagement. He had just tried his luck but Serena just said okay like that?<br/>“Really…you will get engaged to me?” he managed to say.<br/>Serena’s smile sharpened. “Don’t get cocky about it, as you know. You are nothing compared to me.” Her voice was cold.<br/>“This will be a fake engagement. You act as my fiancé so I get rid of the rest of the men who have been pestering me. I will even pay you for it. We will make it look real to the outside world. But we will be nothing. Absolutely nothing.”<br/>Charles’s face fell with cold disappointment when Serena first said okay. He thought she had a thing for him, but she would only use him.<br/>He quickly brushed it off. Who cares?. That would be huge progress for him. Either fake or real, he would have the engagement and get his reward from his grandfather.<br/>He smiled and nodded, “Yes… yeah… fine by me.”<br/>Fred wasn’t having it. “Ma’am. This man looks suspicious. He is dangerous. I think this would be a bad decision.”<br/>Serena scoffed. “He is little to no threat to me. If he does anything suspicious, don’t hesitate to blow his head off.”<br/>She was cold, saying it like he wasn’t even there. Charles gulped, hoping he hadn’t dragged himself to his death. This lady, the one his grandfather told him to get engaged to might be deadly!<br/>Fred, satisfied by the response, nodded. “Okay, ma’am. At your command.”<br/>Charles then gulped and said he wouldn’t let this opportunity slip by. “But… I would like to propose a bet.”<br/>Serena frowned a little. “A bet? What is that?”<br/>“Within two months: if I manage to capture your heart, prove my worth, and make you fall for me, you will have to marry me,” the words escaped his mouth with another attempt at luck.<br/>Serena couldn’t help but burst into laughter.<br/>This even made Fred angrier. “You keep surprising me each time you open your mouth! How dare you even think of marrying goddess Serena. Are you dreaming?”<br/>Serena scoffed. “I am curious, what can someone like you do? What can you offer to make me fall in love or prove yourself worthy?”<br/>Charles leaned forward and said, “What if I solve your family problem?”<br/>Serena frowned. “Our problem? We don’t have one. We are the most powerful family in this nation. What are you even speaking of?”<br/>Charles, who had already done his research yesterday, had noticed how Mr. Moretti was overly polite to investor Mr. Vasilios. He had also noticed Mr. Moretti acting subservient while doing everything to please him, so Charles did his research.<br/>He leaned forward, his tone calm but firm, each word carrying weight.<br/>“The Moretti family’s core business is oil and gas. Over seventy percent of your revenue flows from export trade. And all that… every last shipment… is handled through Mr. Vasilios’s docks. He is more than an investor in your company.”<br/>He paused before continuing. “Mr. Vasilios isn't just wealthy. He’s influential and connected to many people. Your family might be big, but has many small enterprises supporting you and this same enterprise has Mr. Vasilios”.<br/>“ That’s why your family continues dealing with him. Every three months, Mr. Vasilios raises the transport fees. And still you pay. Billions vanish from the Moretti accounts each year. Not from bad oil prices. Not from weak markets. From transport alone.”<br/>Charles let the weight of his words sink in before adding, “The danger now is bigger. Vasilios has begun branching into land transportation as well. Soon, you will have no choice but to use him for every route. Total dependency. That was the true purpose of last night’s party to find more investors and please Mr. Vasilios.”<br/>Serena was so impressed Charles could outline their current problem.<br/>“I can find you a solution. Within two months,” Charles said.<br/>Serena couldn’t help but scoff. “I am impressed by your correct analysis, truly, but… you can find a solution? Even the Moretti family has been in loop. Almost everyone has Mr. Vasilios as a supporter. But you can find a solution. Stop doing or saying anything to please me!”.</div>
