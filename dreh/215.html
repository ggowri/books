        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div><p>Everyone was amazed by how this was turning out.</p><p>Jimmy let the silence stretch, then dipped his hand into his inner pocket and pulled out a flash drive.</p><p>“And this,” he said, holding it up, “is the Pandora Box. Where every information we talked about contain”</p><p>A ripple ran through the room.</p><p>“I personally safeguarded it under Mr. Moretti’s direct instruction,” Jimmy continued. “Only one successor was authorized to receive it.”</p><p>He looked straight at Serena.</p><p>“I also confirm, without reservation, that Mr. Moretti authored the document,” he added calmly. “We drafted it together.”</p><p>Collins shook his head. “That’s impossible. You all lying, you are fabricating things”</p><p>Jimmy reached into his pocket again, this time pulling out his phone. “As a precaution, Mr. Moretti requested a video attestation while signing the document ”</p><p>He tapped the screen of his tablet and turned it toward the room.</p><p>The video played.</p><p>Mr. Moretti appeared on screen, seated, composed, unmistakably alive in that moment. His voice was steady, deliberate.</p><p>“I, Alessandro Moretti, in full mental capacity, appoint my daughter, Serena Moretti, as the next CEO of Moretti Enterprises and head of the Moretti family. This decision is final.”</p><p>The video ended, everyone went mute. </p><p>This kind of recording was known legally as a video testamentary attestation—a lawyer-witnessed video confirmation used to reinforce written directives. Nothing can dispute it.</p><p>Jimmy lowered the phone. “So,” he said evenly, “does anyone have anything else to say?”</p><p>Mr. Gerald and Collins stared at each other.</p><p>There was nothing left for them to say. </p><p>Jimmy stepped forward and placed the document into Serena’s hands. Then he set the flash drive gently on top of it.</p><p>“With this,” he said, “you are officially the CEO!”</p><p>Mr. Valentino straightened and then bowed for Serena also.</p><p>“I promised your father,” he said solemnly, “that I would serve and protect you, no matter the cost.”</p><p>Serena’s breath caught. She hadn’t seen this coming. Her eyes softened and she smiled as he collected the file.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said. “I truly appreciate it.”</p><p>Then her expression changed.</p><p>She turned to Mr. Gerald.</p><p>“Why are you still sitting there,” she asked coldly. “Stand up. Now.”</p><p>Mr. Gerald swallowed hard. The room watched as he rose, humiliation written all over him, and stepped aside.</p><p>Serena walked past him without a glance. She reached the head of the table and sat down majestically. </p><p>Mr. Gerald remained standing.</p><p>Serena looked around the room.</p><p>“As you’ve all witnessed,” she said calmly, “I am the rightful CEO and the head of the Moretti family.”</p><p>She rested her hands on the table.</p><p>“I am not taking this position for personal gain. I am here for the growth of this company and the future of this family. I will take it to the next horizon.”</p><p>Her gaze swept across every face.</p><p>“I expect your full cooperation,” she finished. “And I believe you will give it.”</p><p>The room stayed silent.</p><p>Serena leaned back slightly, her fingers resting against the arm of the chair.</p><p>“Well,” she said,“my first policy starts now.”</p><p>The room stiffened.</p><p>She looked around slowly. “I’m raising everyone’s salary by twenty percent.”</p><p>For a split second, no one breathed.</p><p>Then the murmuring exploded.</p><p>“Did she just say twenty percent?” </p><p>“Is she serious?” </p><p>“That’s… that’s huge.”</p><p>Serena raised her hand, and the room quieted.</p><p>Mr. Moretti paid every member of this family because he believed we were meant to build the company together. That is why there was no WILL for split Inheritance.  </p><p>Serena continued “Yes. I will increase everyone salary”</p><p>Relief spread across several faces.</p><p>“But…That raise only applies if you actually contribute,” Serena said evenly. “You will hold your role. You will do the work that role requires and will earn what you’re paid.”</p><p>Groans rippled through the room.</p><p>Because everyone knew the truth.</p><p>When Mr. Moretti was alive, many of them barely showed up. They collected salaries, used influence, and contributed nothing.</p><p>Serena leaned forward. “Let me be clear. You don’t work, you don’t get paid. No contribution, no raise.”</p><p>The murmuring returned, darker this time.</p><p>“I knew it.” </p><p>“She’s already tightening the leash.”</p><p> “She’s going to make things unbearable.”</p><p>Serena scoffed softly, then she turned her head.</p><p>Her gaze locked onto Collins and Mr. Gerald</p><p>“And now,” she said, “ yes, you both have to face the consequences of your behaviour!”</p><p>The room went still again.</p><p>She faced Mr. Gerald</p><p>“You forced my father’s burial without informing me or consulting me,” Serena said coldly. </p><p>“You betrayed him. You tried to seize this family and this company while the investigation is going on! You don&#x27;t deserve to be in this family, and for that, your income in this family will be seized for 6 months!!”</p><p>Mr. Gerald couldn&#x27;t believe this, “What!  Six months, how are you expecting me to survive?”.</p><p>Mr. Valentino chimed in, “Really?  You still have the audacity to babble. She is even graceful, I would have sent you away from the family!”.</p><p>Mr. Gerald&#x27;s lips hit each other. He was seriously fuming,but he did not utter any word as Serena gazed at him. </p><p>“You have anything to say?”, Serena asked him.</p><p>Mr. Gerald just stayed mute and didn&#x27;t know what to say. </p><p>Then she looked back at Collins alone.</p><p>“You were banished from this family once before,” she said. “and you come back”.</p><p>.</p><p>“For you to be accepted back into this family,” she said calmly, “you will kneel. Right here. And you will apologize to me. for everything you have done.”</p><p>A stunned silence followed.</p><p>Collins let out a short, disbelieving laugh. “You want me to kneel for you? I&#x27;m your brother,  remember?”</p><p>“Yes,” Serena replied without hesitation. “A brother that nearly killed me. That is nothing compared to what you did.”</p><p>Collins slowly stood up.</p><p>His face hardened.</p><p>“I would rather die,” he said coldly. “I will  leave this family, just like you want.”</p><p>He paused, eyes locked on hers.</p><p>“But don’t think this is over. I won’t back down, I will do everything I can to drag you down. Whatever it takes. Even if it&#x27;s meant killing you”</p><p>What!.</p><p>Did he just threaten to kill her?</p><p>She leaned back in her chair, utterly composed. “Is that a threat?”</p><p>Collins smiled darkly. “Take it however you want.” With that he turned around, grabbed Tracy&#x27;s hand and stormed out of the room. </p><p></p></div>
