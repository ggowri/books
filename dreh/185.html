        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div><p>Even Serena was stunned by what Charles said.</p><p>She turned sharply to look at him, her brows knitting together. </p><p>Tracy was the first to burst into laughter.</p><p>“Wow,” she said, clapping lightly. “You nearly got me there.”</p><p>She shook her head, still laughing. “Of course. Everyone knows the CEO. We all know her. That isn’t a big deal.”</p><p>Her smile turned sharp. “So what are you saying now? That you’ll just walk in and meet her directly?”</p><p>Charles nodded without hesitation. “Of course. I will meet her directly.”</p><p>The humor drained from Tracy’s face.</p><p>Her eyes hardened and her lips pressed together before she sneered. “Are you really willing to go that far just to disgrace yourself?”</p><p>Charles’ voice remained calm. “This isn’t about disgrace. I know Sapphire personally.”</p><p>At that, Collins couldn’t hold it anymore. He burst out laughing loudly, drawing a few glances from people nearby.</p><p>“Just shut up, Charles,” he said between laughs. “Enough with the bluffing.”</p><p>He wiped an imaginary tear from his eye and scoffed. “You mean that Sapphire? The biggest and hottest woman in the industry right now? You really expect us to believe she knows someone as lowly as you?”</p><p>Charles met his gaze evenly. “Well,” he said, unbothered, “we shall see.”</p><p>He took a step forward. “So please move out of the way and let us enter.”</p><p>Collins’ smile vanished.</p><p>He spread his arm slightly, blocking them completely. “No,” he said firmly. “I’m not letting you go in.”</p><p>Charles’ voice dropped, sharp and dangerous.</p><p>“Move,” he said quietly, “or I will break your hand.”</p><p>Serena’s heart lurched. She grabbed his arm. “Charles, let’s just go back,” she said urgently. “They already won it, like they said.”</p><p>“No, Serena,” Charles replied without looking at her. “Nothing is sure until we meet them ourselves.”</p><p>Collins scoffed. “Even Serena knows it’s a done deal for us. Why don’t you have any common sense?”</p><p>Charles’ eyes flicked to him, cold and merciless. “I’m not repeating myself. Move. Or I will break your hands.”</p><p>There was venom in his tone this time. It made Collins stiffen. For a brief moment, he felt that chill crawl up his spine as he met Charles’ stare. Still, he refused to back down.</p><p>He sneered. “Fine. If you force your way in, I’ll make sure you get embarrassed in every way possible. Tracy’s friend is inside. We will use her. The COO will disgrace you publicly. Think twice.”</p><p>Charles looked at him, unimpressed. “Are you done?”</p><p>Then he stepped forward.</p><p>Collins hesitated, then reluctantly moved aside.</p><p>Charles walked past him without another glance, Serena following closely beside him.</p><p>Inside, the space was just as vast as the outside. The polished floor gleamed so brightly it could pass for a mirror.</p><p>Behind them, Collins clenched his fists, fury burning in his eyes. He turned to Tracy. “Please, babe. Let’s embarrass them.”</p><p>Tracy’s lips curved into a smirk, her eyes dark with anger. “Yes,” she said softly. “Let’s do that.” She wanted to teach Charles some lessons also.</p><p>Together, they followed them inside.</p><p>Inside, the atmosphere shifted immediately.</p><p>Serena and Charles approached the reception desk, the quiet hum of the building pressing around them. Serena was the first to speak, steadying herself.</p><p>“Good morning,” she said politely. “I’m here to discuss a business proposal and seek a possible partnership.”</p><p>The receptionist smiled professionally. “Alright. You will be meeting with the COO then. May I know which company you’re representing? I will give him a call.”</p><p>Before Serena could respond, Charles spoke calmly. “No. Call Sapphire. Tell her Charles is here.”</p><p>The receptionist froze.</p><p>Her fingers paused above the keyboard as she looked up at him, clearly startled by how casually he said it. She leaned in slightly, lips parting, about to ask a question—</p><p>When a sudden shriek cut through the lobby.</p><p>“Tracyyyyyyy!”</p><p>Everyone turned.</p><p>A blonde woman rushed forward and wrapped Tracy in a tight hug, squealing with excitement. She was undeniably beautiful, and polished.</p><p>Serena leaned closer to Charles and murmured, “That must be the friend. Linda”</p><p>At that moment, a plus-sized man walked in from the side hallway. He had a protruding belly and a balding head. He wasn’t ugly, just… ordinary. Nothing striking about him.</p><p>The blonde woman immediately released Tracy and hurried to him, smiling brightly. “Hubby,” she said sweetly, “this is my friend and her fiancé. The ones I told you about.”</p><p>The receptionist straightened instantly. “That’s him,” she said under her breath. “The COO.”</p><p>Serena and Charles stared as greetings were exchanged, smiles spreading across their faces.</p><p>It was obvious to Serena almost immediately.</p><p>The COO’s attention never truly left the blonde woman’s side. He would be so insecure. And he would do whatever Linda told him to do.</p><p>Even Charles couldn’t deny it.</p><p>Linda was striking. Tall. Confidence. Dressed in a way that drew eyes without effort. There was no mistaking in her smooth skin. A man like the COO did not end up with a woman like her without money being the glue that held it together.</p><p>And because of that, he would never risk displeasing her.</p><p>That realization crushed Serena further.</p><p>Before she could gather her thoughts, the COO smiled broadly and spoke to collins. “My beautiful fiancée has told me a lot about you two. I’m very delighted to give you the partnership. Your proposal is solid as well.”</p><p>He gestured inward. “Please. Come inside and let’s sign it officially.”</p><p>Collins turned slowly toward Serena, a victorious grin spreading across his face.</p><p>But just as they were about to move, Collins spoke again.</p><p>“But sir,” he said smoothly, “I would like to make a small request.”</p><p>The COO paused. “What is it?”</p><p>Collins turned and pointed directly at Serena and Charles. “These two people abused me and my wife before we entered. Can you throw them out?”.</p><p>Serena&#x27;s heart tightened hearing this, Collins was really going to do what he said, disgracing and humiliating them.</p><p></p></div>
