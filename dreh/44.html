        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div>Charles was so surprised to hear Mrs. Hailey’s outburst. How could Tracy be in danger because of him?<br/>Then she continued, “Because of you… she is now with Tiger, that wicked and cruelest thug! She went there to save you.”<br/>Charles couldn’t help but scoff at what she said. How would Tracy go to Tiger to save him? Why would she even care?<br/>He replied, “I didn’t send her there. I’m sure she is not with Tiger because of me.”<br/>“Oh she is. You dirty, stupid poor man! She was afraid because of what went down in Mr. Vacilous’ party. She believed that Tiger would come back, and she was worried. You better come now and do something about it. Nothing must happen to my daughter!” Mrs. Hailey cried before she hung up.<br/>Charles was surprised by all he just heard. Tracy really went to Tiger because of him? That would be entirely out of character for Tracy.<br/>He immediately stood up and prepared to go.<br/>LizzyPie stopped him. “That would be foolish of you. Your ex-wife that cheated on you, divorced you, and even humiliated you just moments ago—you want to go and save her?”<br/>“But, she was apparently with Tiger because of me. I must do something,” he said, dressing up.<br/>LizzyPie shook her head in pity. “I am sure you can never be the Godfather with this soft, simp character of yours. Not to mention that even with your X-ray power, you can never defeat Tiger and his goons. You will die!”<br/>Charles didn’t listen to him. Lizzy tried several times, but he wasn’t listening.<br/>×××××<br/>Meanwhile, outside the big villa of Tiger’s mansion, Mrs. Hailey and Derek wandered up and down.<br/>They had tried to stop Tracy, but she didn’t listen.<br/>Mrs. Hailey faced Derek. “Please save my daughter, Derek. You can’t just stand outside here while my daughter could die inside.”<br/>Derek spat on the ground, shaking his head.<br/>“You want me to enter that place full of guns? Tracy is the stupid one to go inside there because of her useless ex-husband,” he said, his eyes flashing cold.<br/>Mrs. Hailey grabbed his arm, desperate. “Please, Derek, do this for me. If you save my daughter, I will give you many styles… collapse doggy, BDSM, pegging, I will even lick you to your anus.”<br/>Derek froze. The words burned into his brain. He had been fucking Mrs. Hailey for months, but she never allowed BDSM, never allowed him that darkness he craved. Now she was promising everything. His body trembled at the thought, but then he shut it out violently.<br/>“What is BDSM if a bullet is already in my head?”he thought.<br/>He tightened his jaw. “Mmm… I don’t know. But I will do something,” he muttered, half to himself. But he knew he wouldn’t do anything. In fact, he was here in the first place because he had already lost Mr. Vasilos and also Mr. Morreti. Tracy was his only plan now. So he was here to act like he cared. If not, he would have left since.<br/>Just then, footsteps echoed behind them. Charles appeared, walking straight toward them.<br/>Mrs. Hailey’s eyes widened, then twisted into disgust. She pointed at him with shaking hands.<br/>“You! Always trouble. Because of you, my daughter is inside with Tiger. If you are really a man, go in and save her. Don’t just stand there with your pathetic face!”<br/>Derek glanced at Charles with sharp anger, his fists balling.<br/>×××××<br/>Inside Tiger’s compound, there were at least 50 thugs armed with guns and bombs, and inside the room, another 20.<br/>In the main sitting room was Tiger and his son, Majik. The room was spacious, well lit, and smelled elegant.<br/>The father and son sat on the sofa, while Tracy stood behind them, pleading.<br/>Tracy began, “I am here to ask for forgiveness for what happened to your son today. Please forgive me and whoever is involved.”<br/>Tiger scoffed. “Asking for forgiveness? We, the Tiger Fangs gang, never forgive. We go by the saying, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ And my son doesn’t even care about having revenge on you, but that bastard that beat up my son—I will kill him.”<br/>Tracy stammered, “Your son… he started it first. He flirted with me, molested me, and even grabbed my ass.”<br/>“What are you here for, blame or forgiveness?” Tiger frowned, then picked one of the cigarettes in front of him.<br/>The bodyguard lit it for him. He inhaled deeply, puffing the smoke straight at Tracy.<br/>Tracy shook, terrified. “Okay… I am here to ask for forgiveness.”<br/>“Where is the man? Where is that man that beat my men up? He is the one supposed to be here, not you.”<br/>Tracy gulped. She was here to protect Charles and didn’t want anyone to point fingers back at him. “It all started with me, and it should also end here,” she said, bringing a small box she had prepared.<br/>The bodyguard moved the box closer to Tiger. Inside were two bars of gold, each worth $500,000.<br/>“Wow… I can see you are good at negotiation.”<br/>“Please, forget about all that happened. I am sorry for what happened; take that as my… gift to you and your son,” Tracy said.<br/>Tiger laughed out loud. Tracy smiled, thinking it was going the way she wanted until Tiger switched. “You think you can pay for my son’s broken nose and the humiliation he went through? He wants revenge, and I am going to give him that.”<br/>“But your son was the one who did wrong here!” Tracy protested, unable to hold it in.<br/>Majik chimed in, “Because I wanted to grab your ass. There is nothing wrong with that.”<br/>Tiger added, “Oh, I can see you’ve got some guts. But I have no problem with you. It’s those that beat up my son—I will have him killed. No matter how strong he is, he can’t face the thousands of Tiger Fangs.”<br/>Tracy grew desperate, not wanting Charles to be in danger because of her. Though they had broken up, she had recently started to regret it. Only her pride didn’t want to let it show in front of him.<br/>She whimpered, “I told you, this started because of me, so end it with me. Why are you doing this?”<br/>“Good.” Tiger nodded and stood up. <br/>He walked to where Tracy was and touched her face. “I really see why my son lost control because of you.” his voice thick with lust. "Now get on your knees... and suck me."<br/>He chuckled, as his other hand closed roughly over her breast.</div>
