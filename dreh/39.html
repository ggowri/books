        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div>Derek immediately went pale and trembled. Barking in front of everyone would be beyond humiliating, almost unbearable to even imagine.<br/>“Uhm… I think this is unfair. I bought the most expensive gift, and he just played some psychological trick. And I should bark? That’s unfair,” he argued weakly, his voice trembling.<br/>Charles’s voice cut in, steady and cold like a blade. “We didn’t bet on who bought the most expensive thing. We bet on what Ms. Janet would cherish the most. And I won. So you have to honor the bet.”<br/>Derek clenched his fists tightly, refusing to move.<br/>Charles then turned toward Janet. “Ma’am… you said you are the witness. Please, ask him to bark or he should just be thrown out.”<br/>Janet let out a heavy sigh and nodded slowly. “Yes. A bet is a bet. You shouldn’t take back your word, Mr. Derek.”<br/>Derek’s last hope was Mr. Vasilios. He turned desperately toward him, but Mr. Vasilios only gave him a hard, piercing glare.<br/>“What are you waiting for? Do what you promised. Or are you not a man of your word? If that’s the case, then from today, I’ll see you as unworthy.”<br/>At that moment, Derek knew it was over. If he refused, he would fall into Mr. Vasilios’s bad side, and after already offending Serena, he couldn’t afford another powerful enemy.<br/>So he had no choice. He had to bark.<br/>He stepped forward, shoulders slumped, looking like a shamed boy who had wet the bed long ago. All eyes were on him, cutting into his skin.<br/>“He shouldn’t have opened his mouth to make that bet. Now look at him.”<br/>“Serves him right. Always talking too much—now he will humiliate himself.”<br/>The same people who were cheering him minutes ago were now mocking him, laughing in cruel whispers.<br/>Derek lowered his head and let out a faint, pitiful sound. “Woof…”<br/>Charles tilted his head slightly. “Uhm… did anyone hear that? I didn’t.”<br/>Serena smirked faintly. “I didn’t hear anything either.”<br/>Lizzypie giggled softly. “It sounded more like a puppy whining than a bark.”<br/>Derek’s face burned hot. He wanted the ground to swallow him whole instantly.<br/>Finally, with no escape, he lifted his head and barked louder. “Woof! Woof!”<br/>Laughter erupted loudly through the entire hall. <br/>“Woof! Woof!” he repeated, each bark stabbing his pride deeper and deeper.<br/>Even Charles laughed openly.<br/>Mr. Vasilios finally raised his hand. “Well, I hope that will do. Since everything is settled, let’s move on. This is my daughter’s engagement night, and it shouldn’t be so somber. Music, please!”<br/>The band struck up, and the party began again. Guests laughed, drank, and danced joyfully, but Derek couldn’t enjoy a single second. He had barked like a dog in front of everyone. His reputation was shredded forever, and all he could do now was look for an escape route.<br/>At this moment, Tracy walked toward Charles and leaned in.<br/> “You shouldn’t have gone to such a length, you just made Derek bark in front of everyone!”<br/>Charles couldn’t help but scoff at Tracy’s hypocrisy, she was there when Derek was humiliating him, and even she had cooked up a lie. Now he was the bad one?<br/>Charles sneered. “Just go far away from me. You are not a human, I regret ever meeting you.”<br/>Tracy opened her mouth to retort angrily when a new voice cut through the music.<br/>“Hey, pretty. Can we have a talk?”<br/>She turned and saw a man..his face rough, scar slashing across his jawline, yet dressed in a tailored suit that screamed money and arrogance. <br/>Tracy hissed coldly. “I’m not interested.”<br/>The man smirked and stepped closer. “Don’t be like that. Just a little talk, it won’t harm you.”<br/>“I said I am not interested.”<br/>He leaned down, lowering his voice. “Look, I will spoil you with money.”<br/>Tracy’s lip curled with disgust. “Screw you and your money. Leave me alone.”<br/>The man’s smirk twisted into something darker. Without warning, he reached out and grabbed her buttocks roughly.<br/>Tracy’s face flared red with rage. Smack! Her palm cracked across his cheek hard. “Are you insane? How dare you touch me?”<br/>Gasps rippled sharply around the nearby guests.<br/>The man froze for a moment, shocked, then his eyes turned murderous. “You bitch. You dare slap me? For that, I will touch your breasts too—” He reached out.<br/>Charles shot forward instinctively, rage blazing in his eyes, but before he could move further, a hand gripped his arm hard. Serena’s.<br/>Her whisper was sharp against his ear. “Don’t. That’s the Tiger Fang leader’s son. They control the largest thugs in the city. Even Mr. Vasilios won’t want to cross them. They don’t care about reputation… they will shed blood just to prove a point. Don’t intervene.”</div>
