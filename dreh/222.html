        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div><p>Charles walked out of the room without looking back.</p><p>He had barely taken three steps when Mr. Belly  hurried  behind him.</p><p>“Hey man!”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Mr. Belly came rushing at him. He stopped in front of Charles and immediately bowed deeply.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said,  “I truly apologize for Raphael’s behavior.”</p><p>Charles blinked, then waved it off calmly.</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Charles gave a faint scoff. “We just have a little ruffle. He thinks I’m here for retaliation or some dirty scheme.”</p><p>Mr. Belly let out a tired breath.  “Honestly,” he muttered, “I didn’t even take it personally. I understand how much of a troublemaker he can be.”</p><p>Charles nodded.</p><p>For a moment, Mr. Belly hesitated, as if swallowing something heavy in his chest. Then he finally spoke, voice softer.</p><p>“I’m really grateful for what you did.”</p><p>Charles glanced at him.</p><p>“Saving my daughter… that was not something anyone else dared to do. I will pay you handsomely for it.”</p><p>Charles was about to reject it but mr. Belly stepped closer, lowering his voice.</p><p>“But… if you do me a favor…I will pay you even more. Much more.”</p><p>Charles frowned, suspicion flickering.</p><p>“A favor?” he repeated. “You don’t even know me.”</p><p>He added. </p><p>“And you were the only one who didn’t accuse me of causing the fire. How can you trust me to ask for  a favour”</p><p>Mr. Belly scoffed,“About the fire… I already know who did it.”</p><p>Charles’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Mr. Belly nodded, firm.</p><p>“You shouldn&#x27;t worry about that, the person will be horribly punished.”</p><p>Charles felt a strange twist in his stomach.</p><p>He knew who did it but was acting like he didn&#x27;t all along?.</p><p>He  steadied himself and asked,</p><p>“Then what is this favor about?”</p><p>Mr. Belly’s voice dropped even lower. “I want you,” he whispered, “to tail Gabriella’s fiancé.”</p><p>Charles’ brows pulled together. “Raphael?”</p><p>Mr. Belly nodded once.</p><p>Charles stared at him. “That one? Why would you want me to do that?”</p><p>Mr. Belly found a more quiet place for them and laid down everything. </p><p>The engagement between Gabriella and  Raphael had never been about love.It had been arranged almost twenty years ago, long before Gabriella even understood what marriage meant. </p><p>Back then, Gabriella had been born crippled, and worse, with a heart condition so fragile that any moment could have been her last.</p><p>Doctors predicted she would die young.</p><p>That was when the Trisian family approached.At the time, they were nothing compared to him. </p><p>Mr. Belly was already wealthy beyond measure. Snyx World was already rising. The Trisian were nothing. </p><p>They claimed they had methods, treatments and resources that could keep Gabriella alive. They even swore they could one day make her walk.</p><p>But there was a price. They wanted sponsorship and a very big Investment plus Access to Synx World’s wealth and influence.</p><p>And more than that… They wanted Raphael to marry Gabriella. His only child, that would inherit everything.</p><p>Which meant that one day, Raphael wouldn’t just marry into the family. He would take over the company.</p><p>And with it, the Trisian family would own everything Mr. Belly had built.</p><p>Mr. Belly knew exactly what it meant.But when the choice was his daughter’s life or his empire, he chose her.</p><p>He accepted this.</p><p>And in truth, Gabriella didn’t die young.</p><p>She survived. But even now, the heart problem remains. The Trisian family always claimed they were treating it. Also, she wasn&#x27;t even able to walk. </p><p>Mr. Belly’s face tightened. “I feel they are deceiving me and only after my money,” he said quietly. “So I want you to find that out.”</p><p>Charles scoffed at this. Mr. Belly continued.</p><p>He couldn’t just call off the engagement. He couldn’t break the contract either, not without proof. The Trisian family had wrapped everything in signed papers. </p><p>Without evidence, he was trapped. And worse…Gabriella was truly in love with Raphael.</p><p>But Mr. Belly had always suspected Raphael was sinister, that he was only playing the role of a perfect fiancé until the day he could take everything just as his family planned. </p><p>Charles listened, making sense of everything.</p><p>The Trisian family’s rise was all  built on Mr. Belly’s wealth.That was why they were so powerful now and popular. </p><p>And suddenly, Charles understood. why Godfather wanted him close to Gabriella.</p><p>Godfather wanted the Trisian family destroyed at the root. If Mr. Belly stop sponsoring them, they will financially crumble. </p><p>Charles scoffed faintly. As usual, Godfather&#x27;s mission always had reasons. He stayed silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Mr. Belly misunderstood the silence. He thought Charles was refusing.</p><p>So he added quickly, “I’m asking because Gabriella said you are also a Cultivator. Like them. You have power.”</p><p>His voice lowered.</p><p>“If you can help me find anything… anything at all…” He swallowed. “I will give you twenty billion dollars.”</p><p>Charles lifted his head sharply.</p><p></p></div>
