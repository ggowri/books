        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles gulped as he looked around, his grip tightening for a split second before he forced himself to relax.&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes moved fast, scanning the circle of guns, the distance between each man, Natasha&rsquo;s position, the leader&rsquo;s breathing. He was calculating.&nbsp;</p><p>He was just about to make his move when a loud voice cut through the tension.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is happening here?&rdquo;</p><p>The words hit like a command which made everyone freeze.</p><p>Even the men pointing their guns hesitated.</p><p>Charles turned his head.</p><p>Walking toward them was a young man, clearly younger than Charles, with messy curly hair and a face that still carried a trace of boyish innocence.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t look tense. If anything, he looked annoyed, like someone interrupted mid-meal.</p><p>Everyone immediately bowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Young Master Jeremy!&rdquo;.</p><p>The man still trapped under Charles&rsquo;s arm immediately shouted, &ldquo;This fucker came here and started causing a ruckus!&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy stopped a few steps away and looked at Charles. They stared at each other for a moment.</p><p>Then the young man spoke, his tone casual.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; you can&rsquo;t capture and kill him?&rdquo;</p><p>He said it like it was nothing. With that, Charles knew he was just another bray.&nbsp;</p><p>The leader gritted his teeth. &ldquo;He seems to have super power.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing that, Jeremy scoffed softly. &ldquo;Oh? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped closer, eyes roaming over Charles with open curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;what are you looking for here in the Hierem clan, showing off your power like this?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles released the leader, who immediately coughed.&nbsp; Then Charles stepped forward to the man.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here to meet my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lizzypie.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing the name, Jeremy&rsquo;s expression shifted. It was brief but Charles didn&rsquo;t miss it. Which confirm he knew lizzypie.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t wait for a response.</p><p>&ldquo;Call her out,&rdquo; Charles said firmly. &ldquo;I want to talk to her.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy let out a short laugh. &ldquo;And why should I do that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; Charles replied. &ldquo;Her friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy scoffed and nodded in realization. &ldquo;You must be that fool who didn't let her come here all those months ago.&rdquo; His smile turned sharp. &ldquo;You two must have been badly in love for you to come here for her. &rdquo;</p><p>Natasha was just observing things.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy leaned forward slightly. &ldquo;Sadly for you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;she belongs to me now.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s eyes hardened. &ldquo;What the fuck do you think you are saying?&rdquo;. Getting angrier.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s smile faded. &ldquo;Maybe I should remind you,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;you are in the Hierem clan.&rdquo;</p><p>He took another step forward. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t like what happens to you if you don&rsquo;t tread carefully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Charles shot back. &ldquo;Hierem clan, or whatever the fuck you call yourselves. Call out Lizzypie.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy raised a brow. &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t hesitate. &ldquo;I will force my way in.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy burst into laughter. Several of the guards joined him, the sound sharp and mocking.</p><p>&ldquo;Hahaha. Is that bravery,&rdquo; Jeremy said, wiping his eyes, &ldquo;or pure stupidity?&rdquo;</p><p>He spread his arms slightly. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t even be able to get past me. Talk less of my men out here, and the ones inside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Charles said. &ldquo;I will fight my way in. You are all nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>His way of speaking made Jeremy more mad.</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s face twisted. &ldquo;We are nothing?&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;I think that little power you have is confusing you.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice dropped, sharp and cruel. &ldquo;By the time we&rsquo;re done with you, you will be on your knees, begging for death.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles smiled coldly. &ldquo;Small power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want to call it. But with it, I can beat you and all your men easily.&rdquo;</p><p>He intentionally said that so he could&nbsp; provoke him.&nbsp;</p><p>It worked.</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s eyes burned. He was not a man who tolerated his authority being challenged. Especially not in front of his people.</p><p>&ldquo;You are bluffing!. And asking for death" Jeremy snapped. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you think, why don&rsquo;t we have a one-on-one spar?&rdquo;</p><p>The courtyard went still for some moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t even let the moment cool.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said immediately. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it. If I beat you, you call Lizzypie out for me.&rdquo;</p><p>A murmur rippled through the guards.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I lose,&rdquo; Charles continued calmly, &ldquo;I will leave this place without asking any questions.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy laughed darkly. &ldquo;Fuck you. You think you can just walk away after I whoop your ass?&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned forward, voice dripping with malice. &ldquo;If you lose, I will&nbsp; have both your feet cut off. You will drag yourself out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then I will bet on that.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone couldn't believe he agreed to that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>The guards stared. Some of them whispered under their breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he crazy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know who he&rsquo;s challenging?&rdquo;.</p><p>Even Jeremy hesitated for a brief moment, clearly caught off guard by Charles&rsquo;s level of confidence.</p><p>Behind them, Natasha snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Charles, no!&rdquo;</p><p>She rushed forward and grabbed his arm, pulling him back hard.</p></div>
