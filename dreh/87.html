        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div><p>The leader scoffed softly and then stepped close to her. “What makes you think we were sent by Norman, or whatever that name is, huh?”</p><p>Natasha froze for a moment, her breath trembling. </p><p>The only name she could think of was Norman. He was the only person she had ever truly offended, and he was also the only one who could possibly pull something like this off. So she believed it instantly. It had to be him.</p><p>“I know he sent you,” she said, her voice shaking but determined. “But please, stop this. I’ll give you anything you want, any amount. This is my business you’re destroying. Please, be considerate.”</p><p>Her words came out desperate, trembling with both fear and courage. She didn’t even know where that courage came from, but she clung to it.</p><p>The thugs exchanged a glance, their lips curling into twisted smirks. The leader tilted his head and said mockingly, “Did you just say we can ask you for anything, huh?”</p><p>Natasha nodded repeatedly, fearfully. “Yes. Anything. Whatever you want, I’ll do it for you. You want money, right? I can pay you double what whoever sent you gave. Please, just spare my shop. I worked too hard for this.”</p><p>The leader raised his hand, signaling the others to stop. The smashing and breaking instantly ceased. He turned back to her slowly, his grin widening.</p><p>“We don’t need your money,” he said.</p><p>Natasha blinked, confused, and then smiled slightly in relief. “I’m so grateful then. Thank you so much,” she said quickly, trying to sound polite even in terror.</p><p>“But we’ll need your body,” the leader said, licking his lips as he stepped closer.</p><p>Natasha froze. </p><p>Her heart slammed hard against her chest, and her body started shaking uncontrollably. She understood exactly what he meant, and fear rushed through her veins like fire. She stepped backward, shaking her head rapidly.</p><p>“Please don’t do this,” she pleaded. “I told you, I’ll give you any amount you want. Just don’t touch me. Please.”</p><p>The leader laughed softly, his eyes gleaming with lust. “I’m already hard just looking at you. You look so damn sexy, and I can’t wait to have you. Just one round, and me and my boys will leave. In fact, we’ll even turn against the boss who sent us. Just a little session with you, and you’ll never see us again.”</p><p>Natasha’s stomach twisted. Every word he said made her sick. She wasn’t ready to sell her dignity like that. </p><p>She was a virgin. She had never even been with a man. The thought of giving herself to a random thug like this made her want to die on the spot. She would rather die than give in.</p><p>She turned sharply, trying to run toward the exit, but the leader was faster. He grabbed her by the hair, yanking her back so hard she screamed.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going, pretty?” he sneered, dragging her closer as she struggled in his grip.</p><p>“Leave me alone! Please!” Natasha cried out, tears filling her eyes as she fought against him, but he wouldn’t let go.</p><p>The men laughed cruelly, enjoying her helplessness. The sound of their mockery made her heart sink even deeper.</p><p>Then, suddenly, a voice broke through the chaos.</p><p>“You heard her right. Let her go. Now.”</p><p>The voice was calm but carried a deep, chilling authority.</p><p>They all turned toward the doorway, and there he was—Charles. Standing tall, silent, his face unreadable.</p><p>Natasha’s eyes widened with relief. She felt like she was looking at an angel descending into hell. For the first time that night, she felt a flicker of hope.</p><p>“Hey, man, who the hell are you?” one of the thugs shouted. “The shop’s closed! Get out before we smash your head too!”</p><p>Charles ignored the words completely. He stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the leader. “You heard me,” he said quietly but firmly. “Let the lady go.”</p><p>The leader laughed mockingly. “Huh? Who the hell do you think you are, talking to us like that? Do you even know who we are?” He spread his arms arrogantly. “We’re the Tiger Fangs gang. Does that ring a bell?”</p><p>He said it with pride, expecting Charles to cower. The Tiger Fangs were notorious around the area—brutal, fearless, untouchable. The police avoided their cases, and that was exactly why Natasha’s calls for help had gone unanswered.</p><p>But Charles’s expression didn’t change. He didn’t even blink. The name meant nothing to him.</p><p>“I don’t give a damn who you are,” he said coldly. “Let her go now.”</p><p>The leader’s smirk faded, replaced by irritation. “Then you must have a death wish. Guys, teach him a lesson.”</p><p>The ten thugs surrounded him, drawing their weapons—guns and knives gleaming under the dim light.</p><p>Natasha’s heart pounded faster. “Charles, please! They have guns!” she screamed.</p><p>But Charles didn’t move. He stood still, calm as a statue.</p><p>Then his eyes darkened, glowing faintly red.</p><p><em>{Eyes of Satan—activated.}</em></p><p>The thugs charged.</p><p>But in Charles’s vision, everything slowed down. He moved smoothly through them, weaving between the attackers like a shadow. One by one, he disarmed them, twisting knives out of their hands, kicking their ankles with precise, enough to nearly break their bones</p><p>To an observer, it was just a blur, like Charles flashed through them</p><p>Within seconds, all ten men were on the ground, groaning, clutching their legs and wrists, unable to move properly.</p><p>Natasha stood frozen, her eyes wide with disbelief. To her, it was like Charles had vanished and reappeared between heartbeats, and the next moment, everyone was down.</p><p>Charles now stood before the leader, who stared in shock, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</p><p>Charles dropped all the collected knives onto the floor in front of him. The sound echoed in the quiet room.</p><p>The leader’s mouth fell open. “Who… who the fuck are you?” he stammered.</p><p>“I won’t repeat it,” Charles said, his voice low and calm. “Let her go.”</p><p>The leader shoved Natasha aside, finally obeying, but in the same motion, he snatched a knife from his pocket and lunged at Charles.</p><p>Charles sidestepped easily. His expression didn’t even change. His eyes glowed brighter for a brief second as he activated his x-ray vision.</p><p>He saw it clearly—his cervical vertebra, one of the most delicate bones in the neck. Charles moved swiftly, touching his neck with a single precise motion and shifting the bone slightly.</p><p>The leader froze. His eyes widened as his body went stiff. His arms wouldn’t move. His legs wouldn’t move.</p><p>“What the—what the fuck did you do to me?!” he shouted, his voice trembling. “I can’t move! What did you do?!”</p><p>Charles stepped closer, his shadow covering the man completely. “I just shifted your cervical bone,” he said quietly. “The most vital and dangerous bone in the body. You know what happens when it’s misaligned?”</p><p>He leaned closer, his voice like ice. “It paralyzes you.”</p><p>The leader’s face drained of color, terror spreading through every inch of him.</p><p>“But don’t worry,” Charles said calmly, “right now it’s still reversible. If it’s not corrected in ten minutes, though… you’ll stay that way forever. Completely paralyzed. You’ll never move again.”</p><p>The leader’s eyes widened, his breathing quickening in panic. “Wh-what the fuck… please fix it! I’m sorry! Please forgive me! Correct it, please! I don’t want to be paralyzed for life!”</p><p>Charles smirked faintly, tilting his head. “Good. We’ll start with this—you’ll answer every question my lady asks you.”</p><p>The leader sniffled, terrified. “Yeah… yeah, I’ll answer everything. Please, be quick. The time’s ticking!”</p><p></p></div>
