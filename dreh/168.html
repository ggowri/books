        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div>Charles  stood, waiting for them to make way so they could leave. <br/>Tracy’s lips curled first. She was satisfied with what she was seeing. She put on a slow dirty smirk. <br/>“Well well,” she said, her voice light and cutting. “Look at this scene.”<br/>Collins let out a dry laugh and stepped forward. “Sister,” he said, eyes dragging over Serena. “Don’t tell me you have been drinking. Drunk in public.” He shook his head with mock disappointment. “Why do you keep being a shame to our… respectable family?”<br/>Serena straightened at once. She pulled away from Charles just enough to stand on her own. She didn't want to look drunk.<br/>“Whatever I do is none of your business.”<br/>Collins raised a brow. “Oh oh. It is.” He slid an arm around Tracy’s waist and pulled her close, squeezing her possessively. <br/>“Let me tell you something. With the support of my fiancée here, I have struck a deal with Mr. Damien.” He smiled wide. <br/>“And father has promised. I am now the CEO of the company. So yes, I have every right to be concerned about the family.”<br/>Serena scoffed. “Well, congratulations, brother.” She tilted her head slightly. “Let’s see if you actually have what it takes to run it.”<br/>Collins’ smile hardened. “I know I do. Stop acting all mighty.” His eyes flicked to Charles, then back to Serena.<br/> “Besides, my fiancée here will teach me well.” He hugged Tracy tighter. “Right?”<br/>Tracy smiled sweetly and pecked him on the cheek. “Of course.”<br/>Then Collins turned fully to Charles. His gaze was cold and amused.<br/>“Well,” he said, “seems like he is a bit useful to you. At least he hangs around. Loyal.” He smirked. “You can use him like your dog.”<br/>Serena snapped, “Brother. Respect yourself. Do not call him a dog.”<br/>Collins laughed. “You are still delusional. Still crazy about this no-future man.” His voice dropped, cruel. “The one that made father send you away from the house.” He leaned closer. “You are still not over him?”<br/>Serena’s jaw tightened.<br/>“You should be happy I compared him to a dog,” Collins continued. “He is less than that.” He turned to Tracy. “Right, honey?”<br/>Tracy smiled. Slow and poisonous.<br/>“Yeah,” she said softly. “He is a nobody. Just a gold digger.” Her eyes locked on Serena. “And he will ruin your life. Just like he did to mine.”<br/>Serena scoffed and gave Tracy a straight warning.<br/>“Okay,” she said. “Why don’t you both just shut up and go your way. Stop abusing my fiancée”<br/>They both burst out laughing.<br/>Collins shook his head slowly. “Listen to how you are saying it. Your fiancée.” He scoffed. “Someone who doesn’t even have what it takes to be a fiancée. You are here drunk because you regret your decision. You chose this stupid man over the family.”<br/>Serena’s fingers curled.<br/>Collins continued, enjoying every word. “But thank you for your stupidity. Because of it, I got my chance to prove myself. And now I am over you.”<br/>Tracy stepped forward, her smile sharp. “Completely over you.”<br/>Charles finally spoke, his voice calm. “Well, you both should enjoy it while you can.”<br/>Tracy laughed. “That’s what I hate about you, Charles. You always act like you have some secret wealth, like those stupid web novel stories.” Her eyes hardened. “But you don’t fucking have anything. This isn’t fiction. We will have nothing to regret.”<br/>She tilted her head. “You even knelt for a boy just to ask for transport fare.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “Okay. We shall see.”<br/>Tracy sneered. “If only you had listened to me back then and come back. Now look at you.” She glanced at Serena. “Stuck with a drunk fallen woman.”<br/>Serena snapped. “Who are you calling a fallen woman?”<br/>Tracy crossed her arms, arrogant. “You, of course. Look at you. You look pathetic.”<br/>Slap.<br/>The sound cracked through the air.<br/>Tracy staggered back, eyes wide. She raised her hand to strike back, but Serena caught her wrist mid-air and flung her aside. Tracy stumbled and nearly fell.<br/>Collins stepped forward, furious. “You—”<br/>Charles lifted a hand and smiled faintly. “Hey. Chill.” His eyes were cold. “It’s a lady fight. We don’t have to interfere. Do we?”<br/>Collins clenched his fists. Rage boiled in his eyes, but he stopped. He remembered that day. He remembered how Charles put him down, he could never handle him.<br/>Tracy straightened, shaking with anger. “You keep proving how horrible you are, Charles.” She pointed at them. “And I swear I won’t let this go easily. I will report this to the police. I swear.”<br/>Collins nodded sharply. “Yeah. We will call the police. Just wait for it”<br/>They turned and walked into the bar, the door swinging shut behind them.<br/>Charles looked at Serena. “Are you okay?”<br/>She nodded quickly. “Yeah. Yeah.” Her voice wobbled. “I just… I should go home and rest.”<br/>She took two steps and stumbled. The alcohol finally caught up with her.<br/>Charles caught her without a word. “You are not driving like this.”<br/>She did not argue. She only sighed and leaned into him.<br/>He drove her home while she murmured directions, her head resting against the window. It was a new apartment. Smaller. Quieter. Tucked between dull streetlights and narrow roads.<br/>When they arrived, he carried her upstairs.<br/>Inside, Charles paused. The place was clean. Decent. But it felt tight. Boxed in. Nothing like the wide glass walls and open air of her room in the Moretti building. This felt like a cage.<br/>He laid her gently on the bed and pulled the blanket over her shoulders.<br/>“I swear,” he said softly, “I will turn this around for you. Just you wait.”<br/>Serena smiled faintly, eyes half-lidded. “Thanks…” She swallowed, then looked at him. “But I need something from you now.”<br/>Charles frowned slightly. “What’s that?”.<br/>Serena’s eyes, hazy from the alcohol but sharpened by hurt, fixed on Charles. <br/>She pushed herself up on the bed, the blanket slipping from her shoulders. Her fingers moved to the buttons of her blouse, undoing them slowly, deliberately. <br/>The fabric parted, revealing the soft curve of her breasts, round, not large, but perfect.<br/>She stood, letting the blouse fall to the floor, then reached for the zipper of her skirt. “Let's have sex”.<br/>Charles froze. His throat tightened as he watched her step toward him.<br/>He swallowed hard. This wasn’t the right time.<br/>Just hours ago, he had been with Sapphire. Taking her virgin, that had granted him a surge of power. <br/>To sleep with Serena now, to take her virginity too, would just drain his energy and would be useless, unless he could fully stabilize and upgrade this level first.<br/>“Serena…” He raised a hand gently, stopping her advance. “Can we… do this another time?”<br/>“You’re rejecting me,” she said flatly. “Again.”<br/>“No, it’s not—”<br/>“I’m really stupid, aren’t I?” Her voice cracked. She laughed, bitter and sharp. “For choosing you over my family when we are  just in a … fake relationship.”<br/>Charles stepped closer, trying to soothe. “It’s not like that…I swear. We can do it tomorrow, or any day you want. Just… not tonight. Please.”<br/>Serena shook her head, tears glistening at the corners of her eyes. “Why not now? A hundred men would kill to have me. They beg for it. Why are you always different? Why do you always push me away when I need you?”<br/>Charles opened his mouth to explain, but the words tangled. How could he tell her about power levels?.<br/>“Just leave,” she said quietly, back to him. “Please. I want to be alone.”<br/>“But Serena—”<br/>“Leave. Now.”<br/>Charles stood there for a long moment, he sighed, respecting her wish.<br/>“…Okay.”<br/>He turned and walked to the door.</div>
