        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serena was obviously panicking in her voice. She couldn't form a sentence.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo;, Charles asked. Filled with concern.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m still at home,&rdquo; she said between shaky breaths. &ldquo;They are everywhere&hellip; police, family&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Charles said immediately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O-okay,&rdquo; Serena sniffed.</p><p>The call ended right then.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles lowered the phone slowly. By then, Lizzy and Natasha were already awake, sitting up in bed, the panic in his voice having pulled them out of sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Lizzy asked.</p><p>Charles told them everything. &ldquo;Serena&rsquo;s father is dead. Murdered.&rdquo;</p><p>Both of them froze.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Natasha breathed.</p><p>Charles nodded, &ldquo;Yeah, I have to be with Serena!&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;He washed up fast, dressed without wasting a second,&nbsp; and&nbsp; drove straight to the Moretti building.</p><p>By the time he arrived, the place was already crowded. Police cars blocked the entrance, officers moving in and out, neighbors gathering at a distance. Charles pushed through and entered.</p><p>Inside, the atmosphere was heavy. Family members stood in small groups, murmuring, they stared at him as soon as he entered with a disdainful look</p><p>&ldquo;Charles.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned.</p><p>Serena stood behind him, her eyes were pale and dry. The moment he faced her, she faltered. Charles closed the distance and held her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p><p>She nodded, barely. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;.yeah.&rdquo;. Obviously,&nbsp; she wasn't.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>She swallowed. &ldquo;They are still investigating. The police interviewed everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned. &ldquo;The Moretti estate has one of the highest security systems. How does someone get in and murder him without anyone noticing?&rdquo;</p><p>Serena shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;know...i&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, the bedroom door opened.</p><p>The lead officer stepped out, followed by two men pushing a stretcher. A white sheet covered the body.</p><p>The room erupted.</p><p>Family members rushed forward, voices overlapping.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he really dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>The officer raised a hand. &ldquo;As you already know, Mr. Moretti was brutally murdered. The case is being treated as homicide. Until further notice, the body will remain in police custody for further investigation.&rdquo;</p><p>Allison collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. &ldquo;Father&hellip; who could do this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The officer continued, &ldquo;We may need to contact any of you again. Please cooperate.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, they wheeled the stretcher away.</p><p>Serena stood still, watching as her father&rsquo;s body was taken out of the room. A man who had been alive just a few hours ago.</p><p>Allison was crying heavily, that many people were trying to console her. But Serena just stood still and cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind her, whispers started.</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even cry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was her favourite,&nbsp; yet she wouldn't even shed a tear for her.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, Mr. Gerald chimed in,&nbsp; &ldquo;She was already announced as the next CEO. With him gone, she rules without restraint.&rdquo;</p><p>Heads nodded.</p><p>Mr. Gerald added, &ldquo;We should be honest with ourselves. She gains everything from this. I&rsquo;m suspecting her&rdquo;</p><p>Serena turned slowly, disbelief written across her face. Her father just died and they were already forming conspiracy theories.</p><p>She just stared at them for a long moment, her face blank, before turning away without saying a word and walking toward her room.</p><p>Charles immediately followed.</p><p>The moment the door closed behind them, Serena&rsquo;s strength collapsed. Her shoulders shook as she turned and buried her face into Charles&rsquo;s chest, her hands gripping his shirt tightly as sobs finally broke free.</p><p>She had been holding it in. Every second. Trying to stay composed and strong in front of the family.&nbsp;</p><p>But she couldn't take it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How could someone do this?&rdquo; she cried between gasps. &ldquo;My father was nice to everyone in this family. He never treated anyone badly.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles held her firmly, one arm wrapped around her back, the other pressing her head gently against him. He understood what she was really saying.</p><p>The Moretti estate had one of the strongest security systems. Outsiders couldn&rsquo;t just walk in, kill the head of the family, and disappear without a trace. If the police hadn&rsquo;t identified anyone yet.</p><p>It was an inside job.</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s crying grew heavier. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo; she whispered brokenly. &ldquo;What will I do now?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles tightened his hold on her . &ldquo;You are not alone,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Everything will be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>He rested his chin lightly against her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. I will be by your side.&rdquo;</p><p>xxxx</p><p>Two weeks passed.</p><p>The police made no real progress.</p><p>There were very few CCTV cameras inside the house due to privacy concerns, and the little footage available showed nothing useful. Outside the estate, the cameras recorded no suspicious movement at the time of the murder. No outsiders. No forced entry or anything out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>The investigation dragged on with questions but no answers.</p><p>Eventually, the family requested the body for burial.</p><p>Serena found out only after everything had already been arranged.</p><p>No one informed her properly.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t even try to console her. When she heard that the burial preparations were complete, she was stunned, she believed proper investigation should be done before the funeral.&nbsp;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t confront anyone because she didn&rsquo;t have the strength.</p><p>The burial was quiet for a man of Mr. Moretti&rsquo;s stature.&nbsp; And with that, Mr. Moretti was finally laid to rest.</p><p>After the funeral, the family gathered in the grand room for a general meeting.</p><p>Everyone was present.</p><p>Even Collins.</p><p>The sight of him made Serena&rsquo;s fingers curl slowly at her side. He had been disowned by Mr. Moretti.&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment, she wanted to speak up, to question why he was even allowed in the room.</p><p>But she swallowed it down.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have the strength for any confrontation.</p><p>Beside Collins sat Tracy, calm and composed, her eyes quietly observing everyone in the room. Serena looked away.</p><p>Charles wasn&rsquo;t with her this time.</p><p>After a brief silence, Mr. Gerald stood up.</p><p>He cleared his throat and began with a solemn expression, offering his condolences, speaking about loss, unity, and how deeply everyone was affected by Mr. Moretti&rsquo;s passing.&nbsp;</p><p>Then his tone shifted.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since Mr. Moretti is gone, the family business must continue. We cannot allow emotions to stall progress. The Moretti Enterprises must keep moving.&rdquo;</p><p>Several people nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;With that,&rdquo; Mr. Gerald continued, &ldquo;we need a new leader immediately. To ensure stability, I, as the elder, have decided.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone showed full attention to the announcement.</p><p>&ldquo;I hereby appoint Collins as the new CEO of Moretti Enterprises,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;And I will assume the position of head of the family.&rdquo;</p><p>The room murmured in acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s head snapped up hearing this.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the heck?&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;Are you joking right now?&rdquo;</p></div>
