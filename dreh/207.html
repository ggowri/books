        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div><p>Charles froze mid-step, his breathing uneven as the echo of the voice faded through his head. </p><p>“Uh… did someone just say stop?” he muttered, lowering his hands slightly as he looked around. He didn&#x27;t see anyone and thought maybe he misheard. </p><p>He was about to go again and finish The monster up. </p><p>Then the voice came again.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t threatening. It was calm, carried on the air itself. </p><p>“Don’t kill them.” The gentle voice came again. </p><p>Charles turned slowly in a full circle, “Who said that?” he demanded. “Show yourself.”</p><p>“I’m in your head right now.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “My head?”</p><p> And as much as he hated to admit it, he could feel it. A faint vibration was going on in his head as they voice spoke.</p><p>“What are you doing?” he snapped. “Why are you telling me to stop? Those things nearly killed me.”</p><p>“You invaded their realm first,” the voice replied evenly. “You broke the rule. This land does not permit male existence.”</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw.</p><p>“They attack men because they believe men are destructive by nature,” the voice continued. “Mischievous. Greedy. Always talking. They were not hunting you. They were defending their home.”</p><p>Charles hesitated, the words sinking in despite himself. It was true. He had been warned no men were allowed here. He had come anyway.</p><p>“So what now?” He asked, “I am here searching for  the Kyoul Stone. And what if they wake up again?”</p><p>“I will guide you,” the voice said calmly. “I am the spirit of this realm. I will lead you to the Kyoul Stone, in exchange for sparing them.”</p><p>Charles blinked. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>For a moment, doubt flared in his mind. A realm spirit helping him sounded too convenient. Too risky. But then again, he didn’t have any better options. If the spirit was lying, he was already deep in trouble anyway and there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He exhaled slowly. “Alright,” he said. “Fine. Let’s do that.”</p><p>He glanced down at the two monsters, still groaning weakly, scorched and broken. “They are badly injured. They won’t die, right?”</p><p>“They will regenerate,” the spirit replied. “It will take time, but they will live.”</p><p>Charles nodded. “Okay. Good.”</p><p>He straightened, then paused. “So… what do I call you?”</p><p>A brief silence followed, then the voice answered, softer than before.</p><p>“Aries. Call me Aries.”</p><p>“Alright,” Charles said quietly. “Aries it is.”</p><p>He lifted his head and looked out at the endless plain. “So where do I go? I’m looking for the Kyoul Stone.”</p><p>Aries told him to keep walking toward the left and said the Kyoul Stone was inside Taunton Cave.</p><p>Charles nodded and turned in that direction, continuing forward while Aries guided him step by step.</p><p>As he walked, he checked his stomach and winced. Blood was still seeping from the wound the spider had given him. He frowned and asked, “So… will I be bleeding in my physical body too?”</p><p>“Yes,” Aries replied immediately. “That’s how mind journeying works.”</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw and pressed his hand against the wound, hoping they would reach the stone quickly before he weakened any further. Lizzypie and Natasha would be so worry mad by now.</p><p>After a while, the land ahead changed.</p><p>They arrived at a long stretch of desert.</p><p>Charles stopped at the sight of what he saw ahead.</p><p>In front of him were monsters. Too many to count. Different kinds. Bird-like monsters with sharp wings, massive lizard beasts, and some that even carried distorted human shapes. They filled the land ahead, spread out endlessly.</p><p>Charles swallowed hard.</p><p>Fuck… he thought. I was deceived.</p><p>There was no way he could fight all of them.</p><p>He stopped completely.</p><p>Aries spoke calmly. “Just go.”</p><p>Charles shook his head slightly. “You deceived me. You brought me here to be killed. I shouldn’t have trusted you.”</p><p>Aries scoffed. “You are funny. We had an agreement. We never break promises here. Just keep moving.”</p><p>As soon as she said that, the monsters slowly shifted. A narrow path opened between them, just wide enough for a single person to pass.</p><p>Charles gulped.</p><p>“Is this a trap?” he muttered.</p><p>But there was no turning back.</p><p>He walked forward carefully, every step tense, his eyes watching every movement around him. </p><p>The monsters stared at him, but none attacked. He passed between them, step by step, until he was completely through.</p><p>Only then did he breathe again.</p><p>“I already spoke to them,” Aries said. “So chill.”</p><p>Charles let out a breath. “Wow. Thanks”</p><p>He hesitated, then asked, “Has any human ever made it this far?”</p><p>“No,” Aries answered. “They never made it past the two border guards.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “The spider and the giant lizard?”</p><p>“Yes,” Aries replied. “So you are the first. You impressed me, I also lessened their power. That was the reason you were able to defeat them”.</p><p>Charles squeezed his face to this, “Uhn, why would you do that”.</p><p>“Because, you seem peaceful, before attacking them, you wanted to just ignore them. Even when they are attacking you, you just dodge before attacking them”. Aries said.</p><p>“Ohhh”, Charles nodded to this, he just did that out of impulse, and that&#x27;s what saved him and made this journey smooth.</p><p>The journey took only a few more steps before they arrived at the mouth of a cave.</p><p>Aries spoke. “This is it. Taunton Cave. The Kyoul Stone is inside.”</p><p>Charles stopped and looked at it. “Wow.” He honestly hadn’t expected it to be this close, or this straightforward, and for a moment he felt relieved.</p><p>But Aries continued, “Don’t relax yet. There are monsters guarding the Kyoul Stone. I have no authority over them. I can only speak to creatures of the outer land. Inner land doesn&#x27;t listen to me. I can only try to negotiate”</p><p>Charles swallowed. “So I have to fight my way through.”</p><p>“Yes,” Aries replied. “Be prepared.”</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly, “Okay,” he said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>He stepped into the cave.</p><p>At first, it was pitch dark. He couldn’t see anything at all and instinctively slowed his steps.</p><p>Then a soft light shone around him, illuminating the path ahead.</p><p>“Uh… is that you, Aries?” Charles asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Aries replied.</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. He hadn’t expected to find any kindness in this realm.</p><p>He kept walking deeper into the cave, then suddenly stopped.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Ahead of him was a shining diamond, resting atop what looked like an ancient stone tomb, glowing softly in the darkness.</p><p>Aries spoke with certainty. “That’s it. The Kyoul Stone.”</p><p>Charles blinked. “The Kyoul Stone is… a diamond?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So I can just walk up and take it?” Charles said, already stepping forward.</p><p>Aries didn’t even have time to respond.</p><p>“Hissssss—”</p><p>A massive shadow dropped down in front of them.</p><p>Three enormous heads rose into view, scales scraping against stone as a giant three-headed serpent blocked the path, its eyes locking onto Charles.</p><p></p></div>
