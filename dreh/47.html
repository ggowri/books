        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div><p>LizzyPie knew there was no way Charles could get out of the house alone. She had tried to stop him, but he was too determined. The only person that could help him now was the Godfather. But she didn’t want to call him herself and ask for help, because that would disqualify Charles from getting the inheritance. So she planned to make someone else call him, especially Serena.</p><p>Serena and Derek popped out their eyes at the mention of the name. They knew how powerful he was, and how rumors said he was even running the country. Of course, such a person could save Charles.</p><p>Serena asked flatly, “So, you think the Godfather can help us? He doesn’t even know us, and we are nothing to him. This doesn’t concern him. Also, how can we even contact him?”</p><p>LizzyPie shrugged. “Well, you can try. Who knows if he might help? Only if we find a way to contact him.”</p><p>Now Serena was lost, not knowing what to do. </p><p>Derek, typical of him, saw this as an opportunity to show himself off and act worthy. He bragged, “Ahhm, Godfather, right? My father knows him… him and my father have met a few times. I am sure he can help.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was stunned. They were startled and shocked. Mrs. Hailey faced him.</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>He saw the astonishment on their faces and decided to keep riding on it. “Yeah, yeah… they know each other, and I’m sure that with one call from him, he will be able to help.”</p><p>Serena frowned and looked at him suspiciously, then demanded, “Who is this father of yours? If he knows the Godfather and even talks with him, he must be a very popular person!”</p><p>Derek scoffed. “My father owns a company, Ronald of the Rox Enterprises. But he likes staying low key and hides his identity. He doesn’t love bragging, but he is a big person!”</p><p>The truth was, Derek’s father did have a company, but it was more of a shabby business, already fading and crumbling. And it was a lie that he knew the Godfather. Even though his father had some connections, the Godfather was far beyond his reach.</p><p>LizzyPie smirked, because she obviously knew he was lying. She had worked with the Godfather for many years, and he had never mentioned anyone named Ronald or Rox.</p><p>Serena, desperate to save Charles, asked him, “So call him and ask for his help. I will be very grateful!”</p><p>Derek’s eyes almost popped out hearing this. His gaze greedily swept over her pretty face—his false sense of pride swelled up as quickly as a penis. ”yeah, yes, of course.”</p><p>LizzyPie tilted her head, her eyes narrowing. “If your father is really associated with the Godfather, then tell me…what is his net worth?”</p><p>Derek scoffed, waving it off with a smirk.</p><p> “Very rich. In fact, I am living my father’s life also, keeping things coded. He doesn’t flaunt wealth like others, but trust me, he is extremely wealthy.”</p><p>LizzyPie chuckled softly and then brought out her phone. She tapped quickly, then turned the screen to face him. “Really? Because I just searched his company online.”</p><p>On the screen was the official record: Rox Enterprises — Net worth: 1 million dollars. Beside it were several articles with headlines screaming about the company’s downfall, bankruptcy rumors, and reports of collapse.</p><p>Derek’s jaw dropped. His face turned pale with shock. He quickly stammered, scrambling for another lie. “That… that is just the official net worth my father released to the public. There are many hidden assets he never disclosed. As for those nonsense articles about the company dying—that’s just a strategy, a way to trick competitors. Don’t believe everything you read, so pity you are pretty but not that smart”</p><p>He forced a laugh, trying to sound confident, but it only made him look more desperate. Still, he kept riding on his lies.</p><p>Serena folded her arms, her eyes sharp and suspicious. “Well, stop wasting time. Why don’t you call this father of yours for help?”</p><p>Derek pretended to be calm. “Of course I will, of course.” He then brought out his phone.</p><p> There’s something called a hollow lie. That’s when you brag foolishly for momentum without even thinking it through. That’s what was happening to Derek!</p><p>Derek’s face twitched. He had been bragging all this while, not even realizing he’d be asked to call his father in front of everyone. Panic slowly crept in, but he forced himself to keep cool.</p><p>Serena eyed him coldly. “What are you doing? Just call him already.”</p><p>He glanced up, his throat dry. He didn’t want to mess up the opportunity. Slowly, he tapped the screen and put the phone to his ear. It rang a few times, then someone picked up.</p><p>“Derek! Where the fuck have you been all this while? You left the company in ruin and ran away!” His father’s furious voice thundered from the other side.</p><p>Luckily, the call wasn’t on speaker. Derek let out a fake laugh, pretending nothing was wrong. “Father… you know the Godfather, right? Yeah… him. We need his help for a friend.”</p><p>On the other side, his father screamed, “What the fuck are you saying? Me? The Godfather? I’ve never even seen him before!, Are you drunk”</p><p>Derek’s eyes darted nervously, but he scoffed again and said lightly, “Yeah, yeah, I know you can do it. Listen…our friend is being held hostage by Tiger. The Godfather should call Tiger and stop him.”</p><p>There was a long pause, then his father roared in rage. “You bastard! Causing more trouble again?!, how do you want me to do that? Where are you!” His voice was full of disgust.</p><p>“Love you too Dad” he said and immediately hung up the call.</p><p>Derek lowered the phone slowly, then forced a smile. “You see? I have called him. You will see, something will happen now.”</p><p></p></div>
