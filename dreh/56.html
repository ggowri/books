        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div>Charles squinted, trying to make sense of the moaning echoing through the room.<br/>He stepped further in.<br/>“Mmm… Lizzypie already brought a man home?” he muttered under his breath.<br/>In the sitting room, Lizzypie was hunched over her laptop, completely absorbed.<br/>She didn’t even notice him entering.<br/>“Mmm, are you watching… porn?” Charles asked, his voice sharp enough to announce his presence.<br/>Lizzypie jerked her head up, startled.<br/>“Oh… you are back already. Or are you here to pack your things?”<br/>“Can you turn that down? It’s echoing all over the house,” Charles said, striding toward the screen.<br/>On the laptop was surveillance footage Lizzypie had set up inside the house at his request.<br/>And there they were Mrs. Hailey and Derek in the bedroom. Derek was inserting a long sex toy into Mrs. Hailey’s anus as she was tied to the bed, screaming in a mix of pain and pleasure.<br/>“Fuck, that’s disgusting,” Charles muttered, frowning.<br/>“It’s… hot,” Lizzypie said casually.<br/>“Disgusting,” Charles snapped back.<br/>Then he turned to the screen again, only to find himself slowly drawn in.<br/>The session was disturbingly intense.<br/>Derek was using several toys, long and dangerous-looking, on Mrs. Hailey.<br/>All of this was happening inside Tracy’s house.<br/>“Please, Derek… it’s your penis I want inside me!” Mrs. Hailey cried out shamelessly.<br/>Derek obliged, sliding into her from behind as he whipped her.<br/>Charles couldn’t believe they actually watched them until they came. It was insane.<br/>Both of them lay on the bed afterward, breathing hard. Derek untied Mrs. Hailey, and she laughed breathlessly.<br/>“Wow, that was peak. I never knew BDSM could be this good,” she said.<br/>Derek chuckled.<br/>“Yeah… but I can’t wait to do it with your daughter. She’s so damn stubborn.”<br/>“She will come around, Derek. You saved her life last night. She will be grateful—and she will see how much you’re worth.”<br/>Derek leaned back on the bed.<br/>“Talking of Tracy… you know I’ve fallen out of Mr. Morreti’s grace because of that useless Charles. And now Mr. Vasilios has cut ties with me too, all because of Charles again.<br/>I swear, I will kill that guy.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey nodded.<br/>“That man ruins everything wherever he goes.”<br/>Derek smirked faintly.<br/>“Yeah, but I recently struck gold with an overseas deal. There’s this company, a massive one called Roblox Enterprises.<br/>They are looking for private partners.<br/>Biggest in Switzerland. It’s hush-hush, only for exclusive investors.”<br/>“Really?”<br/>“Yeah. And you know what? It’s a guaranteed fifty percent profit within two months.<br/>Minimum investment: fifty million dollars.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey’s eyes widened.<br/>“Fifty percent? That’s huge. That would be a profit of fifty million in two months.”<br/>“Exactly,” Derek said with a lazy grin.<br/>“My father already profited from it.<br/>You’ll never hear about it publicly because it’s secret.<br/>I just want Tracy to take that same chance.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey rolled over, propping her chin on her hand.<br/>“This is really good. Tracy would be delighted to hear this. You can tell her about it.”<br/>Derek exhaled. “Tracy’s skeptical as hell.She wouldn’t believe me.But if you, her mother, talk to her, she will come around. I just want her to benefit from this. With this, her future’s secure.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey nodded slowly, a sly smile tugging at her lips.<br/>“You are right. Don’t worry, I will talk to her.<br/>That’s why I love you, Derek. You are perfect for my daughter… and perfect for me,” she said, stroking his cock.<br/>Derek grinned, his hand sliding back across her thigh.<br/>“Good. But first, let’s go for another round.”<br/>Lizzypie immediately slammed the laptop shut.<br/>Charles stood there, trying to make sense of what Derek had just said.<br/>“That was a scam, right?” he asked.<br/>“Yeah, probably,” Lizzypie replied.<br/>“I will look into it. But there’s no company that can pull that off…It’s impossible.”<br/>Charles sank onto the sofa.<br/>As Lizzypie walked toward him, he smiled, admiring her body.<br/>She had the kind of figure that demanded attention, while Serena had the face instead.<br/>“So, why are you back? I thought Serena said you two would be living together,” she asked softly.<br/>Charles recounted everything that had happened in the Moretti building.<br/>“That’s pretty bad,” Lizzypie said carefully.<br/>“If you don’t get engaged to Serena, it means your mission won’t be considered successful and your reward could be revoked.”<br/>Charles frowned.<br/>The reward he had gotten for winning the first mission was Lizzypie herself.<br/>“Does that mean… you will be taken away from me?” he snapped.<br/>Lizzypie threw her shoulder back with a small shrug.<br/>“Yes, of course.”<br/>Charles stared at her, stunned. This was crazy.<br/>He had bagged two of the prettiest women in the city—and now, he might lose both.<br/>“Ahh, I can’t afford to lose you,” he cried out.<br/>Lizzypie tilted her head, saying casually,<br/>“Well, that’s up to you.”<br/>Charles exhaled heavily, rubbing his temples. Thinking of any way possible.<br/>“I was bluffing,” he confessed. “About being able to solve the Moretti problem… and talking to Mr. Vasilios. It won’t be possible. Mr. Vasilios would never agree to just stop charging Mr. Moretti,  he earned a lot from them”<br/>He slumped back, lost in thought, trying to figure out what he could possibly do.<br/>Lizzypie watched him silently for a moment, then she smiled faintly.<br/>“Well,” she said, stepping closer. “I can think of a way Mr. Vasilios would listen to you no matter what.”</div>
