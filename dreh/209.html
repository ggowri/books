        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles gasped as he opened his eyes and his body nearly collapsed forward.</p><p>Natasha and Lizzy rushed in at the same time and caught him before he hit the ground, each grabbing one of his arms and holding him up.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Natasha screamed. &ldquo;Charles! Is everything alright?!&rdquo;</p><p>The entire hall was frozen.</p><p>Lord Hierem stared in disbelief. &ldquo;Did he just&hellip; survive the Hole Realm?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the elders leaned forward, eyes locked on Charles&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And that diamond&hellip; is that the Kyoul Stone?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles was still breathing hard, chest heaving like he had run for miles. Sweat soaked his face. For a moment he couldn&rsquo;t speak. Then his breathing slowly steadied.</p><p>Lizzy asked again, softer this time, &ldquo;Charles&hellip; are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded weakly. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha pulled back slightly to look at his body. &ldquo;You need treatment, you&rsquo;re blee&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped mid-sentence.</p><p>The blood was gone.</p><p>She stared at his stomach, then touched it, checking again. The wound had completely closed. The torn flesh was smooth, healed like it had never been cut.</p><p>Natasha&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Wow&hellip; you&rsquo;ve been healed!&rdquo;</p><p>Charles let out a small scoff and muttered under his breath, &ldquo;Thanks, Aries,&rdquo; knowing exactly who was responsible.</p><p>Lizzy frowned. &ldquo;Aries? Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Long story,&rdquo; Charles replied quietly.</p><p>Just then Lord Hierem stepped forward and shouted, &ldquo;Did you truly enter the Hole Realm and return&hellip; or have you been deceiving us this entire time?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles straightened slowly, standing on his own feet now, and smiled faintly.</p><p>Jeremy stared at him in shock before snapping, &ldquo;Yeah! He deceived us! Maybe he entered a different realm!&rdquo;</p><p>Another elder stepped forward and said, &ldquo;The Hole Realm is impossible for a man to enter and return from. You&rsquo;re deceiving us.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles lifted his hand calmly and showed them the diamond. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the Kyoul Stone you wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>The room fell silent as all eyes locked onto it.</p><p>Jeremy shook his head violently. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t believe this. And none of you should either. I swear this is all lies. We should never have allowed him to go!&rdquo;</p><p>Even Lord Hierem showed hesitation. Doubt flickered in his eyes before he turned and said, &ldquo;Chief priest. Check it.&rdquo;</p><p>An elder stepped forward slowly. Charles didn&rsquo;t release the stone, but the moment the chief priest came close, he stopped. His body stiffened. He could feel the energy radiating from it without touching it.</p><p>He stepped back immediately and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. It is.&rdquo;</p><p>A wave of murmurs filled the hall.</p><p>&ldquo;He must be something else&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell is he&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Hierem swallowed. Fear crept into his chest. For a man to enter that realm and return alive meant power beyond normal understanding. But he forced his expression back into control.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;hand it over, as promised.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles hesitated.</p><p>Aries&rsquo;s warning echoed in his head. The stone was dangerous in the wrong hands. The Hierem clan was definitely dangerous. He didn't want to let it go.</p><p>Lord Hierem&rsquo;s voice hardened. &ldquo;Remember. We had an agreement.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles gulped.</p><p>He had already promised. If he failed to honor it, Lizzy&rsquo;s Divine Oath would become binding again.&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly, he stretched his hand out.</p><p>Lord Hierem stepped forward immediately and took the stone from him.</p><p>As soon as Lord Hierem collected the stone, His eyes widened slightly as he felt the energy flowing from the Kyoul Stone, rich and overwhelming. Then a slow grin spread across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;With this,&rdquo; he said quietly, almost reverently, &ldquo;we will rule the cultivator world.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles stared at him without expression, but inside his mind he already made a vow to take it back.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to Lizzy. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s coming with me now. We are leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Hierem nodded without hesitation. &ldquo;Of course. You Can&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just let her leave! You promised she would marry me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was only if she entered the realm,&rdquo; Lord Hierem replied coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;Still!&rdquo; Jeremy barked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just let her go!&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy scoffed loudly. &ldquo;You must have had some wild fantasy in your head thinking you would fuck me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are a weak, pathetic virgin hiding under your father&rsquo;s wings, and you will stay that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s face twisted with rage. He stepped forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles stepped forward too.</p><p>Lord Hierem shouted, panic breaking through his voice, &ldquo;Jeremy! Back off right now!&rdquo;.</p><p>He was already scared of Charles.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy froze, trembling with anger and humiliation.</p><p>Lizzy spat at his feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She turned, and Charles and Natasha followed. The hall stayed silent as they walked out, every eye on them until the doors closed behind them.</p><p>One elder finally spoke. &ldquo;Who the hell is he?&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Hierem stared at the entrance, jaw tight. &ldquo;We are going to find out,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Because I do not want that man as an enemy.&rdquo;</p></div>
