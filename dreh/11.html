        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div>The next day, the fire was finally over, and the truck carried them back to the station.<br/>By the time it reached town, the truck was nearly empty, most people had gotten off along the way to reunite with their families.<br/>Charles was the last to exit, his steps slow and heavy.<br/>His strange demeanor caught John’s attention.<br/> “Charles, wait a sec,” John called out to him.<br/>“What’s up, John?” Charles asked.<br/>“Just… where’s your house again? I thought it was on our way. Why are you still in the truck?” John asked.<br/>“Ah yeah. But I had something to do before heading home” Charles said with a forced laugh.<br/>John didn’t push further. He just gave a tired smile and shook his head. “OKay, get home safely”.<br/>“Will do,” Charles replied.<br/>But instead of heading home, Charles went straight to the station dorm back. He washed his face, changed into fresh clothes, and packed his suitcase. <br/>He wasn’t ready to tell the team about his divorce, so staying in the dorms wasn’t an option anymore.<br/>He had no clue where to go next. Standing at the dorm entrance, suitcase in hand, Charles gazed at the familiar street outside. It should have felt comforting, he used to rush down this road, eager to see Tracy. Now it only felt empty.<br/>Five years of marriage, and though Charles’s status was nothing compared to Tracy’s wealth, he had invested nearly everything into their life together. With the divorce still pending, all his money was locked in joint accounts. He had almost nothing to his name.<br/>“Worst case, I will stay at a hotel for a few nights,” he muttered. “Once the divorce is settled and the assets are divided, I’ll figure out what’s next.”<br/>But before he could move, a sharp voice cut through the air.<br/>“Charles!”<br/>Startled, he looked up to see Tracy standing there, eyes blazing. She slammed her car door shut and strode toward him.<br/>“What are you doing here?” she snapped, her voice cold and commanding, slicing through the morning air.<br/>“Why shouldn’t I be here?” Charles asked, irritation creeping into his tone.<br/>“Because you tried to trick me!” Tracy shot back. “You know I live by Buddhist values and can’t stand liars. Why pull such a pathetic stunt?”<br/>Charles stared at her, genuinely confused. “What stunt?”<br/>“That goodbye letter you wrote,” she said, her voice dripping with scorn.<br/> “Wasn’t that a stunt? I know you will return home today. Were you at the wildfire site yesterday? Did you not see me, or were you avoiding me on purpose?”<br/>Her words came rapid-fire, mocking and accusing.<br/>“Charles, did you think faking your death would make me break? Make me care about you again? Maybe pick you over Francis? He’s just a little kid, for God’s sake. Why do you see him as a rival?”<br/>She gave a harsh laugh. “Keep dreaming. That will never happen. I can easily find out if you are lying and bluffing”.<br/>Last night, Tracy had returned to Derek and Francis’s warmth, but her mind had been consumed by Charles. <br/>When Mr. Zoe confirmed he was alive that morning, relief flooded her. But relief quickly curdled into rage.<br/>If Charles was alive, why hadn’t he called? Why was his phone still off? Surrounded by all those firefighters, was he too busy to even charge it?.<br/>She became convinced he had staged a cruel deception, so she could feel bad. <br/>“Tracy, are you done?” Charles asked flatly. “If you are finished, leave. I didn’t lie to you. Everything in that letter was true. I don’t care what you think of me…it doesn’t matter. Just stay away from me. Stop playing with my emotions.”<br/>He met her furious, self-righteous glare with calm indifference. After everything that had happened, did she really think there was anything left between them? The condoms, the hotels, her audacity was jaw dropping.<br/>Tracy faltered, her anger dimming into sudden panic. “You are serious?” she whispered.<br/>“Yes. You cheated on me. You never apologized. You still choose them over me. And you think we’d still have something together?” Charles’s voice hardened.<br/>“If you are done, I have something else to do.” He turned to leave.<br/>But Tracy grabbed his arm, her grip trembling. “Wait… are you really saying you’re done with me? That you can live your life without me? You… You are a poor man! You will need me!” she shouted desperately.<br/>Charles just stared at her. Why was she doing this? She clearly didn’t want him gone, yet she clung to her arrogance. What did she see him as, a fool?<br/>“I will repeat it. I am sincerely done with you. How is that a problem?” Charles said firmly.<br/>Tracy scoffed, folding her arms. “Okay then. Let’s meet at court in two days. Once we are there, you will realize it’s finally over. You better rethink this before you regret it!” she screamed.<br/>“In two days? Fine. I will see you in court,” Charles said coolly.<br/>Tracy sneered. “You are the most foolish man I’ve ever met. You think life is that easy? Because I pampered you, treated you well, you think you can survive without me? You will suffer if you leave me!”<br/>Charles’s voice was sharp and final. “I would rather suffer in poverty than stay trapped with a double-edged sword like you. That’s the greater suffering.”<br/>He jerked free from her grip, turned his back, and walked away.</div>
