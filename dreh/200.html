        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles pressed for more information about the Hierem clan, and Rain listed how cruel they were known to be, and willing to use any means, including their strange powers, to maintain dominance.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, thanks, Rain,&rdquo; Charles said, showing his appreciation before hanging up.</p><p>Without wasting a moment, he returned to the hotel, changed his clothes, and made his way to Ashtown.</p><p>He was about to enter the car when he saw Natasha hurrying toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo; she asked curiously, concern written all over her face.</p><p>Charles told her what he&rsquo;d learned&mdash;that Lizzy was in Ashtown and he was on his way there right now. Natasha immediately asked to tag along.</p><p>At first, Charles refused. Who knew what the Hierem clan might do? Since they were cultivators, they could display some kind of power&mdash;and that would expose Natasha to a side of the world she knew nothing about. He didn&rsquo;t want to put her in danger.</p><p>But Natasha kept pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knows&mdash;you might need assistance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can help. Please, Charles.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to waste any more time arguing. With a reluctant nod, he agreed.</p><p>And so they made their way to Ashtown together. It was a full six-hour journey. They had to stop a couple of times to rest and refuel.</p><p>Charles sat behind the wheel, anxious, his mind racing. What could Lizzy possibly be doing there? What danger might she be in.</p><p>They arrived in Ashtown.</p><p>The moment they stepped out of the car, the atmosphere felt wrong.</p><p>Charles stopped a passerby and asked about the Hierem clan. The man stiffened. His eyes darted around before he shook his head and hurried away without a word.&nbsp;</p><p>Another woman reacted the same way. A shop owner froze mid-movement, then muttered that he didn&rsquo;t know anything and shut his door.</p><p>Again and again, fear answered them before. It took a while before they saw someone with courage to answer them.&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha let out a breath. &ldquo;Who are these Hierem clan people? Folks are scared to even point in a direction.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering the same thing. But we&rsquo;re about to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>A few minutes later, they arrived at the destination.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hierem Empire.</p><p>It was massive. Too massive. White stone walls stretched wide, polished and imposing. For a second one could think this was the white house.</p><p>At the entrance stood a towering iron gate. Around it were armed men, nearly twenty of them, spread out in a disciplined formation.</p><p>Natasha whispered, &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Their car slowed and came to a stop before the gate.</p><p>Instantly, the guards snapped to attention. Metal clicked as they raised their guns and&nbsp; aimed straight at them.</p><p>A sharp voice rang out. &ldquo;Whoever you are, open the doors and step out gently, or we will shoot immediately. I repeat, get out slowly with your hands raised. Do not try anything funny.&rdquo;</p><p>The man who spoke lifted his hand slightly, a signal telling others to shoot if they detect any funny movement.</p><p>Charles opened his door first. He stepped out carefully, lifting his hands just as instructed. Natasha followed, her hands raised high.</p><p>The leader&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he walked closer. &ldquo;Who the fuck are you, and what are you doing here?&rdquo; he barked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone who comes here must clear their name with security and have an appointment. If you don&rsquo;t, turn around and leave now.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles stayed calm. His hands remained raised.</p><p>&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for my friend.&rdquo;</p><p>The leader&rsquo;s brows pulled together.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles met his stare.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She,&rdquo; Charles said. &ldquo;Lizzypie. She came here recently.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment the name left his mouth, the leader&rsquo;s posture shifted. Just slightly. A flicker in his eyes.</p><p>Charles caught it.</p><p>The leader recovered fast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone by that name. Turn around and leave. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;You definitely know her. I&rsquo;m not here to cause trouble. I just want to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>The leader&rsquo;s voice hardened. &ldquo;Do you even know where the hell you are? This is Hierem domain. You do as you&rsquo;re told. Turn back and leave.&rdquo;</p><p>He took a step closer. &ldquo;If you want entry, get a pass from a Hierem family member.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, leave. Right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles shook his head. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not leaving until I meet Lizzypie.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence dropped as they were amused.&nbsp;</p><p>The leader raised his hand slowly. &ldquo;This is your last warning. We will kill you, and nothing will happen. Turn back. In count of 3&rdquo;</p><p>His fingers curled.</p><p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha&rsquo;s breath hitched. Her hands trembled. The other men tightened their grip, fingers ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Two.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could say three&hellip;</p><p>[Flash movement activated.]</p><p>In a blink, Charles vanished.</p><p>The leader felt a cold press against his head.</p><p>Charles was already behind him, arm locked around his neck, the same gun in his hand a moment ago now aimed at his skull.</p><p>With that, the other men reacted instantly. Guns swung toward Charles from every direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm,&rdquo; Charles said evenly. &ldquo;Act funny, and he dies.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha stood frozen. Her mind hadn&rsquo;t caught up yet. One second Charles was in front of her, the next he was behind the leader. Too fast and felt impossible.</p><p>She was still staring when several men closed in around her as they pointed guns at her in every direction.</p><p>The leader smirked despite the gun at his head. &ldquo;You should have thought before you acted. Do anything to me, and they kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s jaw tightened. &ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m not here to cause trouble. I just want to meet Lizzypie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I refused,&rdquo; the man snapped. &ldquo;Yo are feeling brave because you have some kind of power. But don&rsquo;t get it wrong. Every one of us has one.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice dropped. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t survive if we all go against you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned slightly. If that were true, this man wouldn&rsquo;t still be trapped in his hand. If he could break free, he would have done it already. Instead, he was struggling. He was obviously bluffing.&nbsp;</p><p>The leader&rsquo;s tone turned ugly. &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we will release your bitch too. Kill me and they kill her also&rdquo;</p></div>
