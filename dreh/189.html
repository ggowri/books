        <div><p>Sapphire cleared her throat and spoke again, her tone icy.</p><p>“That’s exactly my point,” she said. “You don’t even know who he is. You don’t know whether he’s someone important or someone even wealthier than me, yet you stupidly looked down on them.”</p><p>Jude swallowed hard, sweat forming at his temple.</p><p>Collins, however, refused to let it go. He scoffed and snapped, “I’m telling you, he’s just a poor motherfucker.”</p><p>Sapphire’s head turned slowly.</p><p>Her glare was sharp enough to slice skin.</p><p>Tracy reacted instantly, grabbing Collins’ arm and pulling him back. “Enough,” she whispered urgently. “Stop talking.”</p><p>Jude turned back toward Sapphire, his voice breaking. “Please, ma’am. Forgive me. I beg you.”</p><p>Sapphire shook her head calmly. “No,” she said. “I’m not the one you should be pleading with.”</p><p>She lifted her hand and pointed directly at Serena and Charles.</p><p>Jude didn’t hesitate.</p><p>He dropped to the floor again and crawled toward them, his dignity completely gone. “Please,” he said desperately. “I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry. Forgive me. I was wrong.”</p><p>Serena’s expression hardened.</p><p>She took a step back. “You are apologizing because your boss arrived,” she said coldly. “Not because you knew you were wrong. You almost had my legs broken.”</p><p>She shook her head. “No. I’m not accepting your apology.”</p><p>Jude’s face crumpled as he begged harder, voice shaking, hands pressed to the floor.</p><p>Serena didn’t move and stayed on the ground that he must be punished.</p><p>Sapphire watched quietly, then spoke. “It seems they don’t want to forgive you.”</p><p>Jude’s heart dropped.</p><p>“So here’s my decision,” Sapphire continued calmly. “You will be removed from the position of COO and reassigned as a sales manager.”</p><p>Jude’s eyes widened.</p><p>“And before that,” she added, “you will be suspended for six months.”</p><p>His eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. “No… no, please, boss. Please forgive me. Sales manager???. Six month suspension?. How am i going to survive”</p><p>Sapphire’s voice turned colder. “You should be grateful I didn’t sack you entirely. You are good at your job. That’s why I made you COO in the first place.”</p><p>She took a step closer. “But you let personal feelings blind you. I’m using this as a lesson.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “If you dare beg again, I will sack you on the spot.”</p><p>Jude froze. He shut his mouth immediately, fear sealing it tight.</p><p>Then Sapphire turned away from him and faced the reception desk.</p><p>“Quincy,” she said calmly.</p><p> “I saw your bravery today. You took it upon yourself to correct an injustice even when you knew it could cost you your job. With people like you, this company will keep moving forward.”</p><p>Quincy just stood there, frozen.</p><p>Sapphire continued calmly, “Because of what you did, I’m appointing you as the new COO. Your salary will be one million dollars.”</p><p>The lobby sucked in a collective breath.</p><p>Quincy’s eyes widened, her mind struggling to catch up. Just moments ago, she was an ordinary receptionist earning a hundred thousand dollars, standing on the edge of being sacked. Now her entire life was shifting right in front of her.</p><p>“Boss…” she whispered, stunned. “Really. You’re making me the COO.”</p><p>“Yes,” Sapphire replied without hesitation. “Not only because of your courage today. I have reviewed your file before. I checked your résumé. You excelled in business studies, consistently. I expect you to do well.”</p><p>Quincy’s knees buckled.</p><p>She dropped down immediately, overwhelmed. “This… this is unbelievable,” she said, her voice shaking. “Thank you so much. I’m so grateful. Truly grateful.”</p><p>Sapphire gave a small nod. “Stand up. You have earned it.”</p><p>Across the lobby, Jude watched everything unfold, his face hollow. Just minutes ago, he had stood there shouting, threatening to sack Quincy with absolute confidence. Now she stood far above him, while he knelt in disgrace.</p><p>That’s life.</p><p>Whispers spread among the employees, awe and admiration filling the air.</p><p>“Ms. Sapphire is incredible.”</p><p>“She really rewards good deeds.”</p><p>“She’s unbelievable.”</p><p>Just as the tension began to settle, Linda, Collins, and Tracy slowly started edging toward the exit, their heads lowered, eager to escape the embarrassment now that they knew the deal was completely off the table.</p><p>They were almost at the door when Sapphire’s voice cut through the lobby.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re all going?”</p><p>They froze.</p><p>Linda turned first, irritation flashing across her face. “What? Can’t we leave now.”</p><p>Sapphire’s gaze was calm but unyielding. “You can,” she said. “After you go down on your knees and apologize to them.”</p><p>She pointed toward Charles and Serena.</p><p>Linda’s eyes widened. “What? Why should we kneel? For what exactly.”</p><p>Sapphire replied evenly, “You slandered them. You treated them badly. You humiliated them. So you will kneel and apologize.”</p><p>Tracy and Collins swallowed hard, their throats dry.</p><p>Linda scoffed loudly. “What the hell. We abused them, so what. That doesn’t even warrant arrest.”</p><p>Sapphire smiled faintly, a dangerous kind of smile. “Let me explain something to you very clearly. I am extremely influential here in Winchester. With just one call, the police will arrive and arrest you without listening to a single word you have to say.”</p><p>Linda’s face stiffened. She gulped. “Isn’t that power abuse?”</p><p>Sapphire tilted her head slightly. “Oh. Now you understand what power abuse means. You didn’t seem to understand it when you were abusing them.”</p><p>Her voice hardened. “Kneel. And apologize. Now.”</p><p>The weight of the room pressed down on them.</p><p>Tracy couldn’t take it anymore. She was the first to bend, her knees hitting the floor as she lowered her head. Collins followed a second later, his face burning with humiliation as he knelt beside her.</p><p>All eyes turned to Linda.</p><p>Slowly and unwillingly, she bent also.</p><p>Her knees hit the marble with a dull sound.</p><p>Collins and Tracy stiffened beside her, humiliation burning through their chests.</p><p>“We are sorry,” Linda muttered, her voice low and bitter. “We were wrong for what we did.”</p><p>Sapphire didn’t react.</p><p>She tilted her head slightly. “I can’t hear you. What about the both of you also!”</p><p>Linda’s hands tightened into fists as she swallowed her pride. Then they raised their voice.</p><p>“We’re sorry, we were wrong. We shouldn’t have treated you like that.”</p><p>Collins and Tracy&#x27;s voices  were shaky and strained.</p><p>Collins and Tracy felt like the ground should open up and swallow them whole as dozens of eyes watched.</p><p>Sapphire finally nodded once, satisfied. Serena was deeply moved by this, but found something suspicious. </p><p></p></div>
