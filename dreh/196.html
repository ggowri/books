        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div><p>Charles gulped and asked quietly, “What kind of meditation is that?”</p><p>Lizzypie shook her head. “That isn’t meditation. It’s mind journeying.”</p><p>“Uhn?” Charles frowned. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“It’s different,” she explained. “With mind journeying, the cultivator enters another realm to retrieve divine power. Their mind leaves this world and fights in another. Spirits. Monsters. Realm guardians. If they win, they gain the power of that realm.”</p><p>Charles swallowed, he was full with many questions. “And if they fail?”</p><p>Lizzypie’s expression darkened. “Mind journeying is dangerous. If you get injured there, you’re injured here. If you die there, you die physically as well. Some realms are dark. People die often attempting it.”</p><p>Charles sighed slowly. Since the journey began, everything he heard felt unreal, heavy, far beyond anything he had imagined.</p><p>They sat down and waited for Mr. Noh to finish. </p><p>Minutes passed.</p><p>Then suddenly, Father Noh’s eyes snapped open.</p><p>He exhaled deeply and the flames around him faded, cooling into nothing. He slowly stood and looked at Lizzypie.</p><p>“You told me you would stop doing this,” she said sharply, looking so worried. “What if you fail one day?”</p><p>Father Noh scoffed. “Then that is my fate. I enjoy mind journeying. It is exciting.”</p><p>Charles was surprised. How could he find something that terrifying, exciting.</p><p>Lizzypie scoffed and bowed.</p><p>Father Noh nodded, then his eyes moved to Charles. Charles stepped forward and bowed as well.</p><p>“You must be his son,” Father Noh said.</p><p>Charles raised his head, confused. “His son? What do you mean? You know my father?”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Father Noh replied calmly. “Your father and your grandfather both trained under me. I am their thier master.”</p><p>“What?” Charles blurted out. “Then what do you know about my father? How did he die?”</p><p>Father Noh waved his hand. “That is not why you are here.”</p><p>Charles tried to speak again, but Lizzypie stopped him with a sharp look.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>Father Noh stepped closer and stared at him “Son, you have many journeys ahead of you. Difficult ones.”</p><p>Charles frowned, unsure of what he meant.</p><p>“You came here to strengthen yourself,” Father Noh continued. “So let us see if your body can endure it. Come closer.”</p><p>Charles obeyed.</p><p>Father Noh picked up a thin wooden stick and lightly touched it to Charles’s stomach.</p><p>“Uhn—!”</p><p>Pain exploded through Charles’s body. His vision spun as he staggered back and vomited blood onto the floor.</p><p>Splash!!!</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Father Noh watched him closely as he  nodded slowly, almost disappointed. “So weak.”</p><p>Charles clenched his stomach, still gasping. “How… how did just a touch do that?”</p><p>“You couldn’t even defeat a high-class cultivator like this,” Mr. Noh said calmly. “That stick only revealed it. We can’t begin the strengthening at your current level.”</p><p>“But I have fought powerful people before,” Charles said, struggling to stand straight. He did fight with sir jim and blade. He won. </p><p>Mr. Noh shook his head. “Those were low-class. And you must have struggled even then.”</p><p>Charles froze.</p><p>If Blade was low-class, then that meant the real enemies were on an entirely different level.</p><p>Lizzypie broke the silence. “So what’s next?”</p><p>Mr. Noh turned away. “He needs more external power first. Upgrade his abilities slightly, and strengthen his physical body. I heard he has Eyes of Satan Power. Let him reach at least level 7 with it, and come back .”</p><p>He glanced back at Charles. “When that is done, return here. He will be more than  ready.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded in understanding.</p><p>They spoke about a few other things,  before leaving the temple.</p><p>As they walked away, Charles felt hollow. Disappointed. </p><p>In the car, Lizzypie noticed his expression. “Don’t think too much,” she said. “Focus on gemstone meditation. Unlock more power. That’s what matters now.”</p><p>Charles leaned back. “I’m already at stage four. When will I be ready?”</p><p>“Obviously after three more levels,” she replied.</p><p>Charles sighed deeply.</p><p>Three levels meant time. It meant searching. Aside from Serena, he had no other virgin. </p><p>And what if he encountered the Trisian Syndicate or the Kora Family before then?</p><p>---</p><p>After a quiet journey, they arrived home.</p><p>They stepped out of the car and were about to head inside when Charles’s phone rang. He checked the screen.</p><p>Natasha.</p><p>He answered immediately. “Hello, Nat.”</p><p>Her voice came through, panicked and rushed. “Please come to the store. Some crazy people are here.”</p><p>“What?” Charles said sharply. “What do they want?”</p><p>“They said they want to buy the store,” Natasha replied. “I refused, but they won’t leave.”</p><p>Charles exhaled hard. “Okay. I will be there in a moment.”</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>“Who was that?” Lizzypie asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Charles said quickly. “I will be back.”</p><p>“But—” Lizzypie started, looking so concerned. “There’s something I need to tell you.”</p><p>“Can it wait?” Charles said as he turned back toward the car. “I will really be back.”</p><p>Before she could say anything else, he jumped in, started the engine, and sped off.</p><p>Lizzypie stood there watching the car disappear down the road. She let out a slow breath, her chest heavy.</p><p>Because that would be the last time she would ever see him.</p><p></p></div>
