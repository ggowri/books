        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div>Charles couldn’t believe what he just heard.<br/>His entire face squeezed in rage as he stepped closer to them.<br/>“Don’t you dare lie to me,” he roared, voice shaking the room.<br/>Reaper and Hazard dropped even lower to the ground, trembling uncontrollably.<br/>“We are not lying!!” Reaper shouted, voice cracking.<br/>“We swear—!! It was Mr. Damien!! He ordered it!! Paid us upfront!!”<br/>Hazard nodded violently, almost crying.<br/>“Yes!! He even told us where Serena would be!! He planned everything!!”<br/>Charles’s eyes widened in disbelief.<br/>Mr. Damien…Serena’s uncle.<br/>The same man who was with them acted heartbroken, pretending to care about Serena,  accusing Charles, shouting that Charles was the cause of the attack.<br/>He was the one paying assassins to kill her.<br/>Charles clenched his jaw so hard his teeth hurt. <br/>He inhaled slowly, and then turned to rain. <br/>“I want each of them to have at least two fingers broken. That’s their punishment.”<br/>Both thugs gasped in horror.<br/>“No, no please—!!”<br/>“Please sir, spare us!!”<br/>Charles ignored them.<br/>“But don’t kill them,” he added firmly. “I want them alive. They will work for me from now on. Also, please collect necessary proof that Mr. Damien sent them”<br/>Rain gave a small bow. “As you wish, Young Master.”<br/>Before Charles even turned away, Rain asked, “Serena’s men… Are they okay ”<br/>“We rescued them,” Rain said. “They are outside. Safe. Waiting.”<br/>Charles nodded once.<br/>“Good.”<br/>He turned and started walking out of the room.<br/>And right as he reached the exit—<br/>“YAAAAAAA!!!”<br/>A sharp scream of agony ripped through the air, followed by the sickening. CRACK!!<br/>And then another CRACK!!<br/>****<br/>“What… my uncle sent them?” Serena hollered. Her vision was still hazy as she just came back to consciousness on the hospital bed. Her voice was weak but sharp with shock.<br/>Charles and Fred were standing beside her bed. Charles nodded.<br/>“Yes. He sent them. I heard it directly from them.”<br/>Serena’s eyes widened in disbelief.<br/>“All this time, I thought it was my opposition… or even worse, Collins. But why would my uncle do that? He loved me!. After my Dad, he is the only person that cares for me in that family…. Is there proof?”<br/>Charles replied immediately.<br/>“Yeah. There are payment receipts… and messages he sent to them.”<br/>Serena still stared, stunned.<br/>She couldn’t wrap her head around it.<br/>Fred leaned forward.<br/>“Ma, I think you should rest. We will handle the rest. You were shot in the shoulder.”<br/>Serena touched her shoulder lightly and muttered, “Yeah… that’s crazy. I’m not even feeling any pain. I even forgot there was a wound there. I thought I would die.”<br/>Fred shook his head.<br/>“The doctor can’t even explain it. The bullet should have hit your heart, and you should be dead. But somehow, it only grazed past. But still, you should be careful.”<br/>Charles stayed silent, eyes lowered.<br/>He knew exactly why she wasn’t feeling pain.<br/>Rain’s potion. Worked like magic. <br/>Serena turned to him.<br/>“Are you okay?”<br/>“Yeah,” he answered. Then added quietly, “Next time, don’t do that stupid thing.”<br/>Serena’s face dropped.<br/>“Stupid thing by saving you?”<br/>Fred exploded.<br/>“How dare you call Miss Serena stupid!”<br/>Charles replied calmly, “She took the bullet instead of me. She used herself as a shield.”<br/>Fred’s voice cracked.<br/>“She is really stupid for that! Who does that!?”<br/>Serena scowled.<br/>“I’m your boss!, you are calling me stupid”<br/>Fred sighed but didn’t back down.<br/>“How could you do that? You could’ve died. For him!”<br/>Serena looked away.<br/>She knew Fred cared about her.<br/>“Let’s just leave this for now,” she muttered. Then she looked between them.<br/>“I heard Rain, the Godfather’s man saved us. How did he even know we were there? Who called him?”<br/>She turned her eyes sharply to Charles.<br/>“Do you know anything about this?”<br/>Before Charles could speak, Fred cut in quickly.<br/>“How would someone like him know the Godfather? Impossible. I met Rain myself outside, he said he was doing some operations around there, and that’s what brought him at the right time.”<br/>Serena frowned. That explanation was too convenient and hard to be just coincidence. It didn’t sit right with her. But for now… it was the only explanation anyone was giving her and the one that made sense.<br/>Serena swung her legs off the hospital bed, ignoring the IV still tapped to her hand.<br/>Fred’s eyes widened.<br/>“Miss Serena! What are you doing?”<br/>She stood firmly.<br/>“Get ready. We are meeting my uncle today.”<br/>Fred stepped forward, blocking her path.<br/>“What? You nearly got killed just a few hours ago. Don’t stress yourself. We will do this tomorrow.”<br/>Serena shook her head sharply.<br/>“No. If we wait, he’ll sense something is wrong and run. And like I said—” she raised her arm high, showing how steady she looked, “I feel totally fine.”<br/>Fred exhaled deeply, defeated.<br/>“I will gather all the men.”<br/>“No,” Serena said. “Just a few. I don’t want to attract attention, or let my dad hear anything for now. Maybe… just maybe… This is a misunderstanding. I need to confront him first.”<br/>Fred clenched his jaw.He didn’t like this.<br/>But Serena was his boss and stubborn as stone.<br/>“…Fine,” he muttered reluctantly.<br/>Minutes later, they left the hospital quietly.<br/>[AT MR. DAMIEN’S HOUSE]<br/>They arrived at Mr. Damien’s home, a quiet place on the outskirts of the city, He lived alone. Serena stepped out of the car first.<br/>“Fred, keep the men outside,” she ordered. “Only you and Charles will come in with me. If anything goes wrong, I will signal.”<br/>“Yes, ma’am.”<br/>“And both of you,” she added, looking at Charles and Fred, “we simply enter like nothing happened”<br/>They both nodded. Serena pushed open the door and stepped inside.<br/>The living room was quiet, with warm lights, polished furniture, and the faint smell of tea.<br/>And there, sitting comfortably on a sofa was Mr. Damien, and beside him was a woman.<br/>Charles’ eyes widened instantly.<br/>He recognized her on sight.<br/>Natasha.</div>
