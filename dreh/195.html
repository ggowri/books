        <h1>Chapter 195</h1>
        <div><p>Charles was confused about what it could be as he immediately turned on his phone and switched to the news.</p><p>He was expecting bad news, but it was completely the opposite.</p><p>The reporter announced that the Godfather had revealed plans to begin a massive project: the construction of a refinery and a mining company. It would be the first of its kind in the city, and the project would be headed by his grandson.</p><p>The announcement was made through Rain, as the Godfather himself did not appear due to security concerns.</p><p>The reporter then added that chaos had erupted across the city. People were stunned, not just by the scale of the multi-billion project, but by the revelation that the Godfather even had a grandson. More shocking was the fact that this mysterious grandson would be the one leading it all.</p><p>Charles stared at the screen, his heart racing. This matched the dream he and Lizzypie had been planning for all along. </p><p>He didn’t hesitate. He called her immediately.</p><p>“Wow,” Charles said the moment she picked up. “That’s crazy.”</p><p>Lizzypie laughed softly on the other end. “That’s your reward for finishing the third mission.”</p><p>Charles went silent for a second. “Really?”</p><p>“The Godfather asked me what your dream was,” she continued. “I told him everything. He listened, then said he would sponsor it. All of it.”</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly, overwhelmed. “Really? I’m… I’m so grateful.”</p><p>“There’s more,” Lizzypie said. “He said I should take you somewhere.”</p><p>“Where?” Charles asked.</p><p>“You will know when we get there.”</p><p>Charles smiled,  “I’m already on my way.” Then he immediately instructed the driver to be quick. He was so happy. </p><p>—--</p><p>As expected, that day turned into pure chaos in the business world. The revelation of the Godfather’s grandson sent shockwaves everywhere. </p><p>Executives, investors, and power brokers all wanted one thing: to meet him. A new project of that scale meant partnerships, alliances, and influence. Simply standing beside him would be a blessing.</p><p>When Charles arrived at the hotel, Lizzypie was already outside waiting.</p><p>He walked up to her. “So where is this place?”</p><p>She opened the driver’s door and got in. “Enter.”</p><p>Charles got into the passenger seat. As the engine started and the car pulled away, he asked again, “Where exactly are we going?”</p><p>“Somewhere to strengthen your power,” she replied.</p><p>Charles frowned. “Strengthen? Aren’t I strong enough?”</p><p>She scoffed lightly. “You are. But only against ordinary people without power. Not other cultivators.”</p><p>Charles turned to her. “Cultivators?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said calmly. “Your body has limits. If you keep upgrading abilities without strengthening yourself and learning how to use that power properly, you will fail the moment you face someone stronger.”</p><p>Charles went quiet. He knew she was right. From the X-ray vision to the laser beams, every time he pushed too far, exhaustion followed. His power drained him faster than he liked to admit.</p><p>He nodded slowly.</p><p>Lizzypie continued, “The Godfather wants you strengthened before you encounter the Trisian Syndicate and the Kora Family.”</p><p>The name alone made Charles sit up straighter.</p><p>Charles frowned slightly. “Who are they? I’ve never heard of them before.”</p><p>Lizzypie scoffed. “Yeah, and that’s because they operate in other nations. But the Trisian Syndicate is back in the city.”</p><p>Charles turned toward her fully.</p><p>“They are on the same level as godfather” she continued. “In fact, both the Trisian Syndicate and the Kora Family control empires bigger than his. And their cultivators are far more numerous and more ruthless.”</p><p>Charles let out a slow breath. “Really? I always thought my grandfather was the most powerful man in this city.”</p><p>“He is,” Lizzypie said. “One of them.”</p><p>She kept driving, her eyes fixed on the road. “The reason the Godfather’s influence stands above the others isn’t just power. While they use their strength for personal gain, he did the opposite. He fought in the nation’s wars. Protected the country. Won countless battles when no one else could.”</p><p>Charles listened closely.</p><p>“That’s why the president values him,” she added. “That is also the reason  the people respect him. His name carries weight beyond fear, also, he obviously has more influence”</p><p>She paused, then her tone hardened. “But the other two are different. They are more vicious. More ambitious. And in terms of raw power, they are terrifying.”</p><p>Lizzypie glanced at Charles. “Now that the Trisian Syndicate is back in the city, you will cross paths with them often. And if you are not strong enough…”</p><p>She didn’t finish the sentence.</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw. “Then I have to become stronger.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Much stronger.”</p><p>Charles felt more motivated than ever.</p><p>The drive stretched on for hours. The road grew rough. The journey became hectic, silent. By the time they reached the outskirts of the city, it was already late in the afternoon. </p><p>They parked and got down.</p><p>Without a word, Lizzypie led him into a narrow path cutting through thick bushes. Branches scraped against their clothes as they walked deeper, until the city noise completely vanished. </p><p>At the end of the path stood an old temple, weathered and quiet, yet powerful in its presence.</p><p>Inside, dozens of people were training. Practicing martial arts, it was like those shaolin temples. The moment they noticed Lizzypie, they stopped and bowed.</p><p>Lizzypie turned to one of them. “Where’s Father Noh?”</p><p>“The power room,” the man replied respectfully.</p><p>She nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>She walked on without hesitation. Charles followed closely behind.</p><p>They entered a dim chamber lit entirely by candles. . In the center of the room sat a very old man. His white hair covered most of his face, his body thin yet unmoving, like stone.</p><p>He was meditating.</p><p>A visible aura surrounded him. Flames burned around his body, not touching him, not consuming him. Just existing and alive.</p><p>Charles swallowed hard.</p><p></p></div>
