        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div><p>The room stayed quiet for a moment after Collins left.</p><p>Then Serena spoke.</p><p>“Everything we do from this point forward,” she said evenly, “will not interfere with my father’s investigation. It will continue until the killer is found. We will capture him.”</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>“Well,” Serena added, “this meeting is over.”</p><p>Slowly, everyone stood somberly.</p><p>This was not what they had expected when the meeting was called. The power had completely shifted.</p><p>Mr. Gerald was the first to storm out, his face tight with frustration. One by one, the others followed, leaving the room empty.</p><p>Mr. Valentino stepped closer to Serena.</p><p>“The board will be pleased to have you as CEO,” he said. “I always knew you were capable.”</p><p>Serena nodded. “Thank you. I appreciate that.”</p><p>She also thanked Jimmy for his assistance . After a brief conversation, both men left the room.</p><p>Only Serena and Charles remained.</p><p>Serena stood there for a moment, then walked toward him and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>“I’m so grateful,” she said quietly. “I don’t even know what to say.”</p><p>She pulled back slightly. “How did you get the document?”</p><p>Charles took out his phone and handed it to her.</p><p>On the screen was a message sent the night Mr. Moretti died.</p><p>[The document is in the toilet roof. Protect Serena.]</p><p>Serena stared at it, reading it again.</p><p>“My father sent this to you?” she asked.</p><p>Charles nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>Serena swallowed. “That means… he knew he was about to be killed.”</p><p>Charles nodded again. Blaming himself “If  only I had seen the message sooner, I would have suspected something.”</p><p>Serena frowned. “If he knew, why didn’t he call me? Or shout for help? He knew basic self-defense. He didn’t even fight back.”</p><p>Charles hesitated, then said, “That would only make sense if the killer was someone close to him. Someone he was emotionally attached to. Someone he didn’t want to fight.”</p><p>Serena cursed under her breath.</p><p>Because that pointed to only one person.</p><p>“Collins,” she said quietly. “That bastard really killed my father.”</p><p>Charles shook his head slightly. “Most likely. But we can’t say anything for sure yet.”</p><p>Serena’s eyes filled.</p><p>“The Moretti family was once one of the most influential families,” she said. “Collins destroyed everything because of the CEO position he was never capable of holding.”</p><p>She wiped her face and straightened.</p><p>“I will do anything,” Serena said firmly, “to have him arrested and exposed.”</p><p>Charles looked at her seriously. “You need to be careful. He threatened to kill you. I’m sure he isn’t bluffing.”</p><p>Serena scoffed. “That’s nothing. I’m waiting for him.”</p><p>Charles shook his head slightly. This was the cold Serena he had first met.</p><p>She was about to speak when Charles’s phone vibrated.</p><p>He checked the screen. It was Natasha.</p><p>He answered. “Natasha?”</p><p>Her voice came through panicked. “They’re back.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “Who?”</p><p>“The men from the other day,” she said quickly. “The Trisian gang or whatever they’re called. And the young master—Raphael—is here.”</p><p>Charles raised his brow. “I will be there right now!!!”</p><p>“Be quick,” Natasha said. “He’s also waiting for you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Charles replied. “On my way.”</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>The Trisian gang—the ones who had been insisting on buying Natasha’s store for one billion—were back. </p><p>He knew this wouldn’t be easy. Lizzy had already warned him about them.</p><p>Serena noticed his expression. “What is it?” she asked.</p><p>“I have to go somewhere,” Charles said. “Will you be okay by yourself?”</p><p>Serena didn’t want him to leave. Not because she was scared, but because she wanted him around. She didn’t say it loud though.</p><p>She smiled instead. “Of course.”</p><p>“Call me if anything happens,” Charles said.</p><p>“I will,” Serena replied.</p><p>Charles nodded, said his goodbye, and rushed out of the room.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside a moving car, Collins slammed his fist against the seat.</p><p>“Fuck!” he shouted. “I didn’t ask you to kill my father. I said cripple him. Just cripple him. Why did you go that far?”</p><p>The thug beside him, a man with tinted hair, turned sharply. “Yo, what the fuck are you saying? We didn’t even carry out the operation.”</p><p>Collins froze. “What?”</p><p>“We never met your father,” the thug said. “We were still mapping the best way to approach him. You told us to wait. What are </p><p>you talking about?”</p><p>Collins’ throat went dry.</p><p>“You… you didn’t see him at all?”</p><p>“No,” the thug replied. “Not even close. We haven&#x27;t done anything yet ”</p><p>Collins swallowed hard.</p><p>So it wasn’t the gang he sent that killed his father. </p><p>His hands clenched slowly.</p><p>“I knew it,” he muttered. “I fucking knew it.”</p><p>His eyes darkened as he leaned back in the seat.</p><p>“That fucker Serena did it.”</p><p></p></div>
