        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div><p>CHAPTER 167</p><p>As soon as Charles released, his Eyes of Satan power immediately upgraded, and the blue dashboard showed in front of him.</p><p>Big bold letters appeared, pulsing with dark red energy</p><p>[EYES OF SATAN - POWER UPGRADE COMPLETE]</p><p>[Current Level: 4]  </p><p>[New Ability Unlocked: Hellfire Beam]</p><p>Below it, a short note about the power  glowed</p><p>[Hellfire Beam Shoot concentrated beams of pure demonic fire from your eyes. </p><p> Speed: 5,000 mph (covers 100 miles in 72 seconds)  </p><p> Range: Up to 10 miles with perfect accuracy  </p><p> Control: Beam goes exactly where you look. Thin laser or wide blast.  </p><p>Heat: Burns flesh, melts steel, sears the soul. Fire sticks and keeps burning until you stop it.  </p><p> Special: You can focus it narrow enough to hit a single spot  without killing the target instantly.</p><p>Percentage: 40% for now, which means, it would take 60 seconds cooling break for interval]</p><p>Charles blinked hard. The dashboard vanished, but he could feel the power now. He put on a smile. </p><p>That was like superman Power, also, 100 miles in 72 secs, that was very fast, like very fast, if he used it wisely, he could be able to even destroy that assassin.</p><p> He put on a smile. Also, all he needed was just some gem power with meditation to raise the percentage.  He already got some leftover Gem Stone he could use. </p><p>Sapphire could notice him and said, “So… you have got a new power, how is it”.</p><p>Charles faced him with a big smile, “Yay, it&#x27;s a very good one. I could really defeat the assassin”.</p><p>Sapphire&#x27;s face was full of happiness,  and delightful that she could be of help.</p><p>“Wow, that&#x27;s great… I&#x27;m so happy, since you got the power, let&#x27;s go again”. She said and already on Charles, ready to ride him again.</p><p>“What… really, you want to go again?” Charles was surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, actually, I don’t know sex can be this sweet, I want more… I love the feeling”, Without even waiting, she started stroking his cock again.</p><p>[The next morning].</p><p>After they both had their hot session, they slept off. Only for both of them to wake up the next morning. </p><p>They had gone four rounds before they finally stopped,  and it turned out Sapphire was a sex demon. She kept demanding more.</p><p>Even when they woke up, she asked for one round, which Charles immediately refused as he quickly dressed up and walked out.</p><p>Sapphire also dressed and followed him, as they walked out, they saw that the room was already filled with Tina, and Amara, with lizzypie.</p><p>Tina and Amara looked at them with some sly faces.</p><p>Tina waved sweetly. “Good morning, Aunt Sapphire. Good morning, Uncle Charles.”</p><p>Amara copied her, voice dripping with fake innocence. “Yeah, good morning, Uncle. Do you both sleep well?”</p><p>Sapphire’s cheeks went red. “Hey, good morning, girls. Uh… sorry I didn’t tell you yesterday. I went to collect something in Winchester.”</p><p>Lizzypie snorted loud. “Yeah, that’s why you’re just coming out of his room this morning. Winchester.”</p><p>Tina giggled. “Thanks, Uncle Charles, for finally bringing my aunt back to life.” She winked. “She looks way more alive now.”</p><p>Amara leaned forward. “Hope you treated her real good, Uncle. She is kinda inexperienced.”</p><p>Sapphire’s face burned hotter. “Hey! Girls, it’s not what you think!”</p><p>Lizzypie laughed. “It’s exactly what they think.&quot;</p><p>Charles rubbed his neck, an awkward smile on his face. “Lizzy… They are teens.”</p><p>Lizzypie shrugged. “Okay, fine. Just so you could know, we hear you all night. ”</p><p>Tina stuck her tongue out. “Is not something to be ashamed off ”</p><p>Amara nodded. “It’s totally okay ”</p><p>Sapphire covered her face with both hands. “Oh my God, stop! You are not supposed to be saying something like that”</p><p>Charles cleared his throat, trying to change the topic fast. “So… what are you all doing up so early?”</p><p>Lizzypie’s smirk faded into serious mode. “While you two were busy enjoying the moment, me and the girls were working. We met with Paul, to expose him and the real incident of what happened that day.”</p><p>Charles sat down quickly. “Wait—what? You met Paul? With the girls”</p><p>Sapphire’s eyes widened. “What?! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you tell me? It’s dangerous! What if he hurt you both?”</p><p>She turned to Lizzypie, angry. “You can’t just use them like that!”</p><p>Lizzypie raised her hands. “Relax. As you can see, they are fine.”</p><p>Charles sighed and decided to cool things off. “Okay, Lizzy… next time, give us a heads-up.”</p><p>Lizzypie grinned again. “A heads-up? While you two were busy fucking.”</p><p>Tina and Amara burst out laughing.</p><p>Charles puffed out, he couldn&#x27;t understand lizzypie, she was sounding jealous, and that was very unlike of her.</p><p>He decided to just let it go and said, “So, tell us… what did you find?”.</p><p>“This..”, Lizzypie turned the laptop to Charles and Lizzypie,  they saw the video and popped out their eyes. This video was enough to destroy Paul&#x27;s life. </p><p>Charles glued to the video evidence in front of him, when his phone suddenly beeped. It was a message from Serena.</p><p>He checked it.</p><p>(Please,  I&#x27;m drunk…come and take me home. I&#x27;m at Allen bar).</p><p>Charles sighed. He understood that Serena was having a hard time because of Paul&#x27;s video. He excused himself and left for the bar before things got worse. </p><p>Getting there, he found Serena at one of the tables, she was very drunk, and yet still downing a cup of alcohol.</p><p>Charles crossed the room in long steps and took the glass from Serena’s hand before she could tip it again.</p><p>She squinted up at him, pupils unfocused, then laughed softly. “Wow. Look who’s here. My handsome, amazing fiancé. He finally came for me.”</p><p>Charles exhaled through his nose. Serena was always composed. Sharp and Controlled. Seeing her like this was depressing. The video had broken her harder than she wanted to admit. She always acted strong but weak inside. </p><p>“Stand up,” he said calmly. “We are going home.”</p><p>She slammed her palm on the table. “Yeah!!! My fiancé who wouldn’t even let me fuck him is suddenly asking us to go home.” She laughed louder. “Maybe today is the day.”</p><p>This caught everyone&#x27;s attention. Someone near the bar had already started recording.</p><p>Charles reacted instantly. He stepped in close and covered her face with his hand, lowering his voice. “Stop it. You are hurting yourself. You have too much to lose like this. Please. Let’s just go home.”</p><p>She tried to pull away but her balance failed her. He caught her before she fell, lifted her slightly, and guided her toward the exit. People whispered as they passed. </p><p>They were almost outside when the door swung inward.</p><p>Charles looked up.</p><p>Tracy stood there, frozen, her eyes moving from Serena’s flushed face to Charles’ arm around her waist. Behind her was Collins.</p></div>
