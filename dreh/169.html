        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div>The door closed softly behind him.<br/>Charles made his way back home. On his way his chest tightened<br/>‘Why did I do that?’<br/>Rejecting Serena because of power levels. Because of upgrades and cooldowns. It sounded ugly when he faced it head-on. Like he was keeping her close only for convenience. For his own benefit. <br/>Guilt settled deep in his stomach.<br/>By the time he got back to the hotel, it was already late.  He opened the door to the room and stopped short.<br/>Tina and Amara were crying. Not quiet tears. Real ones. Tina’s shoulders shook while Amara wiped her face again and again. Lizzypie stood between them, arms wrapped around both girls, trying to calm them down. Sapphire was beside them, telling them it would be okay.<br/>Charles’ heart dropped. “What happened?”<br/>Tina broke free and ran to him, grabbing his shirt. “Uncle Charles. Please. You have to help us.”<br/>He groaned softly and crouched to her level. “Hey. Slow down. What really happened?”<br/>Amara sniffed and spoke, her voice trembling. “Our friend has gone missing. For two days now. We just got a call asking if she is with us.” She shook her head. “She isn’t.”<br/>Tina wiped her tears angrily. “Something bad might have happened to her.”<br/>Charles exhaled and forced his voice to calm. “Girls. Please calm down.” He placed a hand on each of their shoulders. “She’s missing, yes. But people go missing and get found all the time. The authorities will do their job. She might even be okay.”<br/>Sapphire nodded quickly. “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell them. She might just be with her boyfriend.”<br/>Tina shook her head hard. “No. Vera doesn’t have a boyfriend. That’s not what this is.”<br/>He looked at them carefully. “Do you have any idea what might have happened?”<br/>Tina and Amara exchanged a look. They hesitated.<br/>Then Tina swallowed and said quietly, “Vera has been telling us something.”<br/>Charles leaned forward. “What kind of something?”<br/>She took a breath. “She said some men had been following her. In secret.”<br/>Amara nodded. “Wherever she goes. School. Streets. Even when she changes routes.”<br/>Charles’ voice dropped. “Someone followed her around?”<br/>Tina nodded hard. “Yeah.”<br/>She hesitated, then added, “And what makes us really worried is that she said the men are Mr. Damien’s men.”<br/>Lizzypie stiffened. “Mr. Damien?”<br/>“Yeah,” Amara said quietly. “Those men are kind of popular. Everyone knows them. They act like they own the city.”<br/>Charles frowned.<br/>Again. Every evil rotten thing somehow curved back to the same name. Mr. Damien. It was almost impressive how often he surfaced whenever something ugly happened. He really ought to die.<br/>Charles straightened, his expression settling into something firm and cold. “Okay.”<br/>Everyone looked at him.<br/>“I will handle this,” he said. “Lizzypie and I will go to Winchester tomorrow. We’ll investigate properly.”<br/>Tina’s eyes lit up. “Really?”<br/>“Yes,” he said without hesitation. “If Mr. Damien’s men are involved, we will find out.”<br/>Sapphire looked uneasy, and said, “What?. Winchester Again?. Mr. Damien would kill you this time”. She was worried.<br/>Lizzypie teased her, “Lover girl, we will be okay, just look at your nieces”.<br/>Sapphire sniffed and said, “Thanks. I'm grateful for your help”.<br/>The next morning came fast.<br/>Charles and Lizzypie made their way out while the city was still half asleep. Sapphire stood by the door and watched them leave, her arms folded, worry clear on her face until the car disappeared down the road.<br/>On the highway to Winchester, silence filled the car for a while.<br/>Then Lizzypie sighed loudly. “You really fucked her into loving you.” She glanced sideways at him. “She’s madly in love. Like Serena.”<br/>Charles kept his eyes on the road.<br/> Lizzypie continued, “just that you haven’t fucked Serena yet. Have you?”<br/>Charles sighed. “No.”<br/>Lizzypie clicked her tongue. “Figures.”<br/>He glanced at her. “You are acting strange around Sapphire.”<br/>She raised a brow. “Strange how?”<br/>“Like you’re attacking her,” he said. “Are you jealous?”<br/>Lizzypie burst out laughing. Loud and sharp. “Jealous? Why would I be?” She waved a hand. “I don’t care if you fuck every woman in this world.”<br/>“Then why do you keep going at her?”<br/>She smirked. “Because I like teasing you. And teasing her. She is pretty and cute ” Her eyes glittered. “It’s fun.”<br/>Charles nodded slowly, accepting it.<br/>Lizzypie turned fully toward him. “Either way, I don’t care which lady you fuck.” She leaned back in her seat. “As long as I’m your first wife. Remember?”<br/>Charles chuckled and shook his head. “Yeah.” He nodded. “You are my first wife.”<br/>Lizzypie smiled as Winchester’s skyline began to rise ahead of them. Charles looked at lizzypie. She wasn't really jealous but that didn't erase her acting strange. <br/>They arrived in Winchester before noon.<br/>Based on what the girls had told them, they traced Vera’s usual routes. School streets. Side roads. Bus stops. Small shops. Lizzypie worked on the CCTV cameras.<br/>The men were real.<br/>On several CCTV clips, the same two black cars appeared again and again. Always at a distance. Following Vera everywhere.<br/>Charles’ jaw tightened. “They took her.”<br/>Lizzypie nodded. “Highly likely”.<br/>“We trace the men, not the girl. They will lead us to her.”<br/>They decided to wait for them at CHENG Enterprises.<br/>They waited across the street, since evening.  <br/>Late into the night, the doors opened.<br/>The same men stepped out. They got into a gray van and drove off.<br/>Charles started the engine. “That’s them.”<br/>They followed at a distance, never too close, and never too far.<br/>The van left the city and headed toward the coast.<br/>When it finally stopped, they were already at a silent sea port. It was so quiet. <br/>Charles killed the engine and they got out.<br/>Charles crouched behind a stack of crates with lizzypie and lifted a long-range camera. He zoomed.<br/>The men walked to a container near the water. One unlocked it and the doors creaked open.<br/>Charles’ breath stopped.<br/>Inside were girls. Several. Like almost over 200 girls. <br/>Lined up, their hands bound and mouths taped. <br/>Charles whispered,  “What the fuck!”.</div>
