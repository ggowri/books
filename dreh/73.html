        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div><p>Charles was shaking hands with everyone, smiling politely, while Serena stood beside him, quietly whispering names into his ear. He didn’t know most of them.</p><p>Diana was the most excited of all. “Your husband must be the luckiest man alive! He just won the Sapphire Stone yesterday, and now the Netheris Stone this week? He’s officially a billionaire!” She laughed, holding Serena’s hand. “Wow, girl, you always make the right choices.”</p><p>Charles nodded modestly as people congratulated him. If he sold the stones—or even displayed them—he’d easily become one of the richest men in the city.</p><p>Then, a familiar voice called out.</p><p>“You never cease to amaze me.”</p><p>It was Natasha. She walked right up to him and gave him a tight hug. Serena blinked, unsure how to react, while Lizzie watched in silence.</p><p>“Are you just lucky,” Natasha teased, “or is there always something about you—like you already know what the stone contains?”</p><p>Charles only smiled.</p><p>Serena finally spoke. “Wait… you both know each other?” She knew Natasha too—everyone in their circle did. Both women were popular in their own ways.</p><p>Natasha grinned. “Of course. He bought that sapphire-yellow stone from my shop. And now—he’s my biggest shareholder.”</p><p>Serena smiled faintly. “Oh. That’s… great.”</p><p>Before the awkward air could settle, another voice cut in.</p><p>“Another woman for your collection?”</p><p>It was Tracy—her tone sharp, her eyes aimed at Natasha. Jealousy leaked through every word.</p><p>Charles sighed. “And why do you care?”</p><p>Tracy scoffed. “I don’t. I’m actually happy for you. Seems you’re not useless after all. Just do me a favor—don’t disturb Derek again. Leave him alone.”</p><p>Charles’ smile vanished. He wondered what lies Derek had been feeding her—just like old times. She always believed Derek was the saint, and he was the villain.</p><p>“I don’t care what Derek tells you,” Charles said coldly. “I’m out of your life. Stay out of mine.”</p><p>“Because you’re rich now? You think you can play with women and get away with it? You’ll get your reality check soon,” she hissed before storming off.</p><p>What she didn’t know—was that she would be the one to face reality soon.</p><p>After she left, Serena turned to him. “What are you going to do with the stone?”</p><p>“I’d advise you to sell it,” she said softly. “It’ll save you from stress—and thieves.”</p><p>But Charles shook his head. “I’m not selling it. And I won’t display it either.”</p><p>Serena and Natasha exchanged surprised looks. If he wouldn’t sell or show it, then what was he planning to do?</p><p>Hours passed. Guests began leaving one by one. Serena reminded him before she left, “Don’t forget the bet you vowed to win. The deadline’s close—you must win.”</p><p>When only a few remained, Lizzie stepped closer to Charles. “You caught me off guard there,” she said with a smirk. “I was wondering where you will see billions to get the stone. Turns out it was just bait, you made Norman waste his money on nothing. Smart move.”</p><p>Charles gave a proud smile. Lizzie took the stone and examined it under the light. “Now, we just have to grind it. Then we will make the cure.”</p><p>He felt a pang of guilt. Using the stone as medicine would destroy it—something worth billions. But he had no choice.</p><p>They walked out of the hall toward the car. The wind was sharp, cutting through the night.</p><p>On the sidewalk stood Tracy, hugging herself, waiting for a taxi. The cold bit hard at her skin.</p><p>Charles paused. Despite everything, he felt a shred of pity. He walked over. “Where is your car? And where is Derek?”</p><p>Tracy glared at him. “I know you are just trying to mock me. It’s none of your business.”</p><p>Charles sighed. “It’s late and freezing. Let us drop you off.” He gestured toward their car.</p><p>Charles’ offer only made Tracy take it as an insult. She snapped, “See? I was never wrong about you. This is who you are — stop flaunting your new riches at me. Stop mocking me. I hate you. Leave me alone. I am, not getting in that car with your … your whore.”</p><p>Charles shrugged. “You are impossible, and again, don’t call her whore!e” he said, then left her standing. He climbed into the car with Lizzie and they drove off.</p><p>Tracy stayed on the curb, stunned. She had come with Derek in her own car, but Derek had driven off with it — without telling her. She told herself there must be a reason. She waited for a taxi that never came. No rides showed on her app; no driver replied. Regret tightened around her like an old coat for not following Charles.</p><p>Just then, she saw Norman across the street, she saw this as an opportunity to beg him for a ride, it was seriously freezing here. </p><p>Just as she followed him, and was about to call his name. Norman, who stood alone in a dim corner, pressed the phone against his ear. Tracy hurried over, mouth already forming his name — then froze at what she heard.</p><p>“Yeah,” Norman was saying, in a very low whispering voice. “I want you to take care of him and bring me the stone”.</p><p>What!. She instantly knew who he was referring to.</p><p>“Yeah… he is quite handy and knows how to fight. So,  hit him and ram him off the road. Make it look like a hit-and-run.  Make it quick and clean.”</p><p>Tracy’s blood went cold. As she heard this, Norman was really trying to assassinate Charles. To avoid being caught she quickly stormed away. Her heart was beating very fast. Just then, a taxi came by. She immediately stopped it and drove off. She could still hear Norman’s voice in her head.</p><p>Maybe Charles needed to be taught a lesson after all, she told herself. “I don’t care, we already divorce anyway and he is always stepping on my nerves, I don’t care if he dies!”</p><p></p></div>
