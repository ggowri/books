        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div>“You think crying fixes anything?” Norman sneered, shoving his soiled shoe toward her. “You made the mess. Now get down there and lick it clean.”<br/>The family members watched in horror, but no one dared to speak up. Offending Norman was not an option.<br/>Even Charles, who was meeting him for the first time, could see the man was nothing but a vile, entitled bully.<br/>“Are you deaf or just stupid?!” Norman bellowed, his eyes leering at the maid’s chest. He was practically salivating at the thought of her kneeling before him.<br/>Trembling, the maid began to sink to her knees.<br/>But before she could kneel fully, a firm hand caught her arm, pulling her upright.<br/>It was Serena.<br/>“Leave it,” she said firmly.<br/>The maid froze, looking terrified. Norman lifted his head, fury flashing in his eyes, but when he saw Serena, he swallowed his rage.<br/>“Beauty,” he said, forcing a smile, “we have to teach people like her a lesson. They are beneath us… lowlifes. Next time she will be careful not to step on people like us.”<br/>Serena gave him a cold, disgusted look. “Is this the man you want me to marry?” she asked, turning to her father. “This absolute piece of trash?”<br/>Norman scoffed and tried to recover. “My lady, I am sorry if I offended you. I was only drawing some boundaries. Please, forgive me.”<br/>Serena crossed her arms. “You are exactly what people say,  a spoiled brat who knows nothing about life beyond arrogance, pride, and womanizing.”<br/>His face twisted in anger. For a moment, he lifted his hand as if to strike her, then caught himself, forcing a smile. “No, my lady. Perhaps we started on the wrong foot. But maybe this will change your mind.”<br/>He pulled out a small box and opened it to reveal a dazzling diamond ring. “This cost one million dollars,” he bragged. “No one else can offer something like this, the most expensive jewelry you will ever encounter. It’s one of a kind — a gift for you.”<br/>Serena scoffed. “Still bragging, even while offering a gift? I don’t want it.”<br/>The room fell silent. Norman blinked, stunned.<br/>“You are rejecting a one-million-dollar ring? Are you insane?” Collins exclaimed, his voice echoing through the hall. Murmurs spread across the room.<br/>Mr. Moretti finally spoke up, his tone heavy. “Serena, you should accept the ring. Since you will be getting engaged to him anyway, you can at least start from there.”<br/>Serena shouted again,<br/>“Father,” she said, “I will say this again… I am not getting engaged to him. I want Charles. Only Charles.”<br/>Gasps rippled across the room. Then, to everyone’s shock, she slipped her arm under Charles’s, drawing him closer. He stiffened, startled, his breath catching at the sudden attention. Serena was really taking this fake thing to the next level. <br/>Norman blinked, confused. “Wait, this guy?” he said, pointing. “Isn’t he the firefighter everyone’s been gossiping about? The delivery man they said you were seeing? Please tell me that’s a lie.”<br/>Serena met his stare,  “No. It is not a lie. We are already engaged. So you can move on and find another woman to impress.”<br/>Norman let out a short, bitter laugh. “You must be under some kind of spell, Beauty. This man is nothing, absolutely nothing! He can never give you the life you deserve. He is a poor man living off rich women. Everyone knows who he is around town. He will only embarrass you!”<br/>Serena’s eyes hardened. “And yet,” she said, “I still want him.”<br/>Norman frowned, shaking his head. “Look at what I’m offering you.  A one-million-dollar ring for just an engagement! What has he ever given you? I bet he hasn’t even—”<br/>Serena cut him off, a faint smirk touching her lips. “You must be blind. Or deaf.”<br/>Then she raised her hand. The sapphire on her finger sparkled. “Look at this,” she said. “A two-million-dollar ring. From him.”<br/>The entire hall fell silent.<br/>Norman’s eyes widened as he leaned forward, staring at the eight-carat sapphire glittering on her hand. His throat tightened.<br/>Two million. For a man like Charles, that wasn’t just extravagant,  it was impossible.<br/>He blinked again, searching for an explanation. Who the hell is he?<br/>Still, pride wouldn’t let him show it. He scoffed, forcing a laugh.<br/> “That’s obviously fake! Or worse, stolen! He is probably some petty criminal. People have pictures of him working as a hotel attendant, so there is no way he would afford this. Don’t fool yourself, Serena… he’s a nobody.”<br/>Collins crossed his arms, nodding sharply. “Yeah, I have been saying this from the start. I just hope this nonsense doesn’t end up ruining our family’s reputation.”<br/>Serena turned to him, her patience snapping. “Why don’t you just shut up for once?”<br/>Collins’s face darkened, and he shouted back, “How dare you talk to your brother like that!”<br/>Before either could say more, Mr. Moretti slammed his palm on the table.<br/>“Enough! The both of you!”<br/>His voice shook, not with anger, but exhaustion. He drew a deep breath and continued, his voice now very low.<br/>“Serena… this family is dying. We are on the edge of losing everything. Mr. Vasilios has started charging us for inter-state transportation, and Norman promised to use his influence to talk to him, but only in exchange for your marriage to him.”<br/>He paused, his eyes pleading.<br/>“Please, Serena. Help us. We are bleeding every day… losing more than you can imagine, we will become poor in no time.”<br/>The room fell heavy. Norman stayed silent, watching her closely.<br/>Serena’s chest tightened. Her father’s voice trembled with so much desperation that her anger melted into sorrow. <br/>She was lost of words, and didn't even know what to say.<br/>Charles stood still, his pulse racing. He thought.<br/>‘What if she gives in and changes her mind?’.<br/>If she broke the engagement now, His once completed mission could become invalid to Godfather.<br/>Then, before anyone could speak, he stepped forward.<br/>“I can talk to Mr. Vasilios”.</div>
