        <h1>chapter 125</h1>
        <div>They arrived back home and Charles loosened his tie, tired already.<br/>“Did the Godfather send another mission?” he asked.<br/>Lizzypie shook her head. “No. But expect it anytime soon. And this one will be difficult than before”<br/>Charles let out a long breath.<br/>Lizzypie added, “He also warned us that you’re exposing yourself a little too much lately. He doesn’t want that.”<br/>Charles frowned. “Why? For what? What was his reason I should stay out of public”<br/>“You should know,” she said. “He’s protecting you. Like I told you before… your existence is a big no to some people.”<br/>Charles clicked his tongue. “Then he should just tell me who the hell they are instead of doing all this to me, keeping me in the dark.”<br/>“Chill,” Lizzypie said. “He’s preparing you. I’m sure this is bigger than we think. When the time is right, he will tell us.”<br/>Charles sighed. “Or I and Natasha will find that out .”<br/>Lizzypie’s eyes narrowed. “Look, you have to stop that investigation. Focus on these damn missions. You are risking your life, and Natasha’s too. When time comes you will naturally know the truth”<br/>Charles was about to respond when his phone beeped.<br/>It was a message from Tracy.<br/>[Please meet me at the Quiloz Bar.]<br/>He frowned, wondering what it was this time?<br/>He was ready to ignore it when another message came in:<br/>[I’m not trying to be a pussy this time. Please come. I just want to have a simple talk.]<br/>Charles exhaled and faced Lizzypie. “I’ll be back.”<br/>Lizzypie just watched him go. She didn’t stop him.<br/>---<br/>At the bar, Charles arrived and scanned around. There was no sign of Tracy.<br/>He frowned and texted her.<br/>[Where are you?]<br/>A reply came quickly.<br/>[Room 22. Please come in here]<br/>Charles typed back: [ You come out]<br/>Tracy responded, [ It’s serious. I don’t want people hearing us]<br/>Charles groaned, annoyed, and headed toward the private rooms.<br/>He walked down the hallway, found Room 22 and knocked.<br/>Then the door opened and he hesitantly stepped inside.<br/>The room was spacious and well lit. He could see every corner clearly. There were bottles of wine on the table, a small cake in the middle, and beside it… a set of two rings.<br/>He frowned. His gaze shifted back to Tracy.<br/>She was wearing nightwear.<br/>A black lace piece that barely covered her bra and her lower part. Her nipples were visibly showing through the thin fabric. Her firm small cups of breast were still firm like it had never been touched.  <br/>She stood there, breathing lightly, her eyes fixed on Charles. <br/>Charles asked, “What’s all this, Tracy?”<br/>She smiled. “A party of reconciliation. Of us getting back together.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “What the hell are you saying?”<br/>Tracy said, “Look, I know you attacked my mother and sister today because you wanted my attention.”<br/>Charles rubbed his forehead. “Fuck, shit… stop being delusional. And stop accusing me. I didn’t attack your sister.”<br/>Tracy said, “It doesn’t matter if you won’t accept it, but I decided to make things easier for you. Charles… Please let’s get back together.”<br/>Charles looked around the room again. “So this is what all this is about?”<br/>Tracy nodded. “Yes. We will have a nice night together, put the rings on our hands, and tomorrow we will go to the court for marriage registration.”<br/>Charles said, “Tracy, stop being funny and delusional. I don’t want you in my life again. And I have a fiancée.”<br/>Tracy said, “Serena? I know you two aren’t really together. You barely even spend time with her. I can sense she’s using you. Just like that b— that lady with you. They are rich. And you… you are smart, strong, and can fight, so they are using you for that.”<br/>She stepped closer. “Come back to me and everything will be different.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “You want me to come back to your Buddha bullshit?”<br/>Tracy said, “I’m past that, Charles. I will give you whatever you want now. Any time you want sex, any position, any style, I will give you. I regret everything. I apologize for what I did in our marriage. Let’s set things right.”<br/>Charles sighed.<br/>Even though Tracy was still braggy and full of pride, at least she finally apologized and accepted she was the one who messed up.<br/>But he still said, “We are done. We will never have anything to do with each other again.”<br/>He turned to leave.<br/>Tracy snapped, “Why are you being so stubborn and thick-headed? Why are you making things so hard?”<br/>Charles said, “You are the one making things hard. I don’t have feelings for you anymore. Simple. Just accept that.”<br/>Tracy snapped, “That’s why you are still a poor, useless trash. That’s why your outfit every day doesn’t even cost a hundred. That’s why your life is where it is.”<br/>Charles shrugged. “You are already broke-shaming me. That’s exactly what will happen if we ever get married again.”<br/>Tracy shot back, “You made me say this because of your stubbornness. I’m giving you the best offer of your life. A way to turn your life around. I will make you the General Manager of my company! You won’t live like a useless man again!”<br/>Charles scoffed. “I’m not useless. And I’m past whatever you’re trying to offer.”<br/>Tracy laughed bitterly. “pass what?, you aren’t poor? You won some millions of months ago, so where is it? You don’t even have a car, no business started, no outfit to show off. Those ladies drained you. Can’t you use your brain for once? Not your dick. I will give you money, Charles!”<br/>Charles said, “Tracy, we are done. Fuck you and your money.”<br/>He turned to leave for the final.<br/>Tracy grabbed his wrist and pulled him back sharply, stepping close to him. She hugged him tightly.<br/>Slip!.<br/>Tracy suddenly loosened her nightwear bra, revealing her round pretty breast. She pressed it on Charles’s chest. </div>
