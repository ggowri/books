        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The COO stared at them for a long second, his brows drawn together.</p><p>&ldquo;Them?&rdquo; he asked flatly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tracy said immediately, stepping forward. &ldquo;They are extremely arrogant and they came here just to cause trouble. They were here because of the deal, but we&rsquo;ve already closed it. I honestly don&rsquo;t understand why they still had the nerve to come inside.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda crossed her arms and tilted her head, her smile cold. Then she turned to the COO beside her and softened instantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Jude, baby,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;I really hate it when someone looks down on my friends. Please just send them out real quick.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude hesitated.</p><p>Company protocol flickered in his mind. Visitors were supposed to be heard. Complaints were meant to be verified before any action. He cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; babe,&rdquo; he said carefully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s at least hear what they have to say.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda&rsquo;s expression hardened for half a second.</p><p>&ldquo;No, baby,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen at all. I don&rsquo;t want you listening to them. They disrespected my friend and I can&rsquo;t tolerate that.&rdquo;</p><p>She stepped closer and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Do this for me, babe.&rdquo;</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>The last trace of hesitation drained from Jude&rsquo;s eyes, just like it always did when Linda asked him for something. In fact, due to his foolishness, he had done many illegal things in the company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;He straightened, his chest puffing out with borrowed authority.</p><p>Then he walked toward Charles and Serena.</p><p>Serena instinctively moved closer and slipped behind Charles, her fingers gripping the back of his jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>Jude stopped in front of them and looked at Charles from up to down like he was some trash.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles lifted his chin slightly, his voice calm and steady.</p><p>&ldquo;We are here to seek a partnership,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your company is currently open to proposals, so we came to present ours.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied coldly, &ldquo;I have heard you are from the Moretti family. But we have already decided to sign through Mr. Collins. That decision is final. Leave Now.&rdquo;</p><p>Behind him, Collins and Tracy exchanged grins, their satisfaction visible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t even hear our presentation?&rdquo; Charles asked. &ldquo;Not even what we have to offer, despite company protocol?&rdquo;</p><p>Jude exhaled sharply, irritation flashing across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m not interested,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say. Save us all the trouble and leave right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Serena tugged at Charles&rsquo; sleeve, her voice low and urgent. But he shook her off without looking at her.</p><p>&ldquo;We are not leaving,&rdquo; Charles said evenly, &ldquo;until someone actually looks at what we came here to present.&rdquo;</p><p>That was enough.</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s face darkened completely.</p><p>&ldquo;You are really annoying,&rdquo; he said, his voice rising. &ldquo;I already hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>He jabbed a finger toward Charles. &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Man. I&rsquo;m the COO here. The CEO isn&rsquo;t around and I run this company. What I say is final. Leave now, before I call security. If I do, you will regret what happens next.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed, a faint smile tugging at his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny you mention regret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t fix this biased behavior, it won&rsquo;t be mine. It will be yours&rdquo;</p><p>The words hung in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>Serena swallowed hard, then finally stepped forward, her voice trembling but clear.</p><p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;give us a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins stepped forward quickly, seizing the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, this is exactly what I was saying,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;They are here to cause trouble. If you don&rsquo;t embarrass them now, they won&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda immediately grabbed Jude&rsquo;s arm, her nails digging in as she leaned into him. She shot Charles and Serena with a look filled with disdain.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you two really that dumb?&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one who listens to proposals and he already told you he won&rsquo;t take whatever nonsense you brought. Use your common sense and leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles let out a quiet scoff.</p><p>&ldquo;And who exactly are you to think you even have a say in this?&rdquo;</p><p>Linda&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief. &ldquo;Me? Who am I?&rdquo;</p><p>Before she could continue, Jude cut in sharply, pointing at Charles.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you,&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t concern you. Stop acting like a bee&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped himself, then exploded. &ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t you dare abuse my fianc&eacute;e. This is exactly what will make you regret everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Linda was already seething. She stepped forward, her face flushed with anger.</p><p>&ldquo;You just called me a bee?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Say that again. Say it once more and I swear I will slap you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t even blink.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;You are just buzzing into something that doesn&rsquo;t concern you. Like a bee.&rdquo;</p><p>That was it.</p><p>Linda screamed and raised her hand, swinging it toward Charles&rsquo; face.</p><p>But it never landed.</p><p>Serena moved faster than anyone expected.</p><p>She stepped in front of Charles and caught Linda&rsquo;s wrist midair, then shoved her back hard.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Serena snapped, her voice shaking with fury.</p><p>Linda stumbled back a step, heels scraping against the polished floor, shock flashing across her face as the lobby fell dead silent.</p><p>Linda let out a sharp, exaggerated cry and collapsed to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh&mdash;my leg!&rdquo; she screamed, clutching her calf. &ldquo;My leg! They broke my leg!&rdquo;</p><p>The lobby erupted.</p><p>Jude rushed to her side in a panic, dropping to his knees. &ldquo;Babe, baby, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked frantically. &ldquo;What happened to your leg?&rdquo;</p><p>Linda pointed at Serena, her face twisted in pain and fury. &ldquo;That crazy girl,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;She broke my leg.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude snapped</p><p>He stood up slowly, his face flushed red, his eyes wild. He pointed straight at Charles and Serena, his hand shaking with rage.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You both have trespassed now. I swear, I will make sure your legs are broken too.&rdquo;</p><p>He spun around and roared, his voice echoing through the vast lobby.</p><p>&ldquo;Security!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Security!&rdquo; he shouted!.</p><p>Two men hurried in from the side corridor, stopping in front of him.</p><p>Jude jabbed a finger toward Charles and Serena. &ldquo;What are you standing there for?&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Go and call all the others. I want everyone. Thirty of you if possible. Bring your weapons.&rdquo;</p><p>The guards stiffened.</p><p>&ldquo;These two,&rdquo; Jude continued furiously, &ldquo;just broke my fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s leg. I want you to do the same to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; one of the guards replied quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back now.&rdquo;</p><p>They turned and rushed off.</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s face was drained of color. Her breathing turned shallow as panic clawed up her chest.&nbsp;</p><p>She leaned closer to Charles and whispered, her voice trembling, &ldquo;Oh no&hellip; we should have left.&rdquo;</p><p>Collins chuckled darkly at her.</p><p>&ldquo;You are a really hot one, sister,&rdquo; he sneered mockingly. &ldquo;I knew this bastard would land you in serious trouble one day.&rdquo;</p></div>
