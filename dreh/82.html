        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div><p>Truly, Kyle had stopped breathing. He just lay there, still and lifeless. At this moment, Charles started breaking into sweat.</p><p>Lizzypie had told him that it might not work since they hadn’t tested it. He started thinking—what if they failed to refine the pill well? What if it wasn’t working?</p><p>Norman forced down his laughter. Since it was a sad thing, he tried to hide it, but he didn’t let the chance slide.</p><p> “I told you all! This man doesn’t know the shit he’s doing! He doesn’t know a damn thing! Now look—he’s killed your son!”</p><p>The doctor also added, “Look at him! What makes you even think you can cure him, huh? You just feel like you can? You are the most idiotic person I’ve ever seen!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios was furious. He didn’t even get to send his son away properly because Charles didn’t let him. He was burning with anger.</p><p>“You should have just kept your mouth shut! And just like you bet, you’ll lose your fingers! Guards!” he screamed out.</p><p>The guards rushed at Charles, attempting to pin him down. Janet stepped forward and said, “Death is inevitable! It’s not Charles’s fault—it would have happened anyway!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios, still consumed with rage, barked, “Then he should have learned to keep his mouth shut!”</p><p>Norman added, “Why do you even care about him? He just disrespected your brother to death! Cut off his fingers!”</p><p>Charles didn’t fight it—after all, it was a bet. One of the guards brought out a knife, its blade gleaming under the hospital light.</p><p>Just then….</p><p>Cough. Cough.</p><p>A sound. A weak, rough sound from behind.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios said, voice trembling, “Who… who is that from?”</p><p>Everyone looked around, confusion twisting their faces.</p><p>Then again—</p><p> Cough… cough.</p><p>They turned sharply toward Kyle.</p><p>He was the one coughing.</p><p>Janet gasped. “Brother…!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios staggered forward, tears already flooding his eyes. “My son… my son!”</p><p>The doctor dropped his tools, stunned. He was so sure he wasn&#x27;t breathing some moments ago. </p><p> Norman ’s mouth fell open, unable to speak.</p><p>And then—</p><p> With a sharp gasp, Kyle’s eyes snapped open to life.</p><p>Janet screamed, half laughing, half crying. “He’s alive! He’s still alive!”</p><p>The monitor started beeping again, steady, strong, alive.</p><p> Mr. Vasilios fell to his knees, hands trembling as he reached for his son.</p><p> Charles exhaled slowly, his sweat-soaked face finally calm.</p><p>The doctor quickly checked his heartbeat, breathing, pulse and  everything. His heart was stable.</p><p>Norman muttered, “Good thing he’s still alive, and this bastard didn’t kill him yet.”</p><p>Charles said calmly, “He isn’t just alive. He’s cured.”</p><p>Norman snapped, “Drop the bullshit before you get yourself into another problem!”</p><p>Then suddenly, by himself, Kyle raised his hand, something he hadn’t been able to do in years.</p><p>“What!” Janet gasped. “He just lifted his hand!”</p><p>Kyle took the hand to his face, reaching toward the tubes. The doctor panicked. “That’s dangerous! You can’t breathe on your own! Stop!”</p><p>Charles said firmly, “Remove it.”</p><p>The doctor shouted, “That’s stupid! Are you crazy? Remove the life support and he will die instantly!”</p><p>Norman added, “You better not ride on your luck! Remove life support  for what!”</p><p>Then, a sharp, audible voice came from Kyle himself — hoarse but strong:</p><p>“Remove this fucking thing away!”</p><p>Everyone froze. The voice was loud, clear, defiant and so much alive.</p><p>Charles immediately removed the tube.</p><p>“Oh no!” they all shouted — but then stopped.</p><p>Kyle was breathing.</p><p>Steady and effortless.</p><p>Like nothing had ever been wrong. Like he’d been waiting all this time just to wake up.</p><p>“Father…” Kyle said softly.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios rushed to him, eyes wide and wet. “You can see me?”</p><p>Kyle smiled faintly. “Father, why do I feel so strong? I feel like I could jump anywhere. I’m so strong… clear-headed… after all these years.”</p><p>Without any help, he sat up on his own — something no one thought he could ever do again. </p><p>Janet covered her mouth in disbelief. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Kyle laughed. “Okay? Sister, I’m more than okay! Every bone in me is intact. I feel like running!”</p><p>Everyone stood in stunned silence.</p><p>Norman stepped back, pale.</p><p>The doctor stared at the monitor, unable to speak.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios sank to his knees again, clutching his son’s arm like he couldn’t believe it.</p><p>It was clear now that Charles’ treatment had worked. </p><p>Mr. Vasilios went down on his knees, trembling. “Oh, I’m so grateful… You spoke and you did it. Fuck!!! after all these years…”</p><p>Norman scoffed. “Look, Mr. Kyle must have healed by himself!”</p><p>Janet snapped. “Shut up! He was literally dying just moments ago!”</p><p>Kyle looked around, still in awe of his own body. “I felt something enter my mouth,” he said. “And that thing… it started waking my organs up—everything inside me.”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios’s eyes widened, realization dawning. “It worked then… your pill. It really worked.”</p><p>Kyle stretched his arms, rolled his shoulders, and twisted his neck to show everyone he was fine. </p><p>Charles stepped forward, calm as ever. “Well,” he said quietly, “we have some bets to settle.”</p><p>Norman’s grin faded instantly. His hands began to tremble. “W-What are you talking about?”</p><p>Charles turned his gaze toward him — cold, steady, unblinking. “You remember. You said if I couldn’t treat him, I’d lose my fingers. But if I did…” He stepped closer, his tone deepening. “You lose yours.”</p><p>Norman swallowed hard, taking a step back. </p><p>Charles ignored him, then turned toward the doctor. His voice cut through the silence like a blade.</p><p>“Your license.”</p><p>The doctor froze, his throat tight, unable to speak. Everyone stared, waiting for what would happen next.</p><p></p></div>
