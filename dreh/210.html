        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On their way home, the car was quiet for a while. Empty and calm after everything that had happened.</p><p>Lizzy was the one who finally broke the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;You really did the impossible,&rdquo; she said, eyes still on the road. &ldquo;Tell me honestly. How were you able to go into the Hole Realm and come back alive with the Kyoul Stone?&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha leaned forward from the back seat immediately. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m curious too.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles exhaled and began telling them everything. He narrated the entire journey, from the two border monsters, to the desert filled with creatures, to the cave, the serpent, and the realm spirit that guided him.&nbsp;</p><p>He explained how Aries helped him after he spared the guards and how the realm itself wasn&rsquo;t chaos, but a place where monsters lived peacefully and only reacted to invasion.</p><p>It took a long time to tell. The story almost covered the entire journey.</p><p>Lizzy shook her head in disbelief. &ldquo;So an unknown spirit helped you just because you didn&rsquo;t kill the guardians.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. The Hole Realm isn&rsquo;t what we thought. It&rsquo;s just monsters living their lives. They hate violations, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha sat back slowly. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m witnessing all this. Even my grandchildren wouldn&rsquo;t believe this story.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy smirked and glanced sideways at Charles. &ldquo;Aries,&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;I bet she&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles shrugged. &ldquo;Probably. She sounded feminine. I never saw her though.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy groaned dramatically. &ldquo;You even charmed a spirit. Badasss.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like that. I didn&rsquo;t even see her.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha laughed. &ldquo;He always has a way of impressing women. Smooth with it. I bet Aries wanted to follow you back.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles waved it off with a small scoff and stayed quiet about what Aries had actually said that she would come to the human world.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the trip home passed in conversation.</p><p>They reached the hotel late in the evening.</p><p>The moment they entered the room, Charles dropped onto the couch with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Fuck&hellip; I&rsquo;m exhausted.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy stood there for a second, hands clasped together. She gulped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; for dragging you into all this trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles waved a tired hand. &ldquo;You should be. You almost turned into a political sex slave if I didn&rsquo;t show up in time.&rdquo; He looked at her, voice softer now. &ldquo;Like I said, you are like my first wife. You are supposed to tell me when something&rsquo;s wrong but you hid everything!!&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy looked down, guilt written all over her face. &ldquo;I should have,&rdquo; she admitted quietly.</p><p>From the side, Natasha made a small sound with jealousy.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;And what does that make me&hellip; second?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles froze for half a second.</p><p>He gulped. There was a whole ranking system in his head he absolutely wasn&rsquo;t going to say out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he just smiled awkwardly and leaned back into the couch.</p><p>Lizzy looked at him for a long moment with a sly smile. She stepped closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; you said you were tired,&rdquo; she murmured, letting the words curl like smoke. &ldquo;Well&hellip; let me ease it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Charles could even process the shift, Lizzy was already gracefully on her knees in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Her hands moved slowly to his trosuer and unzipped iy.</p><p>She slid her warm palm down inside his boxers, wrapping around his cock gently. Charles sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he managed to say,&nbsp; &ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s right here.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha hadn&rsquo;t moved. She stood a few feet away, arms still loosely crossed, eyes fixed on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Lizzy didn&rsquo;t pull her hand away. Instead she gave him one slow, teasing stroke, thumb circling the tip just enough to make his hips jerk involuntarily.</p><p>&ldquo;Ohh,&rdquo; Lizzy said, glancing sideways at Natasha with a small, wicked smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I got carried away.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha&rsquo;s voice came out softer than usual, almost shy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I should go&rdquo;</p><p>She took one hesitant step toward the door, then stopped dead in her tracks. Her back was to them, shoulders tense.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip; if I join in?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s eyes snapped wide. His brain flatlined for a solid three seconds.</p><p>Lizzy&rsquo;s smile bloomed full and delighted. She looked up at him, still slowly working her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be perfectly fine,&rdquo; she purred. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, Charles?&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his mouth. Nothing came out.&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha half-turned, biting her lower lip. &ldquo;Or&hellip; I should le&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no! Don't leave&rdquo; Charles blurted, &ldquo;you can join.&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy's eyes sparkled with mischief as she heard Charles's desperate plea.&nbsp;</p><p>She gave his cock another slow stroke, feeling it throb and harden fully in her grip.&nbsp;</p><p>"Come" she whispered, her voice slutty and teasing. Charles was amazed to see this side of her.&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha stepped closer,&nbsp; she knelt beside Lizzy.&nbsp;</p><p>The two women exchanged a glance</p><p>&nbsp;Lizzy began first as she leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to the head of his cock, her tongue flicking out to taste the bead of his precum there. Charles groaned, his hands clenching the couch cushions.</p><p>Natasha joined in&nbsp; as she reached out, wrapping around the base of his cock while Lizzy held the tip.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, they stroked him in unison&mdash;up and down, slow and gentle.</p><p>&nbsp;Charles's head fell back, a low moan escaping his lips. "Fuck... that feels amazing."</p><p>Lizzy smiled and guided Natasha's hand higher, showing her how to twist gently at the top. Natasha leaned in closer, her lips brushing the side of his shaft.&nbsp;</p><p>She planted soft kisses along the length, her tongue darting out to lick the sensitive skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Lizzy mirrored her on the other side, their mouths meeting at the tip in a sloppy, shared kiss around his cockhead.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles watched, mesmerized, his cock pulsing between their warm, wet lips.</p><p>Lizzy pulled back slightly, tugging Natasha's shirt up and over her head, exposing her full breasts in a lacy bra. &nbsp; She unhooked Natasha's bra, letting her tits spill free&mdash;round and heavy, nipples already hard.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles couldn't resist; he reached out, grabbing Natasha's boobs with both hands, squeezing the soft flesh, thumbs rubbing circles over her nipples.</p><p>&nbsp;She gasped, arching into his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; how much I love this!&rdquo;.</p></div>
