        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div><p>Charles followed the maid&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>He saw&nbsp; the window on the upper floor, flames pouring out violently, black smoke rolling nonstop. The fire there was serious. Way worse than the rest.</p><p>Hearing her words, several guards rushed toward the entrance at once.</p><p>People panicked and started shouting.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone was being evacuated successfully. Everyone except her.</p><p>Wailing broke out.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not even on her wheelchair!&rdquo; someone cried. &ldquo;Poor Miss Gabriella!&rdquo;</p><p>A man turned sharply toward the maid. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you supposed to be with her? Why wasn&rsquo;t she on her wheelchair?&rdquo;</p><p>The maid broke down completely. &ldquo;She went to the toilet,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;She sent me to get something for her. I didn&rsquo;t know this would happen.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo; eyes narrowed. Wheelchair. So she couldn&rsquo;t walk.</p><p>That explained everything. Why she had no public appearances.</p><p>The guards who had rushed in suddenly stumbled back out, coughing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t enter!&rdquo; one of them shouted. &ldquo;The fire is everywhere. It&rsquo;s too intense!&rdquo;</p><p>Flames surged higher through the windows.</p><p>A well-dressed man, clearly part of the family, yelled in panic. &ldquo;Then go in again! Save my niece!&rdquo;</p><p>The guards shook their heads. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just rush in. We have to wait for the firefighters. Call an emergency now!&rdquo;</p><p>Another family member snapped back, &ldquo;She will be dead before they arrive! Do something!&rdquo;</p><p>The guards hesitated, clearly lost.</p><p>Charles looked up again. The flames were climbing fast.</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>He remembered his past as firefighters. The way fires spread and they could never enter.</p><p>She wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p><p>Without another word, Charles stepped forward.</p><p>A hand suddenly grabbed his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo; one of the guards barked. &ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles yanked his hand free. &ldquo;To save her. Obviously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will die from smoke before the fire reaches her if we don&rsquo;t act now.&rdquo;</p><p>The well-dressed man stepped closer, eyes sharp. &ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t answered the question. Who are you, and what do you think you are doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saving her, we don't have time for this talk&rdquo; Charles replied flatly.</p><p>One of the guards snapped, &ldquo;How? The fire is everywhere. We already told you that. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do.&rdquo;</p><p>Another added quickly, &ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t even know you. Who&rsquo;s to say you are not the one responsible for this fire?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly. Talking to them was pointless and would only waste time.&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes hardened.</p><p>[Eyes of Satan activated]</p><p>[Flash Mode activated]</p><p>In the next instant, he vanished.</p><p>The guards froze.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck&mdash;?&rdquo; one of them shouted. &ldquo;Where did he go?!&rdquo;</p><p>Before anyone could react, Charles was already upstairs.</p><p>Fire raged everywhere. Flames crawled across the walls and ceiling, smoke thick enough to choke. Heat pressed in from all sides. The guards were not exaggerating at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Then he heard it.</p><p>A weak, panicked voice cutting through the roar of the fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Save me&hellip; I&rsquo;m here&hellip; please&hellip; somebody save me.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles turned onto the sound. It was a female voice. That had to be Gabriella.</p><p>Charles looked toward the room entrance. Fire swallowed the doorway completely. Flames rolled and snapped like a living thing.</p><p>[Flash Mode activated]</p><p>He rushed straight through the fire. The heat brushed past him.</p><p>Inside, it was worse. The room was burning like hell.</p><p>&ldquo;Save me&hellip; I&rsquo;m here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The voice was clearer now. The sound came from the toilet.</p><p>The fire hadn&rsquo;t reached it yet. That was the only reason she was still alive.</p><p>Charles slammed the door open.</p><p>Thud!!!.</p><p>Then, he saw her. A round, beautiful face, pale with fear. Smoke clung to her hair. Her eyes widened the moment she saw him.</p><p>She screamed. &ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; Charles said quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save you.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head in panic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you. Are you here to kidnap me? Please don&rsquo;t. My father will give you whatever you want. Please spare me.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. &ldquo;No time for that.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t wait for permission.</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her and lifted her up, carrying her in his arms in the Princess style.&nbsp;</p><p>Then he turned but stopped in his tracks because there was no exit.</p><p>Fire blocked every path.</p><p>And with her in his arms, his flashstep wouldn&rsquo;t be fast enough anymore.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside, the panic hadn&rsquo;t stopped.</p><p>People shouted. Guards ran back and forth. No one knew what was happening inside.</p><p>Then a black car screeched to a stop at the gate.</p><p>Mr. Belly jumped out.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is my daughter?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Where the fuck is my daughter?!&rdquo;</p><p>The head of the guards rushed to him. &ldquo;Sir, we tried to get in, but the fire is everywhere. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Smack!!!.</p><p>Mr. Belly slapped him hard across the face.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you saying?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You left my daughter there?&rdquo;</p><p>He pointed at the building. &ldquo;Go in now! If anything happens to my daughter, I will kill all of you!&rdquo;</p><p>The guards exchanged looks.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you still standing there?&rdquo; Mr. Belly screamed. &ldquo;Enter right now!&rdquo;</p><p>They hesitated, fear written all over their faces. Some took reluctant steps forward, then stopped again.</p><p>Just then, one of the maids narrowed her eyes, staring at the entrance.</p><p>Her voice trembled. &ldquo;Wait&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone turned.</p><p>&ldquo;I think&hellip; someone is coming out.&rdquo;</p></div>
