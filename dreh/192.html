        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div><p>Collins laughed sharply. “Me? Abetting a killing?” His voice rose. “You would better watch what you are saying.”</p><p>Allison stood up at once. “Serena, don’t you think you have gone too far?” she snapped. “Accusing him of murder?”</p><p>Mr. Gerald added coldly, “You deserve to be sent away from this family for saying something like that.”</p><p>Serena didn’t answer. She didn’t even look at them. Her eyes stayed on Charles.</p><p>Charles said nothing either.</p><p>He turned and walked out.</p><p>The room erupted at once.</p><p>“What is this nonsense?”.</p><p>A minute later, the doors opened again.</p><p>Charles walked back in, dragging a man behind him. The man was badly injured. His clothes were torn. His face was swollen and bruised. Blood stains all over  his shirt.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Charles dropped him on the floor.</p><p>Everyone jolted back.</p><p>Allison shrieked. “What the hell do you think you are doing?” She pointed at the man. “Who is this?”</p><p>Angry voices exploded around the room. People cursed Charles openly.</p><p>“Are you mad? What type of uncultured behavior is this?”. </p><p>“Who the hell is this?. Why would you drag someone to our Grandroom!”.</p><p>Collins turned to Mr. Moretti, furious. “Father, send him away right now. This is outrageous. Completely disrespectful.”</p><p>Serena finally spoke. “Why are you so anxious?” she asked calmly. “Don’t you want to know why he brought this man here?”</p><p>Collins snapped back, “Father, don’t let them spew nonsense.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti frowned. He looked from Collins to Serena. “Go on,” he said slowly. “What is this about?”</p><p>Serena lifted her chin. “This is one of the men we caught,” she said. “The one hired to hijack us and take the signed document. They tried to kill us and confessed that Collins sent them.”</p><p>The room broke into chaos.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p>“Collins would never do that.”</p><p>“That’s too far-fetched if it&#x27;s true”</p><p>Collins shouted, “No! They are lying. I didn&#x27;t hire anyone!!!”</p><p>Serena stepped closer to the man on the floor. “Tell them,” she said evenly. “Who sent you to hijack us?”</p><p>The man trembled. His eyes darted around the room. Then he slowly raised his hand and pointed at Collins.</p><p>“Him!”.</p><p>Collins raised his hands quickly. “Father, this is exactly what I’m talking about,” he said, forcing calm into his voice.</p><p> “They are accusing me and spewing nonsense. That’s why I said you shouldn’t allow this. Serena has gone too far. I didn’t even know this man”</p><p>Mr. Moretti sighed heavily. The room had gone quiet again. “Do you have proof?” he asked Serena. </p><p>“Yes,” Serena replied without hesitation.</p><p>The man on the floor shifted and weakly pulled out his phone. His hands were shaking. “Everything is here,” he said. “The calls. The messages and the money he sent us.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti took the phone at once.</p><p>He stood there, scrolling. His face hardened with every second. Bank transfers. Names. Dates. Messages spelling everything out clearly. </p><p>He passed the phone to Mr. Gerald, then to others at the table.</p><p>Gasps spread through the room.</p><p>“This is real…”</p><p>“The transfers are there.”</p><p>“These messages—”</p><p>Collins shook his head violently. “Lies,” he snapped. “They fabricated everything. It’s fake.”</p><p>Charles moved. He walked up to Collins without a word and grabbed his wrist.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Collins shouted.</p><p>Charles twisted it. </p><p>Crack!!!</p><p>A sharp sound cut through the room.</p><p>“Aaaah!” Collins screamed, dropping to one knee.</p><p>Charles took Collins’ phone as it fell from his hand. He pressed it against Collins’ face and unlocked it, then turned the screen toward the table.</p><p>“Check,” he said flatly.</p><p>The messages were also there from its side. The same instructions. The same transfers. From Collins’ own device.</p><p>Silence crashed down hard. Now it was undeniable.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s voice shook with fury. “You tried to kill your sister?”</p><p>The room erupted in whispers.</p><p>“I can’t believe this.”</p><p>“He went that far?”</p><p>“This is madness.”</p><p>Collins yelled, his face twisted with rage and pain. “No! I didn’t try to kill her.” He laughed harshly. “I only wanted the file. It was supposed to be mine in the first place.”</p><p>He looked around wildly. “I just wanted it hijacked. That’s all.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s voice dropped, heavy and sharp. “So you really hired people to hijack your own sister.”</p><p>“Yes,” Collins said, lifting his chin. “So what? She started all this first.”</p><p>“I have never been wrong about you,” Mr. Moretti said slowly. “You are dangerous. You can’t run this family. And now I see it clearly. Tracy was the one behind whatever achievements you claimed.”</p><p>Serena stepped forward. Her voice was steady, almost cold. “I wanted to report this to the police,” she said. “And you know what that means. Ten years in prison for abetting a murder.”</p><p>Collins’ face was drained of color. His hands shook.</p><p>“But what are we family for?” Serena continued. “So this is what I want. Collins should be ejected from this family. Disowned and sent away with nothing.”</p><p>Collins sprang to his feet. “What the hell are you saying? Sent away with nothing?”</p><p>Allison stood up quickly. “He made a horrible mistake,” she said. “But this is too cruel.”</p><p>Serena turned to her. “A horrible mistake?” Her eyes burned. “I almost died!!.”</p><p>She faced the room. “That’s what I want. And it’s final.”</p><p>Collins laughed bitterly. “This is rubbish. I’m not accepting this.”</p><p>Serena turned to her father. “That is my condition,” she said calmly. “If you refuse, I will involve the police”</p><p>Mr. Moretti closed his eyes and let out a long breath.</p><p>Then he looked at Collins.</p><p>“You committed a terrible act,” he said. “The choice is yours.”</p><p>Collins’ voice broke. “Father… please. Don’t do this.”</p><p>“You should have thought of that before you nearly killed your sister,” Mr. Moretti replied.</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>“Now choose,” he said. “Will you leave this family… or will you go to prison?”</p><p></p></div>
