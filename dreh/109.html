        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div><p>Derek yanked out his phone with shaking hands.</p><p>He searched frantically for Charles’s sex tape, scrolling, tapping, swiping. When he finally found the video file, he pressed it immediately.</p><p>Only for his own scandalous video to play again.</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>Lizzypie had hacked into his phone.</p><p>She’d switched every copy.</p><p>There was no Charles tape again on his phone. </p><p>He felt the floor tilt under his feet.</p><p>People whispered louder now, his name echoing across the hall</p><p>“Disgusting.”</p><p>“He really did that?”</p><p>He couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Unable to take another second, Derek bolted for the exit, practically shoving people aside as he rushed out of the hall.</p><p>People hissed behind him:</p><p>“Look at him running.”</p><p>“What a coward.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Hailey slipped away through the opposite door.</p><p>Her face was pale, her hands trembling.</p><p>People yelled after her:</p><p>“Shame on you!”</p><p>“You betrayed your own daughter!”</p><p>“She’s a mother? How could she?”</p><p>She didn’t look back. She just ran.</p><p>---</p><p>And Tracy… the one at the center of the humiliation… sat frozen for several seconds before standing.</p><p>Her legs felt numb and her vision still blurred with tears.</p><p>She walked slowly, silently, away from the hall and back toward the washroom.</p><p>Inside the empty tiled room, she staggered to the sink, gripped the cold metal, and let the tears fall freely.</p><p>She splashed water on her face, again and again, her chest tight, her head hot with pain.</p><p>“Why… why…” she whispered through sobs. Her knees threatened to give out.</p><p>Just then, the washroom door opened.</p><p>A soft, concerned voice asked, “Are you okay?”</p><p>Tracy lifted her head slowly, eyes red, cheeks wet.</p><p>Standing at the doorway was Ms. Youvenne, one of the key anchors of the night and a respected staff member of the IAA.</p><p>Her face held pure concern with  genuine empathy.</p><p>“Tracy…” Ms. Youvenne stepped closer.</p><p>“Do you need help?”</p><p>Tracy wiped her eyes, but the tears kept coming. “How… how can I be fine?” she whispered shakily. </p><p>“After what I just witnessed? How can anyone be fine?” Her voice cracked. “Or maybe… maybe the video was doctored? Maybe it was AI? You know how dangerous that thing is now… maybe it wasn’t real…”</p><p>Ms. Youvenne sighed softly. “I wish that were the case, Tracy. Truly, I do.” She placed a gentle hand on Tracy’s shoulder.</p><p> “But Derek and your mother didn’t deny it. We all saw their faces. And…” she exhaled deeply, “I went to confront the studio man myself. To find out who instructed him to air that video. Because regardless of the content, it’s a crime ,  a big crime  to broadcast that kind of footage during an official ceremony, but the one who uploaded it was none other than Derek himself.”</p><p>Tracy broke. Completely. Of course Derek uploaded it. Because he planned to upload Charles’s tape. Charles simply outsmarted him… turned the trap around.</p><p>Tracy didn’t say it out loud.</p><p>She just sobbed harder, shoulders shaking violently.</p><p>“Tracy…” Ms. Youvenne whispered, voice soft but heavy. “I’m really sorry. But because of everything that happened tonight… we will have to remove you as the Most Prestigious Performing Business Personnel of the Year.”</p><p>Tracy’s whole body went still.</p><p>Then she looked up slowly, her expression blank, disbelieving.</p><p>“What… what’s that?” she whispered, voice barely audible.</p><p>That award is given to the highest-performing businessperson of the entire year. It’s above Serena’s award. In fact, it’s so rare that it’s only given once every five years. Only to someone who exceeds expectations in innovation, leadership, and impact.</p><p>Tracy stared at her, confused, lost.</p><p>“You mean… Prestigious Performing Business Personnel of the Year… you… you wanted to give it to me?”</p><p>Youvenne nodded sadly. “Yes. You worked incredibly hard. You were on our shortlist from the beginning. You collaborated with our team, excelled in every evaluation. So we decided to surprise you with it tonight. To honor you publicly.”</p><p>She reached into her bag and gently pulled out a golden plaque. Tracy’s name was engraved beautifully across it.</p><p>[Tracy Hailey — Prestigious Performing Business Personnel of the Year]</p><p>Youvenne held it out for Tracy to see, her expression full of sympathy.</p><p>“We wanted to give you this before…” she said quietly.</p><p>“Before that scandalous video came out. </p><p>We can’t award it anymore.</p><p>The words shattered Tracy more brutally than the video had.Her breath hitched painfully, and her heart sank like a stone.</p><p>Just minutes ago, she had been seconds away from receiving the highest honor of her career.</p><p>Realization hit her like a violent punch to the chest.</p><p>Just moments ago,  before the video aired, Derek and her mother had left the decision in her head.  To release the tape or not. She was told they wouldn&#x27;t upload it if she refused.</p><p>And she gave them the go-ahead.</p><p>Because she wanted Serena destroyed and  Charles ruined.</p><p>Because of her  jealousy, anger, and wounded pride had clouded her judgment.</p><p>That upload, the very one she  approved,  cost her the most Prestigious Business Personnel award.</p><p>She had destroyed her own life with her own hands.</p><p>Karma hit her hard.</p><p>Tracy collapsed against the sink, shaking violently.</p><p>“No… fuck… no… I shouldn’t have allowed them… I shouldn’t have let them convince me…”</p><p>Ms. Youvenne winced in confusion.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Tracy… I truly am. I should leave now.”</p><p>She began to walk away.</p><p>But Tracy rushed after her.</p><p>“Wait! Please… you can still give me the award. And announce it later. People will understand… I am the victim here…”</p><p>Ms. Youvenne turned slowly, her expression sad but firm.</p><p>“It doesn’t work like that, Tracy. Everyone in that hall is elite, high class, high stakes. Their standards are strict. They won’t want anything attached to the scandal.”</p><p>Tracy blinked through tears. </p><p>“Maybe next year,” Youvenne whispered. “But for this year… it’s gone. I’m sorry. There’s nothing I can do.”</p><p>She left quietly.</p><p>Tracy stood alone in the washroom, her knees buckled as she slid down the wall, covering her face with both trembling hands.</p><p>“Oh fuck me…” she cried out, voice breaking.</p><p>“I used my own hands… to destroy my own life…”</p><p></p></div>
