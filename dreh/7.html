        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div>Charles stood there for so many hours, he couldn’t even remember, staring at the blank screen of the laptop. Hours had passed since the video stopped, but it was still playing in his head, over and over again.<br/>He understood now. Tracy didn’t love him, not even during their marriage. And right now, he finally grasped everything.<br/>He was poor, but smart. She was the CEO of Zenith Consortium. Back then, it wasn’t this big, but all its success came from his idea. When Charles first met her, he had been thinking about the company and came up with a brilliant idea that fetched her millions. Since then, they had bonded really fast, and she wouldn’t let him go. Now, thinking about it, it was all because of Charles’ idea. He believed that was the reason she had been keeping him around.<br/>Tracy had become one of the biggest businesswomen in the city, while he was still poor. Derek, on the other hand, also came from a wealthy background. So she was announcing her relationship with Derek while keeping Charles by her side.<br/>Even now, even when she was doing him wrong, she didn’t want to let him go. She saw him as a commodity.<br/>Charles stared at his phone as the screen went dark, leaving him more disheartened than ever. Just then, it lit up again with a message from John again. <br/>“The fire has flared up again, and is becoming bigger.   I will pick you up in 20 minutes.”<br/>He put down his phone and started packing immediately. So he could be ready before John arrived.<br/>This marriage was over...beyond repair. And Francis turned out to be her son. That changed everything. With this, he no longer wanted anything to do with Tracy.<br/>All the memories, all their so-called romantic moments didn’t matter. He was finally over with it.<br/>He kept packing. After doing it all, he decided to leave a message, since she wouldn’t pick up his calls, and meeting her physically was pointless, Derek would just follow her again.<br/>He grabbed a pen, his heart heavy with pain, every memory of her love still burning inside him. Tears streamed down his face as he began to write.<br/>[You know I’m crying as I write this letter. Not out of weakness, but because now I see how pathetic I have been. In the last five years of our marriage, I was the one struggling to keep it together, always trying to make you happy, helping your company reach where it is today. I loved you, cherished you, and even nearly died because of you… yet you shared my story as if it belonged to someone else.]<br/>[Fuck me for believing your Buddhist teachings. Buddhism is about love and morals, but you have none. If you knew you had your first love, why did you marry me and make me fall for you? I truly fell for you, and even now, I wanted to believe in you...but not anymore.]<br/>[And now it turns out Francis is your child. You deceived me all this while and lied. Well, this is where it ends, whether you accept the divorce  or not, I don't care. Don’t find me, don’t call me. Assume I have died on my mission. Never look for me again. Goodbye, Tracy. I loved you more than you ever did.]<br/>After finishing writing the letter and packing everything, Charles left it on the table where Tracy could easily see it.<br/>At that moment, John was already outside the hotel. Charles already sent him the location.<br/>Charles walked out with his big suitcase. John crossed his arms and frowned.<br/>“Mmm, why are you packing everything? We aren’t going to stay that long. The fire may have been subdued a little. Not as dangerous as before,” he said, noticing the suitcase.<br/>Charles forced a smile. “Just want to bring some things along.”<br/>John nodded, and the two of them made their way to the site.<br/>When they arrived, the destruction was staggering. Four apartment buildings had been reduced to rubble. The fire was mostly down now, but rescue teams were still carrying people out, soot and blood streaked across their uniforms. Ashes floated through the air, mingling with smoke, and the cries of survivors echoed everywhere.<br/>For days, they tried to finish up the rescue and everything. Charles wasn't in the front, but his stomach twisted as he watched people wailing, some clutching the burned bodies of loved ones. Burned residents were being carried from the ruins everyday by day, and he recognized some of his colleagues among them.  Firefighters who had left their own happily married lives to save others.<br/>He swallowed hard, wishing he could exchange his poor life and crumbling marriage for the stability and love these people had lost. He felt the sting of his own losses more sharply than ever.<br/>After some days when everything was about to be finished up, Charles and others were among the front Call.<br/>Meanwhile, beside one of the buildings, a gas leak hissed quietly. The people around had no idea.<br/>******<br/>At Zenith Consortium, Tracy stepped out from an important meeting, her posture graceful but her eyes betraying a hint of fatigue. She rubbed her temples lightly.<br/>Just then,  she stopped. feeling a strange heaviness in the air.<br/>Her manager noticed immediately. “Ma’am, is anything wrong? Are you tired? Should i cancel our schedule for today so you could rest”.<br/>Tracy straightened and shook her head. “No. Nothing.” But then, almost instinctively, she asked, “Where’s Charles?”<br/>The manager smiled politely. “I left him at the hotel, ma’am. He should certainly be there.”<br/>Tracy nodded absently and pulled out her phone. It had been days since Charles had called her. She scoffed under her breath. “What now? Are you finally coming back to your senses? I thought your poor self couldn’t live without me”.<br/>She swept into her office, and settled down.<br/>“Check up on my husband,” she ordered suddenly. “See what he is up to.”<br/>Her manager immediately went out to check. <br/>Finally, after some minutes, the manager returned, her face pale. “Ma’am… Mr. Charles never stayed at the hotel.”<br/>Tracy froze.</div>
