        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div><p>Lizzy scoffed and shook her head. “I just told you, it’s a no-go area for men.”</p><p>“And why is that?” Charles asked immediately.</p><p>Lizzy hesitated, then explained, “Because the realm is swarming with monsters. High-level monsters. Creatures so strong you can’t even defeat one of them with your current power.”</p><p>She paused, then added, “And they attack men. Only men. They don’t attack women at all. For women, the only challenge is retrieving the stone and surviving the process of letting it merge with their body.”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly, absorbing every word, then asked, “So what happens if a man obtains the stone instead of a woman? You said if a woman touches it, it dissolves into her body.”</p><p>Lizzy frowned. “What are you getting at?”</p><p>“Just answer me,” Charles said calmly.</p><p>She hesitated, then replied, “Nothing happens. It stays solid. If a man wants to use it, he has to absorb its energy directly.”</p><p>Charles’s lips curved into a slow smile. “That’s it,” he said. “I’ll enter the Hole Realm and get the stone.”</p><p>Lizzy froze.</p><p>“With that,” Charles continued, voice firm, “you won’t have to marry that brat.”</p><p>She stared at him, stunned, unable to speak.</p><p>Before she could, Natasha cut in sharply. “Did you even listen to what she said? She just told you it’s full of monsters. High-level monsters you can’t even beat one of.”</p><p>Lizzy found her voice again, panic seeping in. “No man has ever returned from the Hole Realm. Are you insane? Just stop whatever you’re thinking.”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “How many men have gone and not returned?” he asked. “Maybe they were doing something wrong.”</p><p>He looked straight at Lizzy, eyes steady. “I’m telling you, nothing will happen.”</p><p>Natasha frowned and said, “What about the Divine Oath?”</p><p>Charles answered without hesitation. “Oaths like that only bind both sides as long as both sides agree to keep it. If they cut it off willingly, nothing happens. Right?”</p><p>He turned to Lizzy.</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “Yes,” she admitted, “but that doesn’t change anything. I can’t let you go. It’s suicide, no matter what you believe.”</p><p>Charles stepped closer, his voice firm. “Same here. I’ll never let you go. Never.”</p><p>Lizzy opened her mouth, then closed it again. She didn’t even know what to say. Charles wasn’t bluffing. He was completely serious.</p><p>“Look,” Charles continued, “you told me yourself my power is special. And I have those laser-beam eyes you keep underestimating. They are strong enough. I can do this.”</p><p>Lizzy felt overwhelmed. Natasha tried again, stepping in, her voice urgent, trying to reason. None of it worked. </p><p>Then Lizzy snapped.</p><p>Her expression hardened, her tone turning sharp and cold. “Fine. If you die in that realm, it’s none of my concern. You brought it on yourself.”</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. “Yeah,” he said calmly, “that’s the Lizzy I know.”</p><p>He nodded. “And you are right. It’s none of your concern.”</p><p>Natasha stared at her in disbelief. “Wait. You are just letting him go?”</p><p>Lizzy turned away, anger flaring as she said, “He’s the one insisting. I don’t care if he dies.”</p><p>She spun around sharply. “Let’s go. We will tell Hierem about it.”</p><p>With that, she walked off without looking back.</p><p>Charles smiled to himself and followed her, knowing she didn’t mean a single word of it.</p><p>Natasha hurried after them, still trying desperately to talk Charles out of it.</p><p>They arrived at the courtroom of the Hierem clan, a vast stone hall lined with towering pillars and heavy silence. The moment Charles stepped inside, his eyes went straight to Jeremy. His face was swollen, one side bruised badly, lips split, eyes lowered. It was obvious Lord Hierem had already dealt with him.</p><p>At the head of the hall, Lord Hierem sat calmly.</p><p>“So,” he said coldly, “have you told him we do not accept visitors, and that they should leave now!!!”</p><p>Lizzy gulped as she spoke.</p><p>“Charles will go instead of me.”</p><p>The room exploded.</p><p>Every head snapped toward her at once. The elders of the Hierem clan stirred in their seats, murmurs breaking out instantly. </p><p>Jeremy shot to his feet, eyes wide with rage. Even Lord Hierem’s calm expression cracked.</p><p>“What the fuck are you saying?” one of the elders barked. “You know very well no man can survive it.”</p><p>Lizzy let out a slow breath, saying nothing.</p><p>Charles stepped forward before anyone else could speak. “Well,” he said casually, “who knows. Maybe I might.”</p><p>Jeremy slammed his fist against the arm of his chair. “Father,” he shouted, “they’re plotting something stupid. The Hole Realm destroys any man on sight. The only reason a man would enter it is if he’s committing suicide.”</p><p>He sneered at Charles. “They are playing us.”</p><p>Another elder spoke sharply. “Lizzy already agreed to this arrangement. There will be no changes. You cannot play the Hierem clan. We need the Kyoul Stone, and we will get it.”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “I’m not trying any trick here,” he said evenly. “You lose nothing from this. If I die in the realm, you can still send her in afterward.”</p><p>That shut the room up.</p><p>Silence fell as the elders exchanged looks.</p><p>Lord Hierem scoffed, his lips curling slightly. “If you want to play it that way,” he said calmly, “then go ahead.”</p><p>The elders exchanged brief looks before nodding in agreement. To them, this was simple. They were convinced Charles was walking straight into his own death.</p><p>Jeremy, however, felt a flicker of unease. For a brief moment, a dangerous thought crossed his mind. What if Charles actually succeeded. What if he came back alive. That would mean losing Lizzy, the woman he had obsessed over for years.</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>Then he shook his head, forcing the thought away. Impossible. No man had ever returned from the Hole Realm. There was no reason to worry.</p><p>With the decision made, preparations for the ritual began immediately.</p><p>Charles had never performed mind journeying before, so he had to be taught the basics on the spot, the breathing, the posture, the mental focus required to detach the soul from the body. </p><p>Lizzy stood close, her hands clenched tightly.</p><p>“Are you sure about this?” she asked again, her voice low.</p><p>Charles looked at her and smiled. “I told you,” he said calmly. “I will come back.”</p><p>Lizzy swallowed hard and stepped back, unable to say anything else.</p><p>Charles sat down at the center of the formation, surrounded by the items needed for the mind journeying ritual that will land him to the necessary realm. </p><p>With that, everyone muted and waited.</p><p>After a few minutes,   Charles suddenly gasped sharply. “Uhh—”</p><p>His body stiffened, his breath hitching as his head snapped back.</p><p>Natasha panicked instantly. “What’s happening to him?” she asked urgently, turning to Lizzy.</p><p>Lizzy stared at Charles, her face pale, and answered quietly, “He’s already mind journeying. He’s on his way to the Hole Realm.”</p><p></p></div>
