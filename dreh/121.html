        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div>The thugs stared at the man who just appeared, their eyes widening in horror.<br/>One of them whispered shakily,<br/>“Isn’t… isn’t that Rain?”<br/>Another stuttered, “I swear… it’s him… Rain from the Godfather’s side…”<br/>Even Derek’s face was drained of color.<br/>He stumbled backward, his legs trembling.<br/>He had heard this name too many times. In fact, he was so close with the president and no one dared to offend him. <br/>Derek instantly dropped his pride, bowed so fast his forehead almost hit the sand.<br/>“S–Sir Rain! P-please… please,” he stammered, “h..how can I be of help?”<br/>Rain didn’t look at him.<br/>He didn’t even acknowledge Derek’s pathetic shaking. He spoke calmly, his voice flat but cold.<br/>“Nothing complicated,” Rain said. “Just listen and obey whatever Young Master tells you.”<br/>Derek blinked.<br/>Young… what?<br/>His mind froze.<br/>Young Master??<br/>His eyes darted toward Charles, the same Charles he called poor, useless, nobody. For a second he thought Rain must be joking.<br/>So he muttered it out, “young master?... who … who is Young master”.<br/>Rain’s eyes sharpened as he turned to charles,<br/>“Him of course,  Do what he tells you. And if you are that curious… Charles is the grandson of the Godfather.”<br/>Everything inside Derek stopped. His ears rang as his sight blurred. His legs started to shake.<br/>“W–what…?” he whispered.<br/>“What…? What did you… say…?”<br/>Rain’s tone didn’t change.<br/>“You heard me clearly. He is the Godfather’s grandson.”<br/>The world tilted for Derek.<br/>He remembered every insult he ever threw at Charles…Calling him nobody, poor, useless, a man with no background.  How he mocked him and always fought with him, thinking he was just a pauper man that won't do anything.<br/>When in reality…Charles was the one person in the entire city he should have never crossed.<br/>His lips trembled uncontrollably. That other night with the Tiger incident when Rain came to rescue them, it was all because of Charles.<br/>Derek swallowed hard. He finally understood why Charles always survived.<br/>Derek sniffled, breath shaking, and without thinking, he dropped fully to his knees.<br/>His forehead hit the ground.<br/>“Please… please Young Master…” he cried, voice cracking, “forgive me… forgive me… I didn’t know… I swear I didn’t know…!”<br/>He shook violently.He knew that if Charles wanted revenge for everything he did…He would be dead.<br/>Charles stepped forward slowly, his face blank, then said, “Hit your head on the floor one more time.”<br/>Derek didn’t hesitate.<br/>Thud!<br/>His forehead slammed the ground, skin splitting. Blood seeped down.<br/>“Again,” Charles said.<br/>Thud!<br/>Harder this time, the sound echoing. Derek whimpered, blood dripping down his face, tears mixing with it.<br/>He choked, “Please… Char— sorry… Young Master… forgive me… please…”<br/>Charles stared down at him coldly. “You don’t even deserve forgiveness, but you better answer every question I’m about to ask truthfully, because if you lie, even once, I will know, and I will kill you.”<br/>Derek trembled violently. “I will never lie… I swear… I swear… ask me anything”<br/>Charles inhaled quietly, then started with what had always bothered him.<br/>“Did Tracy and you really sleep together?”<br/>Derek sniffled, shaking his head, “Tracy and I never had sex… I swear we never did anything, we are not even in a relationship.”<br/>Charles roared, “Don’t you dare lie to me!”<br/>“I’m not lying!” Derek cried. “I swear it’s true, we didn’t do anything. I tried to seduce her many times, but she was stubborn and always thinking about you. She kept hoping you would come back… she wanted you to see how the world really feels without her, so you would return to her eventually.”<br/>Charles frowned deeply, his jaw tightening. “What about that day in the hotel?”<br/>Derek wiped his nose with his sleeve, still kneeling, still trembling. “I swear it was for the project, the condom and lube were props, we were testing them for the Quill sex education rollout, I tried to seduce her that day but she refused completely, she pushed me away… Tracy is stubborn but she’s just nice and gullible.”<br/>He sniffed again, voice cracking. “I helped her company make a lot of profit, that’s why she didn’t want to cut me off, she felt indebted… and when I told her to act as Francis’ mother, she didn’t like it but she agreed because she’s soft and can’t say no… we were only partners… nothing else…”.<br/>Charles gulped, his chest rising slowly.<br/>He sighed. “So… all that was a misunderstanding.”<br/>Derek nodded quickly, wiping the blood running from his forehead.<br/>“Yes… yes, you misunderstood it all. I only decided to dupe her when I saw I couldn’t get anything else from her. That’s the truth.”<br/>Charles kept his face calm and collected, eyes cold.<br/>“The money you stole from Tracy,” Charles said firmly, “you will transfer all of it back. Every single naira.”<br/>Derek trembled. “O-okay… okay…”<br/>He quickly pulled out three different phones, all  full of accounts under different fake names. He had spread Tracy’s money across more than ten accounts for safety.<br/>His hands shook so hard the phones almost fell. He opened each account one after another, typing fast, transferring back huge amounts into Tracy’s main business account.<br/>The numbers moved.<br/>Millions.<br/>Dozens of millions.<br/>Until the last one completed.<br/>Derek swallowed hard. “I… I’m done.”<br/>Charles nodded once. “Good.”<br/>Then without warning, Charles’s fist slammed into Derek’s jaw. <br/>POW!!<br/>“AAAHHH!!”<br/>Derek screamed, his jaw swinging sideways unnaturally as he fell to the floor, clutching his face.<br/>Blood poured from his mouth as he cried and whimpered.<br/>After that, Rain left. This would be the second time he used Godfather’s request. Though Lizzypie didn't like this, she felt they were wasting the requests. Also, what the essence of ruining Tracy just for him to help her back. <br/>They called the police to come and arrest Derek and warned him not to reveal who he was to anybody.<br/>Also, as for the thugs, they immediately respected Charles, and wanted to be working for him. Since Charles would need them, he accepted them to become his minions.<br/>All of them bowed to the ground.<br/>“All Hail Young master… we will serve you to death!”.</div>
