        <div><p>Collins snapped back immediately.</p><p>“What the heck are you saying?” he shot at Serena. “Before the Mr. Damien scandal, I was already close to finalizing the contract. I know you’re jealous of me.”</p><p>Serena scoffed and leaned back in her chair. She had wanted the CEO position from the start but Collins was clearly being favored by the family now. </p><p>“Jealous?” she said with a short laugh. “Don’t flatter yourself. You did nothing on your own. It was Tracy who helped you put everything together.”</p><p>Collins’ face darkened. The truth hit harder than he expected. “She helped me, yes,” he said through clenched teeth. “But I handled it myself in the end.”</p><p>Before Serena could respond, Mr. Gerald spoke up, his voice firm. “Serena, we accepted you back into this family because we realized we were wrong. But that does not give you the right to look down on your brother.”</p><p>Collins’ lips curved into a small grin. He turned away from Serena and faced his father. “Father,” he said carefully, “I want something if I’m able to finalize this deal.”</p><p>The room went quiet.</p><p>Mr. Moretti frowned. “What is it?”</p><p>Collins lifted his chin. “I want a permanent CEO position. A fixed-term appointment where no one can remove me again once the deal is secured.”</p><p>Gasps echoed around the table. Tracy stiffened. Even Mr. Moretti looked stunned by the request.</p><p>Serena was the first to break the silence. She burst out laughing, sharp and unrestrained. “What the hell are you even saying?” she said, shaking her head. “Do you even understand what you are asking for?”</p><p>Collins turned to her, eyes cold. “I understand it perfectly”.</p><p>Serena turned to her father, her voice sharp. “Father, this is exactly what I’ve been telling you. He hasn’t even fully assumed the CEO position yet and he already wants all the power.”</p><p>Collins scoffed. “Listen. Partnering with Aurelia Dynamics is not a kid’s job. It’s the only way to move the Avalon Project forward. In fact, just one partnership with them and our company’s stock will skyrocket. You know how big Aurelia Dynamics is.”</p><p>Almost immediately, Allison chimed in. “Yes. And if he really succeeds, he’ll need some immunity and security to keep things running smoothly.”</p><p>Mr. Gerald nodded. “Exactly. And I know he will do a great job.”</p><p>Serena clenched her jaw. The CEO position aside, she knew Collins’ cunning nature and his incompetence. Giving him long-term control would only destroy the family legacy.</p><p>She stepped forward. “Father… are you really going to stay silent and let them spew nonsense?”</p><p>Mr. Gerald frowned. “Me? Spewing nonsense? I can’t even tolerate that.”</p><p>Serena laughed bitterly without backing down. “Yes. You are spewing nonsense. That’s exactly how you sent me away for supporting Charles,  even though he was in the right, all because of your blind support for Collins. You never even apologized, and now you expect me to respect you. Old fool.”</p><p>“What?” Collins yelled. “How dare you talk to my father’s brother like that!”</p><p>Serena opened her mouth to respond, but Mr. Moretti raised his hand sharply.</p><p>“Enough. Everyone.”</p><p>The room fell completely silent. Everyone leaned in, waiting for Mr. Moretti to speak.</p><p>He folded his hands on the table. “Alright. Let’s do this properly. Whoever is able to secure the partnership with Aurelia Dynamics will become the permanent CEO of this family business for the next twenty years. No matter what happens.”</p><p>A wave of murmurs spread across the room.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Will he really step down?”</p><p>“Twenty years? That’s a lot.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti raised his voice slightly. “And I will personally step down for that person.”</p><p>The murmuring grew louder.</p><p>He continued, his gaze sweeping across everyone present. “This does not end with Serena or Collins alone. Anyone in this family. My brothers. Everyone here. Whoever brings me that partnership will prove himself worthy. That decision will be final.”</p><p>Serena let out a slow sigh. She understood what this meant.</p><p>Collins, however, didn’t like it. He had wanted the condition to favor him alone. Still, he masked his irritation and straightened his shoulders. “If that’s the case, then I’m not backing down. I will bring the partnership.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti nodded once. “Good. Then it begins now.”</p><p>With that, he stood up, signaling the end of the meeting, and walked out of the room.</p><p>The moment he was gone, the atmosphere shifted.</p><p>Family members immediately gathered around Collins and Tracy, openly declaring her support. One after another.</p><p>Mr. Gerald smiled and said, “None of us will challenge you. We know if you become CEO, it will benefit everyone. Unlike some other people.”</p><p>His eyes flicked briefly toward Serena.</p><p>They all nodded in agreement.</p><p>Serena stood still, staring at them. With everyone united behind Collins, she knew one thing clearly. There was no way she would be winning this.</p><p>Serena understood they weren’t siding with Collins because he was capable. They were siding with him because he was clumsy, greedy, and easy to control. </p><p>Each of them knew that if Collins became CEO, he would favor them without question. Their loyalty wasn’t to the family or the legacy. It was to their own pockets.</p><p>She let out a tired sigh and turned away without another word. Staying any longer would only disgust her.</p><p>As she left the room, her thoughts raced. Mr. Gerald already had his own company, along with a few others backing him quietly. If they collaborated and presented a united front, Aurelia Dynamics would definitely see potential in Collins on paper. </p><p>The realization settled heavily in her chest. Anger mixed with bitterness, and suddenly she wanted a drink. </p><p>Something strong. </p><p>As she walked down the corridor</p><p>She pulled out her phone, hesitated for a second, then dialed Charles’s number.</p><p></p></div>
