        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div><p>Lizzypie explained the mission.</p><p>Charles was to meet the lady, get close to her, and find a way to break the engagement.</p><p>Her name was Gabriella.</p><p>They had already done a deep search on her background. She was the only child and daughter of a massive research laboratory company in the city, Snyx World. One of the biggest labs in the nation. They produced large quantities of advanced drugs, most of which dominated the market. The Trisian family was one of their biggest investors.</p><p>That all, There was almost nothing on Gabriella herself. No social media. No public appearances and not even real photos.&nbsp;</p><p>The only information available was news about the engagement. And that was all.</p><p>Charles groaned. &ldquo;How the hell am I supposed to meet her?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at Lizzypie. &ldquo;She has no presence at all. We don&rsquo;t even know where she is. What if she&rsquo;s not even in this country?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzypie met his eyes calmly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles leaned back, staring at the ceiling. This mission was already a mess.</p><p>Lizzypie nodded. &ldquo;I will keep digging and see if I can find anything more&rdquo;</p><p>Charles thanked him, he&nbsp; didn&rsquo;t waste time after that. He picked up a sapphire stone and sat down to meditate. He needed to upgrade. Badly..&nbsp;</p><p>The energy flowed in as usual, steady and familiar, but halfway through, something went wrong.</p><p>A sharp pain tore through his chest. Charles clenched his teeth.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t normal.</p><p>He remembered what Mr. Noh had told him before. His body was still weak.</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t have a choice because Mr. Noh himself demanded he unlocked another level of power before he could help at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The pain intensified, burning through his veins, but Charles didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>After some moment, he finished.&nbsp; Blood spilled from his nose.</p><p>A cold notification appeared in his mind.</p><p>[Hellfire Beam upgrade completed: 100%]</p><p>[Maximum duration increased: 10 minutes]</p><p>[Cooldown reduced to 2 seconds]</p><p>Charles wiped the blood away and exhaled.</p><p>&ldquo;This is good enough,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;If I unlock one more power, I can beat him.&rdquo;</p><p>His body felt heavy, drained.</p><p>He stood up, returned to his room, and lay down.</p><p>Within minutes, exhaustion pulled him into sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Charles woke up Very early.</p><p>Lizzypie had only managed to dig out one thing. Gabriella was in the city. More than that, she was at home. But she rarely went out. Almost never.</p><p>That left Charles with only one option.</p><p>Go to her.</p><p>He arrived at the location as early as he could and stayed hidden, surveying the surroundings.</p><p>The Snyx World residence was massive. The main building stood tall and wide, cold and imposing. It belonged to Mr. Belly Building, the CEO of Snyx World.</p><p>Security was heavy.</p><p>Dozens of bodyguards stood at the front gate alone. Armed. More were patrolling inside the compound.</p><p>Walking up and asking for a meeting would get him rejected instantly. Or worse.</p><p>The only real option was to sneak in.</p><p>Charles narrowed his eyes and began calculating. With his flashstep, he could do it. In theory.</p><p>He checked again. Too many guards. Not just outside. Inside too.</p><p>&ldquo;Tough,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>He decided to wait, maybe he might be lucky and she could come out.&nbsp;</p><p>Hours passed. If Gabriella came out, even briefly, he could make contact. But she didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Time kept moving but she didn't.</p><p>Already Eleven a.m.</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw. He was running out of time.</p><p>He exhaled slowly. &ldquo;No choice.&rdquo;</p><p>He decided to act.</p><p>Just as he was about to move.</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>A violent explosion tore through the building.</p><p>The ground shook as smoke and debris burst upward as alarms blared instantly across the compound.</p><p>Charles&rsquo; eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;what the fuck,&rdquo; he muttered. He saw the building, engulfing with smoke and fire!!.</p><p>The Guards shouted as they all rushed in, chaos erupted inside the compound.</p><p>Charles stared at the burning section of the building.</p><p>Charles&rsquo; first thought hit him was, Did Godfather do this?</p><p>That deadline. Before twelve. Maybe this was why.</p><p>But an explosion?. It didn&rsquo;t sit right.</p><p>Shouts filled the air as smoke poured out of the building. Guards rushed in all at once, abandoning the gate without thinking twice.</p><p>This made the entrance free and&nbsp; Charles moved in.&nbsp;</p><p>No one stopped him. No one even noticed. Inside the compound, chaos had taken over.</p><p>People were being dragged out, coughing, faces pale. Some had cuts. Others were limping. Nothing fatal yet. Just panic and smoke.</p><p>The guards kept pulling people out, one after another.&nbsp;</p><p>Then a sharp scream cut through the noise.</p><p>A woman, dressed like a maid, stumbled forward, her face streaked with soot.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Gabriella is still inside!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still inside!&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone froze for a second.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her room,&rdquo; the maid continued, voice breaking. &ldquo;The toilet. That&rsquo;s where the explosion happened. Someone has to save Miss Gabriella!&rdquo;</p><p>Charles&rsquo; eyes snapped toward the building.</p></div>
