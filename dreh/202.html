        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha grabbed him closer,&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she whispered urgently. &ldquo;What kind of bet is that? Having your feet cut off is insane. What if you lose?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t even look worried. He glanced at her and said calmly, &ldquo;Chill. I won&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha shook her head, panic rising. &ldquo;Look, I know you can fight, but these people are talking about some kind of super power. Magic stuff. I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles reached out and tapped her shoulder lightly. &ldquo;Trust me. This is nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy clicked his tongue, clearly losing patience. &ldquo;You should listen to your bitch,&rdquo; he said mockingly. &ldquo;You still have time to back down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough talk,&rdquo; Charles replied flatly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s face darkened. In one angry motion, he stripped his shirt off, muscles flexing as he tossed it aside.</p><p>The guards erupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Young Master Jeremy, beat the hell out of him!&rdquo;</p><p>The leader of the guards stepped forward and looked straight at Charles. &ldquo;Before we proceed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you sure about this? Master Jeremy has faced over two hundred opponents in the past five years. He has never lost!.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles shrugged. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a first time for everything. His losing starts today.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy sneered. &ldquo;Leave him,&rdquo; he said to the guard leader. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only making me angrier. I will kill him within seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>The men moved quickly and formed a wide circle, leaving a large space in the middle for them. The guards gathered around, as they started cheering.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cripple him, Master!&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha stood frozen at the edge, hands clenched.</p><p>The guard leader raised his arm and shouted, &ldquo;Let the fight begin!&rdquo;.</p><p>Jeremy moved first.</p><p>He stepped in hard and fast, twisting his waist as his fist shot toward Charles&rsquo;s face. The punch was heavy, meant to end things early.</p><p>Charles tilted his head slightly and the fist passed through empty air.</p><p>Jeremy followed immediately with another punch, then a third, his shoulders rolling as he pressed forward. But Charles was dodging every one of it.&nbsp;</p><p>To everyone watching, the attacks were fast and vicious. To Charles, everything was slow because he already activated the Eyes of Satan.</p><p>In his vision, Jeremy&rsquo;s movements stretched. Muscles tightened before strikes. Charles could see every punch coming before it was thrown.</p><p>He weaved calmly. A small step to the side. A slight lean back. A turn of the shoulder. Jeremy&rsquo;s fists kept missing by inches.</p><p>The guards frowned.</p><p>Jeremy growled and increased his speed. He threw hooks, straight punches, even a knee aimed at Charles&rsquo;s ribs. Charles avoided them all with lazy precision. It looked effortless, almost disrespectful.</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s breathing grew heavier. His face twisted with frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;How? What the fuck&rdquo; he snarled.</p><p>Then Jeremy stepped back suddenly and bent forward slightly, his hands clenched at his sides as he rolled his fit.&nbsp;</p><p>A black aura flared around his body, thick and unstable, rippling like smoke caught in a storm.&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;What&hellip; what is that?&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>She had never seen anything like it.</p><p>The guards erupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Finish him, Young Master!&rdquo;.</p><p>Jeremy straightened, his eyes glowing faintly as the aura wrapped tighter around him. Power surged through his body as he charged again, faster than before, stronger.</p><p>&ldquo;I will rip you off!&rdquo;.</p><p>His fists cut through the air like hammers. His kicks cracked against stone where Charles had been a moment earlier. The force of his strikes sent shockwaves through the courtyard.</p><p>But still, Charles avoided every single one.</p><p>He stepped inside punches. Slipped past kicks. Turned with blows as if dancing. He kept throwing the aura power but none hit.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s rage exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;what the fuck. Stand still!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>Seeing he was already frustrated, was when Charles moved. He stepped forward and struck.</p><p>A sharp punch landed squarely in Jeremy&rsquo;s stomach. The aura flickered.</p><p>Before Jeremy could react, another punch smashed into his jaw. Then another into his ribs. Charles flowed from strike to strike, he was so fast.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy tried to fight back but his punches found nothing. Charles was already gone each time.</p><p>A hit to the chest.</p><p>&nbsp;A blow to the shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>A knee to the thigh.</p><p>Jeremy staggered.</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t stop. He beat him down completely, Jeremy couldn&rsquo;t land a single hit. Not one.</p><p>The guards fell silent and were shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy dropped to one knee, coughing hard, his power collapsing around him.</p><p>Charles stood over him, breathing steady.</p><p>Jeremy looked up at Charles, chest rising and falling hard, sweat running down his face as exhaustion dragged at every limb. C</p><p>Charles smiled faintly as he looked down at him and said, &ldquo;So, what do you think now? I won.&rdquo;</p><p>In truth, Charles had known the outcome long before the first punch was thrown. The moment he faced Jeremy, his eyes had already scanned him, breaking his body down layer by layer, exposing weak joints, uneven muscle balance, and poor circulation points.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, his Soul Sight had been active the entire time, predicting every movement before it happened.</p><p>But Jeremy refused to accept the defeat.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he growled through clenched teeth, forcing himself upright. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t accept this.&rdquo;</p><p>Smack.</p><p>The sound echoed sharply across the courtyard as Charles slapped him across the face. It was so&nbsp; humiliating, dismissive, like disciplining a child.</p><p>This made him more mad and lost it.</p><p>Jeremy&rsquo;s eyes went wild as he spun toward his men, fury overtaking reason. &ldquo;What the fuck are you all staring at?&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Kill him. Kill him now!&rdquo;</p><p>The guards snapped out of their shock instantly. Metal clicked in unison as guns were cocked and raised, barrels swinging toward Charles from every direction, fingers tightening on triggers.</p><p>Natasha gasped, her heart dropping into her stomach.</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s expression changed as his eyes moved rapidly, looking for a way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They were just about to shoot&mdash;</p><p>When another voice roared through the courtyard.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is all this?&rdquo;</p></div>
