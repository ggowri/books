        <h1>chapter 113</h1>
        <div>Charles let out a tired sigh, rubbing his forehead as Tracy clung to his wrist.<br/>“I have to go,” he said quietly. “I don’t see any reason to stay here.”<br/>Tracy suddenly lifted her head, her hair messy, her eyes swollen. Then she straightened a little and snapped, her voice shaky.<br/>“Yes… you do have a reason to stay. In fact you have many reasons. Because you’re the reason I’m like this.”<br/>Charles exhaled again, frustration running through him. “Look at you. You are doing it again. Blaming me for everything. That’s all you ever do.”<br/>Tracy wiped her tears with the back of her hand, still shaking.<br/>“Do you even know…” she swallowed hard, trying not to break again, “I invested over one hundred and fifty million in a company Derek introduced to me… and I checked online just now… I can’t find anything about it. Nothing. No registration. No website. No record anywhere. Does that mean he scammed me?”<br/>Charles stopped breathing for a moment. He understood that Tracy being in her lowest moment was just looking for someone to pour herself out to. Currently, she has nobody other than him. Considering what Tracy did to him, he wanted to leave.<br/>But he feared she might hurt herself.<br/>He quietly replied. “Yeah. The company is fake. It was all a scam.”<br/>Tracy choked out a sob, bending forward slightly.<br/>“And I’m doomed,” she cried. “Charles… that money is all I had left. I’ve already received so many calls from my shareholders tonight asking questions. It’s only a matter of time before they pull out. I’m going to be ruined. Completely ruined.”<br/>Charles leaned back, shaking his head.<br/>“Well… that’s because of your choices,” he said honestly. “You shut me out every time I tried to warn you.  If I could just leave…”<br/>Tracy snapped immediately, her voice louder through the tears.<br/>“Like I said… you caused this! You divorced me and let Derek come into my life and destroy everything!”<br/>Charles couldn’t hold it anymore. He scoffed, anger flaring.<br/>“What the hell are you even saying?” he shot back. “You cheated on me with Derek. N I caught you together fucking yourself,  don’t you dare twist that story.”<br/>Tracy froze.<br/>Charles continued, voice sharp but controlled.<br/>“You brought his child home. You disrupted our marriage long before I talked about divorce. You left the marriage first. I didn’t ruin your life, you did that all by yourself.”<br/>Tracy sat still, tears sliding down slowly. She cried harder, grabbing the blanket as if it could hold her together.<br/>“I told you… I didn’t sleep with Derek,” she sobbed. “We weren’t even in a relationship. You misunderstood everything.”<br/>Charles let out a sharp scoff.<br/>“Don’t play me because you are in this condition now. I caught you two in a hotel. He was shirtless with a towel. You ordered condoms and lube. You did everything to let his child stay with us, you always took his side over mine. You left me injured because of Derek, and I even saw your video saying he was your first love. You deserve everything that’s happening.”<br/>Tracy shot back immediately through her tears.<br/>“You never believed me! You didn’t even trust me for one second! I told you, I’m a Buddhist believer. I would never cheat on you.”<br/>Charles rolled his eyes.<br/>“Here we go again with the religion thing.”<br/>Tracy slapped her hand on the bed, desperate.<br/>“I swear I didn’t sleep with Derek! Yes, you saw us in the hotel, but that’s because we lodged there for further discussion about a project. Those condoms and lube were part of the project materials!”<br/>Charles narrowed his eyes.<br/>“See,  you are still lying?”<br/>“I am not lying,” Tracy cried. “Search for it. Search Quill Sex Education Project. We rolled it out to advertise our company. I bought those items to study how the products function, the packaging, the branding, everything! Derek took off his shirt that day and tried to seduce me, YES, but I refused. Strongly refused. He tried, but I didn’t sleep with him.”<br/>Charles frowned, grabbed his phone, and typed into the browser. [zenith consortium Sex Education Project]<br/>Zenith consortium   was Tracy's company's name.<br/>A full listing popped up immediately, making him pause.<br/>The project was clearly official, in fact, a government-approved public health and sex-education awareness initiative.<br/>It involved reviewing different condom brands for safety compliance.<br/>-testing lubricants for irritation risks<br/>- recording educational videos for young adults about consent, sexual health, STDs<br/>-partnership with influencers to promote safe-use awareness<br/>-feedback surveys for brands participating in the campaign.<br/>The project summary was detailed, professional, and publicly documented.<br/>Charles stared at the screen, his brows tightening. If Tracy was lying with this, then she was doing it perfectly.<br/>Charles wasn’t convinced even after seeing the project page. He lowered the phone slowly and scoffed.<br/>“So that’s it? You’re tying your whole affair to this project?”<br/>Tracy’s face twisted in frustration as she cried.<br/>“Fuck you, Charles! I told you back then too that it was for the project, but you didn’t listen! You never listened!”<br/>Charles clenched his jaw.<br/>“Let’s say… let’s just say what you’re saying now is true. Then explain the others? About his kid and the PTA thing. Tell me how that makes sense.”<br/>Tracy wiped her tears with shaking fingers, breathing heavily.<br/>“Francis is a victim of bullying,” she said, voice cracking. “The first time I met him, his face was covered in bruises. Kids beat him up almost every day. I introduced myself as his mom because I wanted to protect the kid and make the bullies back off. He’s just a boy, Charles. He wanted someone to defend him… he wanted me to be his mother because he had no one.”<br/>Charles stared at her but said nothing.<br/>She continued, sobbing but clearer.<br/>“And in the PTA, yes, I said what I said because I wanted those children to respect him… maybe even be jealous of him so they would stop hurting him. He needed confidence. He needed protection. I wasn’t doing it for Derek.”<br/>She wiped her tears again, her voice softer now.<br/>“And yes… Derek is my first love. I won’t deny that. He came back into my life saying he wanted to help my company grow. We collaborated together and it really did work. That’s all it was. I didn’t cheat on you.”</div>
