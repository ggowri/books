        <h1> Chapter 16</h1>
        <div>Charles stared at her hand clamped on his wrist, her nails digging in like claws. He finally saw it clearly: Tracy wasn’t broken, she wasn’t pleading.<br/>She was playing the victim, as always, wrapping herself in false vulnerability to pull him back into her.<br/>“Quit the drama, Tracy. I’m not falling for this again. I won’t be driving you home. Call your damn driver.”<br/>Tracy’s lips twitched into a bitter smile as she stepped out fully from the car. Her eyes flicked to the suitcase dragging behind him, and she laughed.<br/>“Look at you,” she sneered. “Dragging that same bag everywhere. It’s obvious… you have nowhere to go. You are broke, Charles. You don’t even have money to book a hotel room. Yet you stand here acting all cold, pretending you don’t need me. Pretending you are above me.”<br/>Her smile widened, feeling triumphant. “I even booked you a hotel, but no… you are too proud to step in. What now? You would rather rot on the roadside?”<br/>Charles’ throat tightened, but his voice came out calm, steady as stone.<br/>“Just give it a rest, Tracy. I would rather sleep on the road than set foot in that hotel of yours.”<br/>Her eyes flickered. She didn’t expect him to answer like that. She was expecting him to see that he had no other choice but her.<br/>But she recovered quickly, stepping closer and pressing further.<br/>“You think you are tough?” she pressed. “You’re nothing but a poor, broke man. A failure. You have no house, no money, no pride. You disgust me, Charles. You act cold because you have nothing else left. Nothing!”<br/>“Broke man. Miserable man. A shameful man with nothing to his name!”<br/>But Charles didn’t flinch. He bent down, calmly picked up his suitcase, and turned his back on her. Not a single word escaped his lips. His silence burned louder than any insult.<br/>That silence made her angrier.<br/>Her rage exploded. “That’s how you will remain, Charles! Poor! Forever poor! You hear me? You will come crawling back on your knees when reality breaks you. You will come back begging… because no one else will have you!”<br/>Charles didn’t stop. He kept walking. Because all those words that Tracy said really touched him. He was a poor, miserable man.<br/>He walked down the street, still struggling with his suitcase.<br/>Charles had just walked into the narrow street when he heard a voice.<br/>“Hey.”<br/>He turned. Derek was standing there, smiling like he was waiting for him.<br/>“Derek?” Charles frowned. “How can I help you?” He wondered what Derek could be here for.<br/>“In many ways,” Derek said with a smirk. Then two big men stepped out behind him, each holding a stick. Charles’ grip tightened on his suitcase.<br/>“What’s all this?” he asked sharply.<br/>Two more men came from behind, blocking his way. He was trapped in the middle.<br/>Derek’s smile turned cruel. “I’m here to knock some sense into you. I’m here to warn you to leave Tracy for good. Get out of her life and let me enjoy her in peace.”<br/>Charles’ face darkened. “I already filed for divorce. That shouldn’t be your worry. You can enjoy yourself with her.”<br/>But Derek shook his head. “No. You keep showing up. You keep making her hang on to you. Just leave for good and let her heart stay with me.”<br/>He leaned in, voice low but full of venom. “Maybe I should tell you. I really slept with her that day. That condom wasn’t for some project. I fucked her. Hard. And she even told me I’m a beast compared to you.”<br/>The men chuckled, but Charles only sighed. Tracy had been denying it, but deep down, he already knew the truth. It didn’t shock him anymore.<br/>“That’s none of my business,” he said flatly. “Like I told you, I’m done with Tracy.”<br/>But Derek’s smile dropped. “Done? She isn’t done with you! She still wants you, and it makes me sick. What does she see in you, huh? A poor man who depends on her for everything? You don’t even have a place to sleep. Look at you… dragging that suitcase like a beggar. While me? I’m her first love, and I am rich. I am the perfect man for her.”<br/>The men moved closer, sticks tapping on the ground. The air grew tense.<br/>Charles looked Derek straight in the eyes. “Like I told you… I am nothing to Tracy again.”<br/>Derek nodded and said, “Yeah. All the same. I still have time to teach you some lessons, to warn you.”<br/>Then he motioned to the men. “Beat him up!”<br/>The men rushed in.<br/>One of them swung a stick at Charles. It hit the suitcase hard. Another stamped on the wheel and kicked the side until the case skidded.<br/>Charles’ luggage scattered on the floor.<br/>This made him mad. He stormed at them. As a firefighter, he knew the basics of fighting, and he remembered where to hit to cause pain.<br/>He ducked under a stick, caught a wrist, and twisted it.<br/>“Ahhhh!” the man cried out and went down, clutching his arm. It sounded like something cracked. Charles did not wait. He turned to the second man, kicked his knee. He went on his knee before he gave him a fatal blow on his face. He fell down.<br/>They kept coming. One stamped on his luggage again, bending the handle. That made Charles angrier. He shoved back harder.<br/>Another swung a stick at his head… Charles caught the arm and slammed him into the wall. <br/>All of them were trembling under him.<br/>Derek was shocked.<br/>“You… you…” he stammered. He lunged with his boot, aiming at Charles’ ribs. Charles turned his face away, caught Derek’s leg with both hands, and then swung a clean, hard punch into Derek’s nose.<br/>Derek screamed. “Ughh! My nose...” He grabbed his face. Blood ran down onto his hand and dripped to the ground. He staggered back, holding his nose.<br/>The other men froze. They had not expected Charles to fight like that. Charles stood over them.<br/>“Listen to me,” Charles said. “I told you. I’m done with Tracy. I’m finished with her. Come near me next time, and I will kill you.”<br/>Derek tried to speak, one hand pressed to his nose, blood on his fingers. He looked weak, shocked. Charles picked up his battered suitcase and stood over them.<br/>He looked at Derek and the men, then up at the night sky. For a moment, he wondered how Tracy could end up with someone like Derek.<br/>He just walked away. Derek shouted after him, “I will still find you, you lowlife!”.</div>
