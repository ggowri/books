        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div><p>Charles stepped away from the building and exhaled slowly, the night air finally hitting him as he reached for his phone to call a taxi, his mind still heavy with everything that had happened inside.</p><p>“Are you injured anywhere?”</p><p>He paused and turned.</p><p>Tracy stood a few steps away, her hands clasped together.</p><p>For a moment Charles just stared at her, remembering the warning message she had sent.</p><p>She took the risk even while being engaged to Collins, and the irony of it all because she would have benefited the most if Collins had succeeded and taken over as CEO.</p><p>“So,” Charles said flatly, “what do you want, you want me to thank you?”</p><p>Tracy let out a tired sigh. “No. I just wanted to check if you are okay.”</p><p>He studied her for a second, then nodded. “I am,” he said, “all thanks to you.”</p><p>Relief flickered across her face. She nodded back. “That’s good.”</p><p>There was a brief silence before she spoke again, her voice lower now. “But… Can you do me a favour, in exchange for saving your life?”</p><p>Charles almost laughed. He scoffed softly because even without her warning,  he would have sensed the danger and survived, but he decided not to say that.</p><p>“What is it,” he asked.</p><p>Tracy hesitated, then met his eyes. “Can you please talk to Serena, ask her to let Collins be accepted back into the family.”</p><p>Charles’ expression hardened instantly. “Why would I do that,” he said. “He almost killed her.”</p><p>“But he apologized,” Tracy said quickly. “Please. If he is abandoned by the family he’ll be ruined, he will turn to nothing.”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “He should have thought of that before trying to kill us,” he replied coldly. “Forget it. I’m not asking Serena for anything.”</p><p>Tracy’s face tightened with anger. “Why are you like this?” she snapped. “I saved your life, I warned you about the danger, and you can’t even do this small favour for me?”</p><p>Charles stepped back slightly, his voice calm but firm. “What you did was right, and I already acknowledged it,” he said. “But don’t mistake that for leverage. Serena almost died, and no apology fixes that.”</p><p>Tracy’s face twisted and the words came out sharp and reckless. “I made a mistake,” she said bitterly. “I should have let him kill you.”</p><p>Charles went still. He looked at her properly now, his eyes cold.</p><p>“You keep getting worse every day,” he said quietly. “Here you are defending someone who abetted a murder, and now you are saying you regret warning me, which means you think I should have died.”</p><p>Tracy laughed, harsh and broken. “Yes,” she shouted back. “Thinking about it now, I should have let you die. What have you ever done in my life except cause me pain?”</p><p>“Really?” Charles asked calmly.</p><p>“Yes!” she screamed. “You were poor, you still are, you are nothing but trash. Collins saved me from the slum. When I lost everything, he spent almost all he had on me, he revived my company, he invested over one hundred and fifty million dollars, money you will never own in your life. I should never have betrayed him by telling you about the danger.”</p><p>Charles scoffed softly.</p><p>Because,  the revived company and the so-called investment were done through shadows, that Collins had lied and deceived her.  She wanted to believe that Collins did it. but he didn’t bother correcting her. </p><p>He shook his head slowly and said, “You are  gullible, and you are foolish.”</p><p>The words landed hard.</p><p>Tracy stared at him, stunned, her anger, “Don&#x27;t call me foolish, I know you are hurt by what I said”.</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly, then finally let it out.</p><p>“You know Collins didn’t do all that,” he said evenly. “He was deceiving you. I did it. I invested one hundred and fifty million, I revived your company.”</p><p>Tracy stared at him for a few seconds, searching his face as if waiting for the punchline, then she burst into laughter.</p><p>“Haha,” she mocked. “What’s that now, are you delusional?” She shook her head. “You wish. You invested one hundred and fifty million in me? You?” She laughed harder. “You were surviving by leeching off rich women.”</p><p>Charles held her gaze, calm and unmoved, already knowing there was nothing to gain from arguing with someone who had chosen what to believe.</p><p>“Believe whatever you want,” he said quietly. “Bye.”</p><p>He raised his hand and flagged down a taxi, which slowed and stopped right in front of him.</p><p>Tracy’s voice rose behind him, sharp and furious. “Fuck you. You are just jealous. You wish you did all that. I will make sure Collins gets back on his feet.”</p><p>Charles didn’t reply. He got into the car and shut the door, and the taxi pulled away, leaving her standing there shouting into the night.</p><p>Inside the car, Charles scoffed softly, anger simmering beneath the surface. For a moment he considered pulling the investment, calling back every investor he had personally convinced to revive her company, because he could end everything with a single call, but the thought passed just as quickly.</p><p>If he did that, she would lose everything again.</p><p>And despite everything, he knew she  still  cared for him, even if it&#x27;s little, because she still warned him about the danger, and that single act was enough for him to let it go.</p><p>He leaned back against the seat.</p><p>Then his phone rang.</p><p>He glanced at the screen.</p><p>LizzyPie.</p><p>He answered. “Hello.”</p><p>“Charles,” her voice came fast and urgent, “turn on Arise News right now.”</p><p></p></div>
