        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div>Tracy woke up, feeling tired, her head heavy and foggy. She had drunk herself nearly to the limit after Charles left. Deep down, she knew she had lost him forever.<br/>She dragged herself to the bathroom to wash her face. On her way, the door opened, and Derek stepped in.<br/>“Morning,” he said softly. “How’s my son?”<br/>“Sleeping soundly,” she replied. Just then, she noticed the bandage across his nose. Concern flickered across her face. “What happened to you?”<br/>Derek waved it off. “Ah, don’t worry. It will just make you mad.”<br/>Tracy frowned. “Make me mad? What really happened? Tell me.”<br/>He sighed. “It’s… Mr. Charles.”<br/>“Ugh… Charles? What did he do?” she asked, her voice sharp.<br/>Derek hesitated, then started spinning his story. “He was wandering around the house last night. I saw him and asked if I could help. Instead… he just lost it and punched me.”<br/>Tracy’s eyes widened. “Really? He did that?”<br/>Derek nodded, adding more pity to his tone. “Yeah… I had to visit the hospital. That’s why I couldn’t come last night.”<br/>Tracy paused, frowning. Something felt off. The Charles she knew would never act like this. But she scoffed and shook her head. <br/>“He was the one acting all mighty yesterday, refusing to stay with me, yet he comes around… just to punch you? Such silly behavior.”<br/>She picked up her phone and dialed. It rang many times before Charles picked it up.<br/>“How dare you! How dare you punch Derek! Why are you so bitter? You are the one who pushed me away, yet you won’t let me go!” she barked.<br/>On the other side, Charles froze, shocked. Derek had apparently spun this story to her already. He hurried to explain.<br/>“Tracy, that’s not really what happened...”<br/>“What? What?” she cut him off sharply. “You want to lie? You have already shown how desperate you are.”<br/>Charles tried again, “If you will let me explain...”<br/>“You have nothing to explain,” she snapped. “Just apologize to him. And to me. I will take you back. You don’t need to be loitering around.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “Tracy, you just keep getting worse. If you won’t let me talk, why would you call then? I will just hang up.”<br/>Tracy’s voice hardened. “Look at you, still acting all mighty. I’m done. Finally done with you. Let’s meet at the court right now! I wanted to wait two days, hoping you would come back to your senses. But instead, you go beat someone up. Who knows what you might do to the kid next? You are a horrible human being.”<br/>Charles exhaled slowly. “Better. Let’s meet at the court.”<br/>Charles, in the small room he lodged in for three days for 1000 dollars, placed his phone down, seething in anger.<br/>Derek was the one who attacked him, but he had spun the story for Tracy. And Tracy wouldn't let him explain. She heard the side story from Derek but wouldn’t listen to him. This made him angry.<br/>Also, he needed the divorce to happen as soon as possible so he could get his own half share in the house. He could use that to survive for the time being. He started planning.<br/>Once today passed, Tracy would finally be gone from his life. She had already left him crumbled and damaged. After today, he would certainly just block her number. Whatever she did with her life would no longer concern him. He started planning for the divorce.<br/>After many hours, he arrived at the magistrate court at the exact time Tracy had promised. As he was about to enter…<br/>Vroom! A car sped beside him, kicking up dust at him.  He recognized it was Tracy.<br/>Tracy then came out of the car, dressed in a very short gown that revealed her long legs. She was doing everything to look stunning. Then Derek also came out of the car. She slid her arms under Derek as she walked toward where Charles was. <br/>“Look at you. You look pathetic. Did you even bathe last night?” she sneered at him.<br/>Charles said, “I don’t have time for chit-chat. Let’s just finish this up.”<br/>“I know you won't have time for this, but you will have time to punch someone’s nose? Do you want to kill him?” she sneered.<br/>“You should have called me last night. I would have come and met you. I even would’ve let you stay, instead you punched him!” she added.<br/>“Is that what he told you? He attacked me first,” Charles explained.<br/>“Stop lying. Is that what you resort to now? Just a night outside and you already turn into something else. Look, you can still reconsider before we step in. I can still take you back. Please. You will rot with your lowlife,” she said.<br/>Charles stared at her, picturing every day of their life in marriage. He sighed, thinking about how far they had come and what they had lost.<br/>He just said, “Meet me inside when you are done.”<br/>They made their way in and met with the judge. All the documents were already prepared. <br/>They just had to be signed. Charles found out he wasn't given anything from the properties. He didn’t even care about what Tracy owned. <br/>But, their house they built together…he received nothing from it.<br/>“What’s this? Who wrote this? We both owned the house together. How will I end up with nothing in it?” he cried out.<br/>Charles blinked, trying to steady himself. The judge’s words hit him like a physical blow.<br/>“Mr. Charles,” the magistrate said, “the house in question is currently occupied by Mrs. Tracy and the minor child she adopted during the marriage. You have no legal claim to evict them. The property cannot be transferred until they voluntarily vacate or a separate agreement is reached.”<br/>Charles felt the room spin. He clenched his fists, the raw anger and disbelief rising in his chest.<br/>“What… What do you mean I get nothing? We built that house together!”<br/>Tracy’s lips curled into a slow, triumphant smile. “Oh, that’s why you are pushing this divorce so hard, isn’t it?” she said, her tone dripping with mockery. “You think you will earn from it? Haha… look at this poor man.”<br/>Charles felt his heart crack, each word of hers a knife twisting in him. He had envisioned this day differently...him walking away with at least a fair share. But now, reality had been rewritten before his eyes.<br/>He looked down at the papers, the signatures and clauses glaring back at him. They were all there, meticulously prepared, leaving no room for argument. Even if he tried to refuse, the legal precedent, the judge, and Tracy’s careful planning worked against him.<br/>Tracy leaned closer, whispering just loud enough for him to hear, “You can still decide, you know. You haven’t signed it yet. Come back… live with me… or sign this and have nowhere to sleep.” Her smirk was sharp, predatory.<br/>Charles exhaled slowly. He had been played and duped. He knew what he had to do. He was here anyway, and there was no backing down.<br/>He picked up the pen and signed it.<br/>Finally, they were officially divorced.</div>
