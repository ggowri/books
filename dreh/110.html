        <h1>chapter 110</h1>
        <div><p>Tracy steadied herself against the sink one last time before forcing her body upright. Her legs felt weak, her chest tight, her head light. She staggered toward the exit, wiping her tears but failing miserably.</p><p>As soon as she stepped back into the hallway, people turned,  pointing, whispering, shaking their heads.</p><p>“Her boyfriend and her mother?”</p><p>“God, I can’t imagine…”</p><p>Their pity burned worse than their insults.</p><p>Tracy felt her throat close. She pushed through the murmuring crowd, just wanting to escape </p><p>But as she reached the large double doors, her foot caught the edge.</p><p>Her body tilted forward, she almost hit the floor.</p><p>A firm hand grabbed her arm, steadying her before she collapsed.</p><p>“Are you okay?” a calm voice asked.</p><p>Tracy froze.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>It was Charles. For a second, she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Her vision blurred with humiliation and anger. She yanked her arm away from his hold, her voice trembling.</p><p>“Why… Why are you pretending to care?” she whispered harshly. “Why are you mocking me? Trying to be cool when you are the one behind all this?”</p><p>Charles sighed. “Tracy—”</p><p>“You could have just told me!” she snapped, tears rushing back into her eyes. “You could have warned me! Instead you used it… you used it to shame me in public!”</p><p>People glanced their way, but kept their distance.</p><p>“I tried to tell you, but you won&#x27;t even listen… remember that day I came to meet you, that&#x27;s what I wanted to say, this is your fault not mine”, Charles told her. </p><p>Tracy lips hit each other. She could remember, but still, she blamed him again, “You could have told me. Find a way to do it. Instead you embarrassed me in public”. </p><p>Charles exhaled slowly. “Tracy, listen… I never targeted you. I only turned Derek’s weapon back onto him. He planned to use a video to destroy me. All I did was reverse it.”</p><p>Tracy’s jaw clenched. Her chest rose and fell fast with hurt and rage.</p><p>“You talk like a hero,” she whispered bitterly. “But all you ever do is ruin me. I hate you”</p><p>Charles stared at her silently. “When will you start accounting yourself, and have self reflection, you always blame others for your own mistakes”.</p><p>She stepped back, tears burning down her cheeks. “Just… stay away from me.”</p><p>And without waiting for any reply, she walked past him,  and dashed out.</p><p>---</p><p>Meanwhile, people kept swarming around Serena, offering congratulations, shaking her hand, praising her speech. She smiled politely.</p><p>After a few hours, the banquet finally ended. Guests drifted out in glittering groups, murmuring about the scandal, the awards, and Serena’s victory.</p><p>Serena walked to the exit beside Charles. When they reached the car, she stopped and turned to him.</p><p>“Charles,” she said quietly, “do you know anything about what happened today? The screen, the sudden sex video?”</p><p>Charles’s face remained unreadable. “No. I don’t know anything about it.”</p><p>Serena frowned.</p><p>She knew Charles was lying. She could hear her and Tracy arguing about it. But she didn’t push. She didn&#x27;t even care and was even more happy that Charles later taught her a lesson.</p><p>They both entered the car, and Charles drove.  </p><p>Just as they turned into a darker stretch of road — a narrow bridge with no street lights which lead to the main road. A black SUV swerved from the opposite lane, screeching across their path.</p><p>Charles hit the brakes hard.</p><p>The tires screamed and the car jolted violently. Serena popped out her eyes in horror. </p><p>“Charles!” She yelled out as three men jumped out of the SUV,  faces masked and each one held a gun.</p><p>They spread out quickly, surrounding the car. Pointing guns at them. </p><p>Serena yelled,  “Who are they?! What do they want from us!” but the three men didn’t answer, they just raised their guns higher and stepped closer. </p><p>“Get out of the car!” one shouted </p><p>Charles tightened his grip on the steering wheel and whispered, “Serena, stay low”</p><p>Before she could even respond. They shot sprees at them.</p><p>TATATATATATA!!!</p><p>Gunfire erupted like fireworks exploding beside them, bullets cracking against the car windows, Serena screamed and ducked down, her hands over her head, Charles slid down instantly, pulling her head to the side, glass shattering everywhere, the sound loud and sharp</p><p>“Fuck! They are shooting!” Serena cried, covering her ears</p><p>One masked man shouted, “Don’t let them escape!” and kept firing, the bullets tore through the side mirror and the backlight, sparks flashing each time they hit metal</p><p>Charles pushed Serena’s head lower, “Stay down! Don’t move!”</p><p>The moment the gunfire paused for a breath, Charles opened his door and rolled out to the ground fast, he kept low, moving behind the car as one of the gunmen screamed, “He’s out! Don’t let him run!” then more shots followed.</p><p> Tata-tata-tata, hitting the ground around Charles</p><p>He crawled quickly under the car, grabbed a piece of broken metal, and crawled toward the nearest attacker, the shooter leaned forward to check under the car, muttering, “Where the hell is he, fuck…”</p><p>Charles grabbed the man’s ankle, yanked hard, the man fell to the ground with a loud thud, his gun slipped from his hand and slid across the road, Charles rolled out immediately, grabbed the fallen gun, and pointed it back at him</p><p>The gunman yelled, “Shit! Shit! Shoot him!”</p><p>The other two fired wildly, bullets sparking around Charles, he fired back, one clean shot hitting the man’s shoulder, the shooter screamed and fell back.</p><p>“yaaa. What the fuck, he is so fast”. </p><p>Serena, still inside the car, covered her ears as the noise was nonstop, “Charles! Charles!”</p><p>Charles ducked behind the SUV, shooting again as one gunman tried to rush him, the man shouted, “They must not escape! Kill them! Kill them!” then fired like crazy, the bullets ripping holes into the car doors</p><p>Charles jumped out from behind the SUV and fired twice, one bullet hitting the attacker’s leg, the man went down, rolling on the ground screaming, “Fuck! My leg!”</p><p>The last shooter, angry and panicking, yelled, “fuck you!” He ran toward Charles, firing non-stop, tatatata, missing by inches, sparks flying everywhere</p><p>Charles rushed forward in a fast sprint, dodging left and right, then slammed the gunman into the car hood, Charles twisted his wrist, the gun dropped, then elbowed him in the jaw and the man stumbled back. Three of them were down. </p><p>Just a matter of time to get back on their feet. </p><p>Charles grabbed Serena’s hand, “Run! Now!”</p><p>They sprinted.  One gunman sitting on the ground clutching his bleeding leg yelling, “Don’t let her get away! She must die!”</p><p>Charles pushed Serena ahead, both of them running as fast as they could.</p></div>
