        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div><p>Meanwhile, inside the car.</p><p>Lizzypie hadn’t said a word since they left, but her anger sat thick in the air. She finally exhaled sharply and turned to Charles.</p><p>“Look… that’s the reason you shouldn’t have even helped her at all,” she said, voice tight. “Let her become poor. She’s arrogant… and ungrateful.”</p><p>Charles kept his eyes on the road. “She’s right, though. We ruined her.”</p><p>“She deserved it,” Lizzypie snapped. “Always acting braggy and looking down on you.”</p><p>Charles shook his head slowly. “Remember, she saved us from Norman.”</p><p>Lizzypie groaned, leaning her forehead against the window. “You always take her side.”</p><p>Charles didn’t argue. The road stretched out in silence.</p><p>Three hours later, they finally rolled into Winchester. The sun had already dipped, the streets growing darker as they searched for a hotel.</p><p>Then—ding.</p><p>Lizzypie’s phone lit up. She glanced at the screen.</p><p>Her expression changed instantly. She went pale. Her lips parted, but no sound came out. She swallowed hard.</p><p>“Please… stop the car,” she said quietly.</p><p>Charles pulled over immediately. “Lizzypie… What happened? What’s that?”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>“Lizzypie.” His voice deepened with genuine concern.</p><p>She still said nothing. She sat there, staring at her phone like it had just delivered a death sentence.</p><p>Charles reached for her shoulder. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Lizzypie finally turned, eyes glassy. “I’m sorry, Charles. You have to do this alone. I… I have to be somewhere.”</p><p>Charles scoffed, disbelief slipping into his voice. “Somewhere? Where is that?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” she said, unbuckling her seat belt.</p><p>“Really? You get a message that changes your whole face and then you tell me you ‘have to be somewhere’? What’s happening, Lizzypie?”</p><p>She avoided his eyes and kept unbuckling.</p><p>Charles pressed, softer now. “You’ve been acting strange for days. Strange calls and messages. If there’s anything I can do to help, tell me.”</p><p>“I told you—it’s nothing,” she said quickly. “I just have somewhere I need to be. Please.”</p><p>She opened the door halfway, voice trembling. “You can ask around… pretend you are a journalist… look for information about Mr. Damien.”</p><p>“Lizzypie—”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered.</p><p>Before Charles could add anything more…She opened the door fully and stepped out.</p><p>From outside the car, Lizzypie turned back and waved her hand. “I will call you and ask how things go,” she said. “I might even return before you are finished.”</p><p>Charles nodded, though confusion sat heavy on his face.</p><p>With that, she hurried off toward the main road, flagging down the first taxi she saw. She climbed in without looking back.</p><p>Charles watched the taxi disappear into traffic.</p><p>Lizzypie was definitely hiding something. And not something small. Something dangerous. That she didn’t want him to hear. She couldn’t even explain.</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel and exhaled. “After this mission… I will find out what you are hiding”.</p><p>He started the car again and continued searching for a hotel nearby, the streets growing narrower as he drove deeper into the older side of Winchester.</p><p>He turned onto a road that ran close to a dim alley.</p><p>“Aaaaaagh! No… please return it! She will die without it! No…”</p><p>It was a loud scream. He heard it.</p><p>Charles pulled the car to a stop and killed the engine. He listened carefully.</p><p>The scream came again and more loudly.</p><p>“Please! Just give it already! She will die without it! Please!”</p><p>He clenched his jaw. He couldn’t ignore that. Whoever was crying out needed real help.</p><p>Charles stepped out of the car and followed the voice into the alley. The deeper he went, the darker it became, the place so neglected it was clear no one passed through often.</p><p>He reached the corner where the noise came from.</p><p>He saw five teenagers in school uniforms. Two girls and three boys.</p><p>One girl was on the ground, gasping hard, clawing at her throat, her chest shaking as she tried to breathe. Her eyes were wide with panic.</p><p>The second girl was fighting with the three boys, trying to grab something from their hands. “Give it back! She can’t breathe! Give it to me!”</p><p>Charles took in the scene quickly.</p><p>The girl on the floor wasn’t just panicking, she had asthma. And the boys were holding her inhaler and mocking her—passing it between themselves like a toy. She could die and they are joking with it!. </p><p>The other girl kept lunging for it, but they shoved her back and laughed.</p><p>Charles’ face tightened. “Hey!” he barked. “What are you doing? Give her back her inhaler. Now.”</p><p>The boys stopped and turned to him.</p><p>“Ugh—what’s wrong with that crazy man?” one of them snapped. “It’s none of your business. Go away!”</p><p>Charles stepped forward, anger rising in his voice. “I said give it back.”</p><p>They laughed at him like he was a joke.</p><p>“Let’s go,” one of them said, and with that, they all turned and ran away, the inhaler still in their hand.</p><p>The other girl ran after the boys, shouting, “No! No! Give it back!”</p><p>But they were already gone, they laughed as they vanished down the alley road.</p><p>Charles rushed and dropped to his knees beside the girl on the ground.</p><p>“Hey, hey—stay with me,” he said, steady and firm. “Look at me. Try to breathe steadily. Slow in, slow out.”</p><p>He was about to use the non-inhaler breathing technique, but the second girl rushed back, panic shaking her voice.</p><p>“No! No! It will make it worse. She has Severe Reactive Lung Collapse Syndrome… and Airway Fiber Instability Disorder. She needs her inhaler only. Nothing else works for her.”</p><p>Charles froze. “Where’s the nearest pharmacy?”</p><p>The girl shook her head hard. “No inhaler will work! That one was specialized. Custom-made for her because her lungs react differently. It’s the only thing that can stop her attack.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Charles muttered, staring down at the girl fighting for every breath, her chest jerking, her fingers trembling as she tried to pull in air.</p><p>“How long can she last?” he asked.</p><p>“Maybe… ten minutes,” the girl whispered, voice breaking. “Oh no… we can’t even reach the hospital within that time. What do we do? What do we do—”</p><p>Charles stood up fast. “Stay with her. Call an ambulance now. They might know what to do.”</p><p>The girl nodded quickly and pulled out her phone, her hands shaking.</p><p>“I will bring the inhaler back before then,” Charles said.</p><p>And without another word, he turned and sprinted down the alley after the boys.</p></div>
