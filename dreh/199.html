        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles stood there in surprise. He decided to call her as he dialed her number. He pressed the phone to his ear only to be met with the automated voicemail.</p><p>His brows knitted. That had never happened before. Lizzy&rsquo;s phone was never switched off.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he muttered, trying again, but it also went straight to voicemail.</p><p>He lowered the phone and walked back to the room, scanning everywhere. Just then his eyes noticed a folded white paper partially hidden under the jug on the table.</p><p>Wondering what it could be, he walked over, lifted the jug, and picked up the paper. The moment he unfolded it, he recognized the handwriting. It was obviously Lizzy&rsquo;s.</p><p>[I should have told you this earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have somewhere to be, and I&rsquo;ll be gone for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please don&rsquo;t look for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry for not telling you sooner.]</p><p>Charles frowned.</p><p>That was it. No explanation, no reason, not even where she was going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t make sense to him.</p><p>&ldquo;She could have just texted me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Why write a letter?&rdquo;</p><p>He deduced that the only reason she hadn&rsquo;t called him was because if she had told him, he would have stopped her.</p><p>His jaw clenched. Recently, Lizzy had been distant and always uneasy, as if she were trying to hide something.</p><p>He called her again &mdash; same response.</p><p>With that, Charles knew he had to do something. He had to look for Lizzy.</p><p>His mind went straight to Natasha. Lately, Lizzy had been much closer to her. He pulled out his phone and dialed Natasha&rsquo;s number.</p><p>She picked up on the second ring. &ldquo;Charles? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;Lizzy&rsquo;s gone. She left a note saying she&rsquo;s leaving for a long time and not to look for her. Her phone&rsquo;s off. Do you know anything?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No&hellip; I had no idea. She came by yesterday just to say hi. She was&hellip; strange. Way more friendly than usual.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Charles muttered. &ldquo;More like a goodbye. I think she&rsquo;s headed somewhere dangerous. I have to find her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where could she even be?&rdquo; Natasha asked, her voice softening with worry. &ldquo;I will do my best to locate her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call me the second you find anything,&rdquo; Charles said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; I sure will.&rdquo;</p><p>He hung up without another word and rushed back outside.</p><p>The evening air was already cool and heavy. He slid into the car, started the engine, and sped toward Mr. Noh&rsquo;s place.</p><p>By the time he arrived, it was late.</p><p>He knocked hard on the door. After a long moment, one of the students opened it, squinting at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to see Mr. Noh,&rdquo; Charles demanded.</p><p>The student studied him for a second, then nodded and led him inside, maneuvering past a few curious faces in the hallway until they reached Mr. Noh&rsquo;s study.</p><p>Mr. Noh looked up from his desk, surprise flickering across his face. &ldquo;Huh? What brings you here so late?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Charles said without preamble. &ldquo;Lizzy left. Disappeared. Left me a note saying she will be gone a long time and not to look for her. She didn&rsquo;t say where. Do you know anything? Where could she have gone?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Noh exhaled slowly, setting his pen down. He looked genuinely troubled. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned, stepping closer. &ldquo;You seem closer to her than almost anyone. You even call her your daughter. She would have told you something&hellip; anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Noh leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temple. &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s close to me. But she didn&rsquo;t tell me a thing. Not a word about leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles grew more anxious. She hadn&rsquo;t even told Mr. Noh where she was going.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, thanks,&rdquo; he said, but before he left, he scribbled his number on a scrap of paper and handed it over. &ldquo;Call me if you remember anything&mdash;anything at all.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, he left.</p><p>Now, with nowhere else to turn, only one person might certainly know where she&rsquo;d gone: Godfather.</p><p>According to Lizzy, she had grown up with the Godfather. She also worked for him. So&nbsp; Godfather would definitely know where she was. Who knows&mdash;he might even be the one who gave her this long, dangerous mission.</p><p>Charles called Rain to set up a meeting with Mr. Vincent.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Rain said. &ldquo;He made it clear not to contact him until you finish your missions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, this is urgent. It&rsquo;s about Lizzy&mdash;she&rsquo;s gone, nowhere to be found. She left, and I knew Godfather would know where she went.&rdquo;</p><p>Rain insisted, &ldquo;All the same, Godfather forbade me from taking any requests from you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles was furious. He didn&rsquo;t care about the mission anymore&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose Lizzy.</p><p>He barked back at Rain, &ldquo;You know what? Tell him I&rsquo;m not interested in the mission anymore. I will&nbsp; drop it. Just set up the meeting.&rdquo;</p><p>Rain sounded shocking. &ldquo;What the fuck! You are going to drop it after everything you went through&hellip; just because of a woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lizzy is not just a woman&mdash;she&rsquo;s my woman. Even these missions wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without her. I can&rsquo;t afford to lose her. I will do anything. So tell me&mdash;where is Godfather?&rdquo;</p><p>Rain sighed and swallowed hard. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t just let you throw everything away. Look&hellip; Godfather actually tried to make Lizzy stay after she told him she was leaving. But she insisted. And Godfather can&rsquo;t force her to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned, demanding, &ldquo;She told Godfather she was leaving? Did she tell him where she was going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rain replied. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell him anything. Just that she was leaving. But Godfather couldn&rsquo;t just sit and do nothing, so we traced her. She&rsquo;s currently in Ashtown&hellip; and most surprisingly, with the Hierem clan.&rdquo;</p><p>That only confused Charles more. &ldquo;Ashtown? Who are the Hierem clan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are like the Godfather here in New York, but in Ashtown. They dominate the area. I&rsquo;ve heard how cruel they are&mdash;and they use magic also. They are&nbsp; cultivators.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles froze at the words. &ldquo;So&hellip; what the hell is Lizzy doing there?&rdquo;</p></div>
