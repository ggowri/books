        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charles had always been obsessed with Percy Jackson and the Olympian gods. He loved it so much that he used to sneak out of the orphanage just to watch it at a friend&rsquo;s place. Never in his life had he imagined he would end up in a situation that felt this close to one of those stories.</p><p>Except this wasn&rsquo;t fiction.</p><p>The serpent in front of him was enormous. Three massive heads shared one thick body, scales scraping against the cave floor as it slithered closer.&nbsp;</p><p>Each head moved independently, eyes locked onto him with deadly intent.</p><p>Charles shifted back a step. &ldquo;Aries&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to talk to them,&rdquo; the spirit answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Charles whispered. &ldquo;Tell them I just need the Kyoul Stone. Will they let me take it?&rdquo;</p><p>Aries went silent, clearly communicating with the creature.</p><p>A moment later she spoke. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care about the stone. It&rsquo;s useless to them. But they want you out. Now. They believe your presence is a violation.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles clenched his fists. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Run right now!!!&rdquo; Aries snapped.</p><p>Charles blinked. &ldquo;But I thought you were negotiating&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Run or you die!&rdquo;</p><p>The serpent heads reared back and growled in unison. A deep rumble filled the cave as their throats glowed faintly, heat building from their throats.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Charles muttered.</p><p>If that fire hit him, he would be roasted alive.</p><p>He turned and bolted, sprinting toward the cave entrance. He was already preparing to activate Flash Movement to escape faster&mdash; when the cave entrance suddenly got covered.&nbsp;</p><p>He heard another growl echo from the cave entrance.</p><p>Charles&rsquo;s stomach dropped. That meant something else was blocking the way out.</p><p>He gulped. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; Aries? What do we do?&rdquo;</p><p>No response.</p><p>&ldquo;Aries?&rdquo; he called again. &ldquo;You there?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His pulse spiked.</p><p>Then he turned back.</p><p>The three-headed serpent was already close, its throats glowing brighter, fire swelling at the edge of release. Heat rolled across his skin.</p><p>This is it, he thought.</p><p>Just as the flames were about to burst&mdash;</p><p>Grrrrrrrr.</p><p>A thunderous roar crashed through the cave.</p><p>Something huge rushed in from behind Charles and landed between him and the serpent. Dust exploded upward.</p><p>Charles blinked in shock. It was the giant spider.</p><p>The same one he had spared.</p><p>The spider reared up and shrieked back at the serpent, legs spread wide in a defensive wall. Behind it came the giant lizard, followed by a flood of monsters crowding the cave entrance, growling in unison.</p><p>Charles stared. &ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Aries&rsquo; voice returned calmly. &ldquo;I already notified them to stay close. I predicted something like this might happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Charles breathed. &ldquo;So&hellip; what happens now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The spider will speak for you,&rdquo; Aries said. &ldquo;It will tell them you are harmless. The serpent is only defending the tomb.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles nodded and watched.</p><p>The spider and serpent exchanged a series of guttural growls and hisses. With that, the fire in the serpent&rsquo;s throats dimmed slowly.</p><p>Then, one by one, the three heads lowered. as they backed away.&nbsp;</p><p>Aries said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Go and collect the stone.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles hesitated, watching the serpent carefully.</p><p>Before he could move, the three-headed serpent slowly extended its tail, wrapped it around the glowing diamond, and lifted it from the tomb. With surprising gentleness, it placed the Kyoul Stone right in front of him.</p><p>Charles blinked.</p><p>He slowly reached down and picked it up. The stone was warm in his hand, humming faintly with power. He bowed his head toward the serpent.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p><p>He honestly couldn&rsquo;t believe it. After everything Lizzy had told him about how horrible this realm was, how no man returned alive, how it was a pure nightmare, but the stone had been obtained through negotiation, not slaughter.</p><p>All it took was peace and understanding.</p><p>He turned and walked out of the cave, bowing again to the spider, the giant lizard, and the other monsters gathered outside. A silent gesture of gratitude.</p><p>Aries spoke softly. &ldquo;You have the stone. You can return to your realm now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Charles asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Close your eyes,&rdquo; Aries said and added, &ldquo;Also, be careful who obtains this stone. It is highly dangerous and powerful. Deadly in the wrong hands&rdquo;</p><p>Charles nodded, then hesitated. &ldquo;Uh&hellip;okay&hellip; But before I go&hellip; I want to see you. At least once. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. I&rsquo;m really grateful. Can you show yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like to,&rdquo; Aries said gently. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I might scare you.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surrounded by monsters. How are you going to scare me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t show myself physically,&rdquo; Aries replied. &ldquo;But we will meet again. In your world.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles frowned. &ldquo;My world? How is that pos&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Everything went pitch black.</p><p>****</p><p>Meanwhile in the Hierem clan, blood continued to seep from Charles&rsquo;s body.</p><p>The sight of it made both Lizzy and Natasha panic. Lizzy stood frozen, her face pale and tight with worry, while Natasha completely lost composure.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to die at this rate!&rdquo; Natasha screamed. &ldquo;Please help him!&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Hierem didn&rsquo;t even move. &ldquo;He chose to go,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;Knowing the consequences. It is none of our concern.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy smirked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wasting our time,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He obviously failed. Let&rsquo;s just kill him.&rdquo;</p><p>Several elders nodded in agreement.</p><p>Natasha stared at them in horror. &ldquo;What the fuck? Kill him?&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to Lizzy. &ldquo;Do something! Are you just going to stand there and watch?&rdquo;</p><p>Lizzy&rsquo;s hands trembled. No one could pull a soul back once it was trapped in a realm. There was nothing in any record about saving someone mid-journey. She rubbed her hands together helplessly, her mind racing.</p><p>Jeremy lost patience.</p><p>He pulled a sword from his side and walked toward Charles&rsquo;s motionless body. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not surviving this anyway,&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just suffering. I will end it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Natasha shouted and tried to rush forward, but the guards grabbed her and held her back.</p><p>Jeremy raised the sword.</p><p>Lizzy&rsquo;s eyes hardened. She was about to attack Jerremy. Just then&mdash;-</p><p>Sprrrrrrr.</p><p>A sharp white light burst from Charles&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip; what is that?&rdquo; they whispered.</p><p>Lizzy frowned, staring at the glow. The light grew brighter, humming in the air, forcing everyone to shield their eyes. It shone for several seconds before slowly fading.</p><p>When it vanished, a diamond sat in Charles&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Lord Hierem shot to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that&hellip; the Kyoul Stone?!&rdquo;</p><p>Snap!!!!</p><p>Charles gasped and opened his eyes.</p></div>
