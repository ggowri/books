        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div><p>Charles and Lizzypie arrived home in the quietest way possible. They just entered the room, and Charles sat down quietly. That made Lizzypie psiss off and  scoff.</p><p>“You refused to talk to me because I killed someone? A person who tried to kill us and even bragged he’d keep coming for us? He deserved it!” she said.</p><p>“We are talking about life here! We could have called the police, they would have handled it. You just pulled the trigger and killed someone? That’s awful.” Charles spat.</p><p>That made Lizzypie furious. “You are angry because I killed someone? And you want to be the Godfather? If you really care about this, then forget it because you will have to do this every day.”</p><p>Charles opened his mouth to speak but stayed silent.</p><p>That night, they prepared the elixir—the medicine to treat Mr. Vasilos’ heir. Charles was the one grinding the Nytheris stone together. It was hard and heavy work since it was so hard and needed so much power. Lizzypie cooked the mixture, stirring the herbs until they blended. Then they poured the two together.</p><p>Poff! A faint sound escaped as Lizzypie kept stirring and stirring until every substance melted down. Only a little quantity of the mixed liquid remained. Lizzypie poured it out and rolled it into small, circular forms. Just like that, the Figs of Vigour were made.</p><p>They did all this quietly, barely speaking to each other, and afterward, went their separate ways to sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Charles woke up and walked into the living room to see Lizzypie’s eyes glued to her laptop.</p><p>“What’s that?” he asked.</p><p>“It’s Tracy. Her mother’s trying to convince her to sign Derek’s bullshit deal. If she signs, she will lose the money. It will ruin her,” Lizzypie said.</p><p>Charles tensed up hearing that. “Really? I have to stop her from doing it. Derek’s trying to ruin her.”</p><p>Lizzypie lifted her head. “Yeah, I know. But why would you stop her? How’s that your business?”</p><p>“So, you are suggesting we just watch it happen?” Charles asked.</p><p>“Of course, what are we supposed to do?” she said, folding her arms.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“First, she’s your ex-wife, the one who threw you out and divorced you after cheating on you with Derek. She humiliated you over and over, said you were useless, and saw no future in you. And do you remember the second mission? The Godfather said you should ruin her and make her lose everything , so she would be poor. This is that chance, without you even doing anything. It is common sense not to interfere.” she listed flatly.</p><p>But Charles wasn’t having it. “You know she was the one concerned about us yesterday. She called to warn us about Norman. If not for her call, we would have walked right into the setup. I owe her for that. Ignoring this would be wrong.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded slowly. “We will survive even without your ex-wife. You already have your eyes on her.”</p><p>“At least she still cares,” Charles said.</p><p>Lizzypie shot him a disgusted look. “So? You care for her back now? Are you two still in love? Why are you being such a fool?”</p><p>“It’s not love. It’s just something I have to do. I am not going to sit here and watch her lose everything she built,” Charles said, standing to get dressed.</p><p>Lizzypie’s eyes darkened. “If you really go, I will have no choice but to report you to the Godfather—that you’re not fit to be his successor. I will tell him everything, and he’ll disown you again without thinking twice. You are too weak to be one.”</p><p>“You are going to tell him?”</p><p>“Yeah. You think he sent me here just to help you and sleep with you? No. He sent me to monitor you and give feedback and right now, you are failing,” she said, threatening him.</p><p>Charles stared at her, calm. </p><p>“Do whatever you want.” he said, then left the room.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Tracy’s apartment, inside her room, her eyes were fixed on the paper while her mother kept persuading her.</p><p>“I know it is a lot of money, but it’s a high-return deal. We could make something huge from it. People are already benefiting—it’s legit. Why are you hesitating?” Mrs. Hailey said.</p><p>Tracy gulped. “It’s just… I haven’t heard of this company before, and I’m not sure.”</p><p>Derek chimed in, “I told you, they operate quietly. People like us know them. I’m not here to scam you, Tracy, I’m concerned about you, about your dream to be a big businesswoman like Serena. This is your shot. But if you don’t trust me, fine—I will take the offer to someone who will.”</p><p>He sounded sincere, and it made Tracy feel guilty and bad. She had known Derek since childhood. She believed he wouldn’t hurt her.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey added, “I already did my research. I know the company. I even met some people.” She was lying, of course just trying to convince her, and for Derek’s sake.</p><p>With that, Tracy sighed, smiled faintly, and picked up the pen to sign. Derek grinned, waiting.</p><p>“Ahhhh!”</p><p>A sudden scream came from the living room. It was Francis’s voice—Derek’s son.</p><p>“What happened?” Tracy shouted, dropping the pen and rushing out with the others.</p><p>When they reached the living room, they saw Francis crying loudly and Charles standing beside him.</p><p>Tracy frowned as she folded her arms. “What are you doing here? And what did you do to him?”</p></div>
