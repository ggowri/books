        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div><p>After an awkward goodbye, Charles left Natasha after he told her to call him whenever things got bad, and made his way home to Lizzypie. </p><p>On his way, he couldn’t stop thinking about his sex with Natasha; he could say that was the best sex he had ever had.</p><p>When he reached home, Lizzypie had already prepared dinner.</p><p>“You are back,” she said.</p><p>Charles just stood there smiling, and instantly Lizzypie could see that something about him was strange and somehow off.</p><p>She squinted her eyes and walked towards him. “Mmm, there’s something off about you. Did something happen today?”</p><p>He smiled, spreading his hand. “Guess it.”</p><p>“Uhn, I hate guessing games. Just tell me what happened. You look different.”</p><p>“Well, I moved to Eyes of Satan, level 3 today, called Soul Sight,” he said. He wasn’t even finished before Lizzypie excitedly chimed in.</p><p>“What?! You fucked a virgin?” That was her first question.</p><p>Charles felt shy to even talk; Lizzypie was so much more surprised.</p><p>“Who? Tell me, who did you fuck, mmm?” she nudged him, so curious. Then Charles explained Natasha to her, and she knew her, because Natasha was just another big businesswoman in the city.</p><p>“Wow, I really underestimated you. You really know how to impress women. She is a big and beautiful woman and she allowed you to fuck and deflower her—that was fucking awesome!” she said.</p><p>Charles puffed out his chest in pride. Then she asked him what the power of level 3 was.</p><p>“Soul Sight. Looking at you and activating it, I can see what you will do in the next 5 seconds,” he said.</p><p>The power was so great that Lizzypie couldn’t believe it. She scoffed it off and said, “Even Godfather doesn’t have that kind of power. Are you sure you know what you’re saying?”</p><p>“You know what? I want you to attack me, and I will predict all your moves and what you will do—without even stressing,” he said.</p><p>Lizzypie scoffed. “You really overestimate yourself. You know I’m much faster than you. If I go in full capacity, I will destroy you.”</p><p>“Yes, I want you to go all in, and I will easily weave through all your moves within the next five seconds.”</p><p>Lizzypie’s eyes narrowed, a wicked grin splitting her face. “Fine. No holding back.” She cracked her knuckles.</p><p>Charles just stood there.</p><p>[Soul Sight Activated!].</p><p>She exploded forward.</p><p>She threw a left jab, like a viper’s strike aimed straight for his throat. Charles tilted his head an inch, easily weaving it</p><p>Right roundhouse kick, lightning-fast, heel carving toward his ribs. He stepped inside the arc, the kick slicing empty air where his torso had been a blink ago.</p><p>She spun low, sweeping his legs. Charles hopped lazily landing exactly where her leg was.</p><p>Lizzypie tried every move, but he weaved them all.</p><p>“Too slow,” he teased. Lizzypie even picked up a plate and threw it at him, which he dodged effortlessly.</p><p>Just then, at the last second, Lizzypie elbow nearly hit him in his face, but he weaved it and then shouted.</p><p>“It&#x27;s over. The 5 seconds I could see is over”, he immediately said.</p><p>Lizzypie smiled and nodded at the new found power.</p><p>“Wow, that’s great… It&#x27;s really impressive. Godfather will be so amazed by this power” Lizzypie said, shaking him.</p><p>Just then, the dashboard opened in front of him.</p><p>{Soul Sight exhausted!}</p><p>With that, everything went dizzy and he fainted. He didn’t wake up until the next morning. He groaned, holding his head, and Lizzypie was right beside him.</p><p>“What happened to me?” he demanded.</p><p>“You should know. You overused your new power when you’re still at low capacity. You will have to upgrade the level to its maximum before you can use it,” Lizzypie told him. Charles traced it back to what the dashboard had warned him about. He held his head, still in pain.</p><p>“I advise you not to use it until you upgrade it, because fainting like this in public will only embarrass you—or worse, if you use it in a fight, it will put you in danger. So please don’t use it for now,” she advised him.</p><p>Charles nodded, then inquired, “So, just like the other time, I have to look for a sapphire or ruby gemstone, absorb its energy before I can start using it?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded. “Sure.”</p><p>Then he immediately thought about Natasha. He would have to go back to her store and look for another worthy stone. He couldn’t wait for him to use this new power to his capacity and freely without any consequences.</p><p>×××××</p><p>Meanwhile, in Tracy’s room, Derek and Mrs. Hailey were sweating and heaving hard after they had just fucked each other.</p><p>After a moment, Mrs. Hailey said, “I can’t believe that bastard, always acting pure and innocent, would cheat on Ms. Serena. He is a dog! How could you be that cruel? I hate men like that.”</p><p>Derek faced her. “Does that mean you hate me? I’m dating your daughter, and also cheating on her by fucking you.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey scoffed it off. “That is different!” Even though that was the most hypocritical, they were so shameless, and though they knew they were doing something bad, they wouldn’t admit it.</p><p>Derek grinned. “I now have something I can use to destroy him. I will make sure this makes it to the public. He will lose every respect he scammed people to gain.” He put on a devilish grin.</p><p>“Yes, do that… I want to see him crumble,” Mrs. Hailey even added.</p><p>Just then a voice shrilled, “Mom!”</p><p>That was Tracy, and the voice was so near—she was coming to the room.</p><p>Derek and Mrs. Hailey froze, still naked, shocked as they stared at each other.</p></div>
