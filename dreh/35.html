        <div>"How does that concern you? Did Tracy tell you this?" Charles answered coldly.<br/>"Oh, I think that’s right. You don’t even deny it," Derek said.<br/>"Why should I deny it? I don’t think I should be bothered by what someone like you says."<br/>Derek wanted to ridicule Charles at all costs. "Don’t be deceived by him. He is an unambitious person who sucks up to rich people. I am sure you got engaged to him because of the saving incident. But it was just all a setup!"<br/>Charles glared at him while Derek smiled, thinking he was successful.<br/>"Really? Then I think that is a good thing if that’s true," Serena answered. Tracy raised her eyebrows at the response.<br/>"He won’t do anything good for you. He is just bad luck, and I am sure he only wants to con you. You deserve better than this lowlife man," Derek ranted.<br/>"You shouldn’t—" Fred tried to shut him up, but Serena held him back; she wanted to embarrass Derek and make him feel crazed.<br/>"Why should I care, as long as I want him? I don’t care if he was a lowlife or if that event was set up," she said.<br/>Derek frowned, his expression darkening. "You want him? Someone as lowly as him?"<br/>"As long as he is handsome and perfect for me," she said, moving closer to Charles.<br/>Charles scoffed.<br/>"He just wants to take advantage of your beauty and dump you, just as he did with his ex-wife here."<br/>"Who cares? That’s what I’m telling you—I want him. It doesn’t concern me if he wants to take advantage of me. If that’s his mission, then I’ll be happy!" Serena laughed.<br/>Derek frowned at her response, and so did Tracy.<br/>Fred chuckled at his boss’s sudden behavior. She was always cold—why this cringe behavior?<br/>"So, I think it’s none of your concern what his mission is," Serena said, holding Charles tighter.<br/>Derek got very angry. How could she be so stubborn? How could she decide to stay with a guy she believed wanted to con her?<br/>"So, because he is handsome to you, you want to allow him to swindle you?"<br/>"Why are you so repetitive? It’s none of your concern who I hang out with. I don’t even know you, yet you are being rude… I think the lowlife here is you. Also, remember—we are collaborating with you, and we can cut it anytime we want," Serena snapped.<br/>Derek fumed. "Rude? Just because I’m advising you?"<br/>"I don’t want your advice, please. And please allow this handsome man to con me," she said, now leaning even closer to Charles.<br/>"You filthy bitch!" Derek barked in anger. Fred wanted to interfere, unable to keep up with Derek’s arrogance, but Serena motioned him to stop.<br/>"I don’t know why you’re angry just because I don’t listen to you, but with what you just did, consider our partnership done," Serena said with a smile.<br/>Serena scoffed—she had achieved what she planned.<br/>Tracy, boiling in rage where she stood, her eyes bloody, believed Charles had known Serena for a long time, and that they were together even while she and Charles were still married.<br/>"I didn’t know you were such a jerk. I misjudged you. I did the right thing divorcing you," Tracy spat.<br/>Serena decided to provoke her also. "Thank you so much for divorcing him. If not, how could I have the opportunity to be with this handsome man?"<br/>Tracy glared at them. "I’m stupid for blaming myself and feeling guilty, when you were just having fun with another woman before we even officially broke up, and you pinned it on me because of a misunderstanding. Just a little talk, we could have settled everything."<br/>"You initiated the divorce first, and I signed it. That makes it official. If you had anything to explain, you should have told me before the divorce," Charles said. But he was also curious about what Tracy had insisted on telling him.<br/>"You are such a jerk. This will be our last conversation," Tracy said.<br/>"Okay, let it be that," Charles accepted, though it pained him, and he felt something sting in his heart.<br/>Tracy then decided to use Derek to ridicule Charles, just as Serena had done.<br/>"You’re only breathing because of me. You sucked on me like a parasite. I clothed you, fed you, even gave you shelter. But you chose to bite me instead—ungrateful dog!" Tracy shrieked.<br/>"I think you made it clear just now that there won’t be any more conversation between the two of you. He is mine now," Serena said.<br/>"What does that concern you, lady? You’re just a lowlife like him since you’re sucking up to him," Tracy spat.<br/>"If you are done, please step aside. Let’s leave," Charles said.<br/>Tracy then said, "Since you seem to have finally moved on, I will move on also and officially be with Derek, just as you misunderstood!"<br/>Charles squeezed her face. Tracy was really stuck on this misunderstanding thing, even when she really did cheat. He also felt like telling her about Derek and her mother’s awful relationship, but she didn’t seem to be in her right mind right now. He again postponed it.</div>
