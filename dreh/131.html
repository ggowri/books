        <div>Wilson and Norman roared at the same time, voices cracking.<br/>“FATHER! Why are you bowing to him?”<br/>“Father, get up! Are you mistaking him for someone else?”<br/>But Mr. Eden and Mr. Jason didn’t lift their heads.<br/>They bowed even lower.<br/>Mr. Eden said, “Please… our sons are gullible and reckless. They don’t understand anything. Forgive them, Mr. Charles. We will compensate you for every damage done. Just… spare us.”<br/>Mr. Jason repeated, “Please forgive them, Mr. Charles.”<br/>Norman’s face twisted in disbelief. “Father… why are you doing this? This is CHARLES! He’s nothing. A low-life! He broke my hand! Why are you bowing to someone like him?”<br/>Wilson stumbled forward. “Father… are you pranking us? Stand up. Stop embarrassing us. This is ridiculous!”<br/>Their fathers didn’t move.<br/>Then Mr. Eden snapped his head up and roared:<br/>“YOU BOTH SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW!”<br/>The entire lobby shook from his voice.<br/>“Get down on your knees,” he ordered, veins visible on his neck. “Kneel. And apologize to Mr. Charles. Right now.”<br/>Norman froze.<br/>Wilson’s eyes widened. “Father… I’m not kneeling for this nobody. This doesn’t make sense—”<br/>But they had no idea.<br/>Before coming here, Charles had used his final emergency request from the Godfather.<br/>He asked the Godfather to notify Mr. Eden and Mr. Jason who he truly was.<br/>They were instructed not to mention Charles’s true identity out loud.<br/>Just to acknowledge … and obey him.<br/>The moment they got the message, they rushed here before their sons could do something stupid.<br/>And now they were kneeling for survival.<br/>Mr. Jason looked at Norman, face red with rage. “If you refuse to kneel right now, I am disowning you on the spot. Don’t test me.”<br/>Norman shook his head, trembling. “Father please, what are you saying—”<br/>Mr. Eden turned to Wilson, voice low and murderous. “Wilson… I swear, if you don’t kneel to Mr. Charles this second, I will put a bullet in your leg myself and throw you out of this family.”<br/>Wilson stepped back. “Father… what—what are you talking about…”<br/>Mr. Eden marched toward them with the fury of a man who had swallowed humiliation for years. Before Wilson or Norman could react, he slapped both of them hard.<br/>Smack!<br/>Smack!<br/>The sound echoed through the lobby.<br/>“Do NOT question us!” he barked. “Do it. Now!”<br/>Wilson and Norman froze.<br/>Their fathers had never hit them in public before.<br/>But Mr. Eden’s face was twisted with pure rage. Even the guards stepped back.<br/>Norman whispered under his breath, “Charles must have gotten to our fathers… he must know one of their darkest secrets… he must be using it against them.”<br/>Wilson nodded quickly. “That’s the only explanation. There’s no other reason they would bow to him.”<br/>They were both shaking now — but they knew better than to argue. Humiliation burned through them as they slowly sank to their knees.<br/>Charles watched quietly, not blinking.<br/>Wilson and Norman never imagined there would be a day they would kneel for this man.<br/>They thought he was bluffing when he said it before.<br/>But here they were.<br/>Broken pride.<br/>Shaking hands.<br/>Knees on the cold floor.<br/>Surrounded by their own men watching them fall.<br/>Mr. Eden shouted, “Now apologize to him! Loudly! Apologize for your stupidity!”<br/>Wilson felt his stomach twist. Norman wanted to disappear into the floor. Their faces were red, their bodies trembling with humiliation.<br/>Mr. Jason snapped, “Now!”<br/>Both men panicked and shouted at the same time:<br/>“W-We’re sorry!”<br/>“We apologize for our stupidity!”<br/>“Please forgive us, Mr. Charles!”<br/>Their voices cracked, Everyone stared, and stunned.<br/>The great Titan Heir and the Real Consortium Heir were kneeling and begging like schoolchildren.<br/>Mr. Eden bowed again and said, “Please… we will punish them accordingly. Please spare us.”<br/>Charles didn’t waste time. “I’m not here for drama or a show. I’m here for the money he owed. The damages he caused.”<br/>Both fathers nodded immediately.<br/>“Oh—yes, yes, of course,” Mr. Eden said quickly. “If that is all, please follow us. This way.”<br/>Their politeness shocked everyone.<br/>Even the sixty gunmen behind them exchanged confused looks.<br/>The men who were ready to kill Charles minutes ago now parted to let him pass like he was royalty. <br/> Wilson and Norman were still on their knees. After their father's has gone upstairs,<br/>they slowly stood, their faces burning with humiliation.<br/>Wilson clenched his fists. “I swear… I will kill Charles myself. He definitely has something on our fathers. That’s the only reason they bowed.”<br/>Norman nodded. “Yeah. He thinks he’s cool now. Our fathers are just pretending. They want to play smart with him. They’ll get him later. Watch.”<br/>They had no idea how wrong they were.<br/>---<br/>Upstairs, in the executive room<br/>Mr. Eden and Mr. Jason acted like servants.<br/>They gathered cash, even opened several safe vaults. In the end, they prepared a total of 10 million dollars and placed it on the table.<br/>Mr. Eden’s hands trembled slightly. “Mr. Charles… is this enough? If not, we can add more. We can double it.”<br/>Charles checked the amount and nodded. “It’s enough.”<br/>Both men exhaled in relief.<br/>Charles added, his voice cold, “Now warn your sons. If they cross me or my loved ones one more time… I won’t spare them.”<br/>“Yes, yes, we understand,” Mr. Jason said instantly. “We understand… Godfather.”<br/>Charles frowned. “I’m not the Godfather.”<br/>Mr. Eden swallowed hard. “No… but you are his grandson. That alone means you are a Godfather by blood.”<br/>Both men lowered their heads again.</div>
