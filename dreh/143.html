        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div>Charles didn’t waste a second. He pulled Lizzypie closer by her hips and pressed his mouth against her.<br/> She was already wet, warm, and sweet on his tongue. He started slowly, licking up and down her slit, tasting every drop. Lizzypie let out a soft moan and threaded her fingers into his hair, pulling him closer.<br/>He circled her clit with the tip of his tongue, gentle at first, then harder when she started rocking against his face.<br/> Her thighs trembled. He sucked her clit into his mouth, flicking it fast, then slow, then fast again. Her breathing turned into little gasps.<br/>“Charles… yes… right there…”<br/>He slid one finger inside her, then two, curling them just the way she liked. She was so tight and hot around his fingers. <br/>He kept licking, kept sucking, kept pumping his fingers until her legs shook hard and she cried out. Her whole body tensed, then she came, flooding his mouth with her sweetness. He didn’t stop until she pushed his head away, panting and laughing softly.<br/>Charles stood up, his heart pounding. His cock was already hard and aching in his pants. He reached for his belt, ready to pull it off and slide inside her while she was still trembling from her orgasm.<br/>But Lizzypie caught his wrist.<br/>“No,” she said softly, eyes half-lidded. “Not that.”<br/>Charles froze, confused. “But… you are soaked. I thought—”<br/>She shook her head and dropped to her knees in front of him instead. She pulled his pants and boxers down together, and his cock sprang out, thick and hard, already leaking at the tip.<br/>Lizzypie looked up at him, then took him into her mouth without another word.<br/>Charles groaned loud. Her mouth was hot and wet, lips tight around him. She took him deep, deeper than usual, until he felt the back of her throat. <br/>She pulled back slowly, tongue swirling around the head.<br/>Even though Charles should be enjoying the moment,  But he was drowned with thoughts. <br/>Lately, Lizzypie had been doing this a lot; asking him to eat her, letting him make her cum with his mouth, but never letting him inside her.<br/> At first he thought she just thought she was just setting boundaries. But this was the second or third  time. <br/>He could feel something was wrong.  But right now, with her lips sliding up and down his cock, sucking hard.<br/>“Lizzy… fuck… ”<br/>She hummed around him, the vibration pushing him over the edge. He grabbed her hair gently, hips jerking as he immediately pulled out from her mouth and cum.<br/>After they finished, she finally let go, she licked her lips and stood up, naked and calm, like nothing big just happened.<br/>“Go shower,” she said. “We leave for Winchester tomorrow morning.”<br/>And just like that, she walked into her room. Charles sighed and decided to make some investigation about what was happening with her.<br/>××××<br/>The next morning. <br/>Charles and Lizzypie stood outside the hotel with their small bags to make their way to Winchester. <br/>They were one step from getting into the car when tires screamed.<br/>Skrrrrr<br/>A silver Mercedes shot across the driveway and stopped hard, blocking their car. The door flew open and Tracy stormed out. Her face was red with fury.<br/>Charles frowned, wondering what happened. “Tracy? What the—”<br/>SMACK!<br/>The slap was so loud it echoed off the hotel walls. Lizzypie’s head snapped to the side. She stumbled back one step, hand on her cheek, eyes wide in shock. Tracy just slapped her.<br/>Charles lunged forward. “What the fuck?! Why did you hit her?”<br/>Tracy pointed a shaking finger at Lizzypie. Her voice was raw with anger.<br/>“I shouldn’t have just slapped her. I should have killed her.”  <br/>She turned to Charles. “She is the one who destroyed me. She is the reason I lost everything!”<br/>Charles’s mouth went dry. “What are you talking about?”<br/>Tracy laughed, but it was an ugly sound. “I got the CCTV footage yesterday. Your little bitch here,” she spat the word, “snuck into my company’s security room two weeks ago. She copied every file about tax evasion, illegal activities my company was involved in. Then she uploaded it all online herself. She even hacked into my servers!.”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed.<br/>Tracy stepped closer, tears of rage in her eyes. “You are laughing?. You think this is funny?. Bitch!.”<br/>Charles sighed. He knew every word Lizzypie said was true.  Because he remembered that night. Lizzypie did this to help him finish the mission Godfather gave him. <br/>Charles stepped between them before Lizzypie could actually swing. “Enough. Tracy, calm down.”<br/>Tracy’s jaw dropped. “Calm down? I nearly became poor because of her. Why would she do that to me?”<br/>Lizzypie folded her arms. “Everything I published, you really did it. I helped the official catch a criminal.”<br/>Tracy stared at her like she was losing her mind. “A criminal?.  Because of tax evasion?.  Tell me one company that isn’t involved in some illegal activity. Just one. And even if I was, why would you expose me? What did I ever do to you?”<br/>Lizzypie shrugged slowly, eyes cold. “You can say it’s because I hate you.”<br/>Tracy froze. “You… hate me? Enough to ruin me?”<br/>Lizzypie didn’t blink. “Yes.”<br/>Tracy swung to Charles, pointing at Lizzypie like she’d found proof of pure evil. “Because of Charles, right? You wanted him beside you forever. You were jealous and scared Charles would return to me if I'm rich, that's the reason you want to ruin me!. .”<br/>She moved closer to Charles. “This is what I’m talking about. She’s horrible. You heard her. Let’s go, Charles. Before she does something  bad to you too”<br/>She turned, expecting him behind her.<br/>But Charles didn’t move.<br/>Tracy stopped, looked back, and her voice cracked. “Charles? What are you waiting for? Don’t tell me you want to stay with this woman after what you just heard.”<br/>Charles exhaled slowly. “I will stay with her.”<br/>Tracy’s mouth fell open. “Charles? What? You will stay after hearing this?”.<br/>Charles didn't say anything. <br/>“Wait—don’t tell me you knew about this. You knew this bitch tried to ruin me?”<br/>Lizzypie stepped forward, eyes sharp. “Hey. Call me bitch again, and I will return that slap with interest.”</div>
