        <h1>Chapter 28.</h1>
        <div>“What are you waiting for? Mr. Moretti, just send this man out now,” Mr. Vasilios, the investor, barked impatiently.<br/>Mr. Moretti sighed, still unsure of what to say. Most of all, he didn’t want to offend Mr. Vasilios. And Vasilios seemed fond of Derek. Probably because Derek mirrored him perfectly: an arrogant man.<br/>Just then, Charles spoke up. “There’s a high-tech detector machine that can test if jewelry is fake or not. It’s 100% accurate. Why don’t we use that?”<br/>Mr. Moretti saw this as his way out. With the entire party pressing on him, this was the best solution. He wouldn’t have to offend the guests, and he could preserve the family’s reputation.<br/>At the same time, he wouldn’t appear ungrateful to Charles. For once, he began to see Charles as useful, even admirable. Charles had just offered a way to calm the storm.<br/>“Oh, yes… we will send it to the appraisal center,” Mr. Moretti declared. “Tomorrow, you will all be informed whether it’s fake or not. The authorities will handle it from there.”<br/>Since Derek was eager to end things before he actually had to bark like a dog, who knew if the ring was real or not?, what if Charles had stolen it!”.<br/>Charles decided to let it go for now.<br/>Everyone seemed satisfied, until a voice cut through the crowd.<br/>“What’s going on here with all this commotion?”<br/>It was Tracy, walking toward them in a sleek black gown, looking striking. After Serena, Tracy was considered the second beauty of the city.<br/>Tracy was also well known as the only woman who had built her wealth alone, running her own company. <br/>But, no one knew she had achieved everything with Charles’s intelligence.<br/>Her eyes narrowed as she spotted Charles. “What the heck is he doing here?” she frowned. Then her gaze caught the diamond ring in his hand, sparkling under the light.<br/>“What! That’s mine. That’s my ring! What is it doing in your hand?” she screamed.<br/>The brilliance of the ring made it clear in her mind: Charles could never afford something like that. He must have stolen it from her.<br/>Tracy had a sharp eye for jewelry, she owned a jewelry store aside from her company.<br/>Charles answered calmly, “Really, this is yours? Funny. Someone here just said it was fake.”<br/>“Whoever said that is blind and has a low IQ! This is original. You can tell just by how it dazzles. What’s something like this doing in your hand?!”<br/>Gotcha.<br/>Charles smiled. The moment Tracy said that, Derek’s face twisted with annoyance. The crowd began to grumble, their suspicions turning.<br/>Tracy glanced around, realizing the atmosphere had shifted. <br/>Did I say something wrong? she wondered.<br/>Just then, Mrs. Hailey, her mother, snapped. “What are you saying? That ring is fake.”<br/>“Fake? No way.” Tracy leaned closer, and even collected the ring from him. examining it again. “This is original. Wait… this is an eight-carat diamond, and it’s authentic! You should hold this man down!. he definitely stole it!”<br/>Tracy thought she was humiliating Charles by accusing him of theft. She didn’t realize she had just helped him instead.<br/>Charles smirked. “Tracy here owns a jewelry store. If anyone knows whether it’s fake or not, it’s her.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey quickly cut in. “It’s fake, Tracy. A clever fake. Derek said it’s fake, and even Mr. Vasilios agrees it’s fake!”<br/>That was when Tracy realized she had messed up. Everyone was glaring at her now.<br/>Derek quickly jumped in. “Mr. Moretti already said he will send it to the appraisal center. Until then, no one can conclude.”<br/>Tracy bit her lip, backtracking fast. She couldn’t insist it was stolen anymore. So she changed her words.<br/>“Also… I can’t say for sure if it’s fake or not. Because this isn’t mine, it just looks similar. Let’s just wait for Mr. Moretti to give us the result.”<br/>Charles suddenly stepped toward Tracy, his eyes dark, and his expression was cold enough to send a chill through her spine.<br/>“You accused me of theft,” he said, voice low and dangerous, “without even a moment’s hesitation, even when you’re not even sure. You outright accused me of theft.”<br/>Charles’s voice was calm, and he looked so deeply disappointed. Tracy’s breath hitched as Charles stepped even closer.<br/>“You… you, what do you think you’re doing?”<br/>Now she could feel his breath against her skin. She stared up at his handsome features. He had never looked at her like this—so severe, so dismissive. He had always behaved like her loyal dog. Tracy knew she should be furious at his defiance… and yet, she found him irresistibly sexy.<br/>Her lips trembled. What’s his deal? she wondered.Is he going to slap me?Or… kiss me?<br/>Both thoughts sent an unexpected heat rushing through her, her breathing growing shallow. She shut her eyes. <br/>She was one of the city’s beauties, and she believed Charles was definitely trying to mess with her to score some points.<br/>She waited for the kiss. If he dared to do it here, in front of everyone… Tracy had already decided she would take him back. Or, deep down, she kind of hoped Charles would... spank her.<br/>But instead of touching her, Charles plucked the ring from her hand with swift precision, not even granting her a second glance.<br/>“You are a pathetic liar,” he sneered at her.<br/>Humiliation flooded her. In front of everyone, Tracy’s lips still held that awkward pose, waiting for a kiss. She lowered her eyes, her cheeks burning in shame. She had never felt so embarrassed in her life!<br/>Finally, Charles turned from her and faced Mr. Moretti. He bowed slightly. “Sorry for the commotion.”<br/>Mr. Moretti just smiled, his eyes narrowing with a glint of approval. He was impressed by Charles. The man had handled the mess cleanly. He did what Derek could never do, take care of the trouble without dragging the Moretti family down.<br/>If not for Mr. Vasilios sitting there, Moretti would have already ordered Derek to be beaten and thrown out. But now, he simply let the scene play out.<br/>Charles then turned, walked straight to Serena, and handed her the box. His tone is calm.<br/>“Happy birthday. Please take your gift.”<br/>Serena gently took it from him, her fingers brushing the box. And she scoffed.<br/>Charles bowed slightly. “I will be going. I don’t want to discomfort anyone or spoil the party any more than I already have. Have fun.”<br/>With that, he turned and walked away.<br/>Mr. Moretti’s eyes followed him until he disappeared. Quiet, sharp. He had just witnessed something different in Charles.</div>
