        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div>Lizzypie stepped in, her voice sharp with anger. “You know, you shouldn’t always throw the word bitch around like it’s nothing.”<br/>Tracy rolled her eyes. “What? You all gonna gang up on me and beat me now? I repeat…bitch.”<br/>Natasha  stepped forward, fully ready to teach Tracy a lesson, but Charles cut in.<br/>“Enough,” he said, raising a hand.<br/>Serena snapped, boiling with anger, “She just called me a bitch!”<br/>“And you want to fight her outside the courthouse, in front of everyone?” Charles asked. “Calm down.”<br/>Serena clenched her jaw but stepped back. Charles looked at the three of them. “Can you all leave please. I want to talk to her alone.”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed loudly and glared at Tracy like she was something stuck under a shoe. But she, Natasha , and Serena walked off.<br/>The moment they were gone, Tracy smiled at Charles like nothing had happened.<br/>“Good thing you cleared your name,” she said. “You even turned the media around. Everyone’s calling you a hero after you saved them from that menace Wilson.”<br/>Charles shook his head. “Yeah. But I don’t think you have the right to say any of that. You didn’t even check on me once. Not even a single visit. And even today—you only show up after the trial is already over.”<br/>Tracy swallowed. “I… I just got my feet back. I really believed you were innocent, Charles. And even if you did kill him, I wouldn’t judge you. He deserved it. But you know how it is… I didn’t want to get involved in any scandal. Not after I just rose again.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “Good for you. You choose that path and you should stick to it. And also, stop throwing the word bitch at people. I won’t hold them back next time.”<br/>Tracy sneered a little. “So you think they’ll hit me? They won’t dare.”<br/>Charles sighed. “Just stop it. I’m leaving.”<br/>He turned to walk away, but Tracy yelled after him.<br/>“Charles!”<br/>He stopped but didn’t look back.<br/>“I know you are happy, and feeling almighty because all these women are following you around,” she said. “But don’t you ever think, just once—that they’re using you?”<br/>Charles exhaled hard. “I don’t want this conversation again.”<br/>“No, you have to hear it,” Tracy insisted. “They are three women, Charles. Three. And they’re all big. CEOs and beautiful,  Why do you think they are chasing you? It’s not money—because you don’t have it. So what else? I’m sure it’s your masculine sex activity. They are using you as a sex object! And using your smart brain on top of it. You need to wake up!”<br/>Charles turned around slowly, irritation burning in his eyes.<br/>“Shut up, Tracy,” he said. “At least they stick with me, even if I’m giving them sex and my smart brain. I gave all that to you too. You didn’t appreciate it. You even started avoiding sex because of that Buddha stuff. And what did I get in return? Divorce.”<br/>“It was all a misunderstanding! We cleared that Charles ” Tracy said quickly. “Charles, you are free to come back now. We can fix it—”<br/>“No,” Charles cut in sharply. “I won’t entertain this conversation. Enjoy your new wealth alone.”<br/>He turned and walked away for good.<br/>Tracy stood still, stung and silent, watching him disappear down the street, realizing there was nothing she could do to get him back.<br/>Charles walked away from Tracy without looking back. When he reached the parking area, he only saw Serena standing there.<br/>He frowned. “Where are the others?”<br/>“They have all left already,” Serena said. “But you and I have to go meet my father. He wants to apologize.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “It isn’t necessary.”<br/>“It is,” she insisted. “I was removed from the company because of this. They kicked me out of the house too. Everyone believed you did it. They even held an official conference to distance themselves from you. And now that the table has turned, the public will drag them if they don’t fix it fast.”<br/>Charles exhaled and nodded once. “Oh… okay then.”<br/>They entered the car and drove off.<br/>For a while, silence hung between them. Then Charles spoke.<br/>“Uhm… about our relationship…”<br/>Serena cut him off immediately. “Oh, don’t worry. Just stay with me for two more weeks. I’m sure Father will make me CEO by then.  We can break up then.”<br/>Charles nodded slowly, even though that wasn’t what he wanted to ask at all.<br/>They reached the estate moments later. When they entered the grand room, the entire family was already gathered.<br/>The moment Charles stepped inside, Mr. Moretti stood up with exaggerated warmth.<br/>“Ohh! My son-in-law is here!” he said, greeting him with delight and politeness.<br/>Meanwhile, Collins sat stiffly in his chair, his jaw locked, fuming like he could explode any second.<br/>Charles didn’t even get the chance to fully settle before Mr. Moretti gestured eagerly.<br/>“Sit here, sit here—closer to me,” he said, patting the seat right beside him like Charles indicating he was the most valuable man in the building.<br/>Charles sat. Collins’ nostrils flared with fire. <br/>Mr. Moretti cleared his throat. “You know… we all really owe you our big sincere apology.”<br/>The room fell quiet.<br/>He continued, “We know it won’t erase what we did. We truly believed you were guilty. And we even made Serena suffer because she defended you.”<br/>Charles smiled politely and nodded. “It’s fine. You did what you felt was right at the time.”<br/>“No, no,” Mr. Moretti insisted. “Today, you turned everything around. The media is praising you nonstop. And wow—” he chuckled, “I can see why my daughter is mad over you.”<br/>Charles chuckled softly. “It’s nothing. I just handled what needed to be handled. And you also did what you have to do”<br/>Mr. Moretti shook his head. “Wow, you are slick and smart. Look, I’ve seen enough to know this—you are more than capable for my daughter.”<br/>Charles stiffened slightly.<br/>Then Mr. Moretti lifted his shoulders proudly.<br/>“I have decided,” he said dramatically, “that you both will be having your wedding in two weeks!”<br/>The entire room froze.<br/>Even Serena’s head snapped toward him. “What?”<br/>Mr. Moretti continued without slowing down, smiling wide.<br/>“And during the wedding party, I will officially announce my step down. Serena will become the CEO and the head of the family. And you…her husband, will become the COO and her closest assistant.”<br/>Everyone gasped.</div>
