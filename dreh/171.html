        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div>Everyone went silent first. The shock landed before the fear of their mouths hanging open. No one breathed.<br/>Just then, they panickingly exploded.<br/>Shouts broke out as the men stumbled, staring at Jasmine’s body as it collapsed fully to the ground.<br/>The voice from the helicopter thundered again, colder now.<br/>“If you don’t want to end up like him, drop your weapons. Right now.”<br/>Metal clattered everywhere. Pistols. Rifles. Magazines hitting dirt. The guards flanking the wealthy men were the first to surrender. <br/>They knew the angles of the helicopters and the red all over them. There was nowhere to run.<br/>The powerful men looked furious and humiliated. Their hands shook as they raised them.<br/>The Minister of Internal Affairs stepped forward again, his face burning with rage.<br/>“You are making a terrible mistake,” he shouted. “I swear to you, there will be consequences. You will not escape this.”<br/>Charles turned slowly toward him. His expression was calm.<br/>“I’ll be waiting,” he said. “Now if you don’t want to get roasted and end up like Jasmine, each of you will enter your car and leave”<br/>The minister clenched his jaw in anger before turning to leave. <br/>One by one they turned. Luxury cars rolled away under the watchful shadows of the helicopters.<br/>The helicopters stayed hovering. The girls were being untied now. Some collapsed to their knees while others clung to each other and cried.<br/>Charles turned back to the Only two men remaining. Mr. Damien’s men.<br/>They were shaking badly. Sweat poured down their faces. One of them dropped to his knees without being told.<br/>“Please,” he begged. “We were just following orders. Don't  kill us”<br/>Charles looked down at them, his voice low and steady.<br/>“I won’t kill you,” he said, “if you tell me the truth. I’ve heard Damien has a secret house, somewhere he stores drugs, gold, everything that makes up his real wealth.”<br/>The two men stiffened.<br/>They have been researching him for a while. For one of the richest men in this city, his official accounts are laughably small. Too small. <br/>That’s how They knew he was dodging taxes and hiding money he could never explain. He doesn’t trust banks, not even offshore ones. Instead, he moves everything by truck, every weekend, straight to a warehouse. If they get their hands on that place and hijack it, that’s the end of Damien.”<br/>The two men looked at each other, fear flashing between them.<br/>One of them shook his head. “Mr. Damien will kill us if we tell you.”<br/>Charles didn’t reply. He bent, picked up a gun from the ground, raised it, and fired straight at him.<br/>Boom.<br/>The man dropped instantly.<br/>The second man went pale, his knees almost giving way as he nodded frantically. “Yeah… yeah. I know the house. I will tell you.”<br/>“Good,” Charles said calmly.<br/>“But,” the man rushed on, “The place is guarded by Razor himself. That Asian assassin. He can kill with his eyes closed.”<br/>Charles swallowed. He knew exactly who he meant. The assassin from the other day.  He sighed, maybe this was the time to face him again.<br/>Charles’s eyes stayed on the trembling man.<br/>“You will take me to the warehouse,” he said.<br/>The man nodded fast.<br/>Before he could speak again, Lizzypie stepped closer to Charles. Her voice dropped. “The assassin is there. Are you really going to face him?”<br/>She searched his face. “He nearly beat you to death last time.”<br/>Charles scoffed softly. “You think I would back down?” His jaw tightened. “I was humiliated. I have to face him again.”<br/>Lizzypie swallowed. “Even with your upgrades… Do you think it’s enough? He is so fast”<br/>“It’s enough,  I will face him again,” Charles said without hesitation.<br/>She studied him for a long second, then nodded, though worry still clung to her eyes. She knew there was no stopping him.<br/>She turned toward Vera, who was still frozen, arms wrapped around herself.<br/>“It’s okay now,” Lizzypie said gently. “Tina and Amara sent us.”<br/>Vera’s eyes widened. Fear gave way to shock, then joy. “Really? Where are they?”<br/>“We will take you to them,” Lizzypie said.<br/>She turned to the other girls and raised her voice. “You can all go home now. You’re safe.”<br/>Relief broke loose like a flood. Some laughed through tears. Others hugged each other tightly before scattering in different directions, disappearing into the night. None of them called the police. They knew that Damien owned too many of them.<br/>The helicopters slowly ascended, Reaper and Zander stepped out. The leaders of the Spider Gang.<br/>Charles had once used Rain to discipline them. So they knew exactly who he was—and who he was connected to. They bowed deeply.<br/>“Boss.”<br/>Charles pointed at the remaining man. “Take him. He’s leading us to our next target.”<br/>“Yes, boss,” they said together.<br/>Charles turned to Lizzypie. “Take Vera home. I will meet you soon.”<br/>Lizzypie’s brows drew together. “Are you really going without me?”<br/>“I can handle him,” Charles said calmly. “It’s nothing. and someone has to take her home. She can’t follow us”, pointing at Vera. <br/>She looked straight into his eyes. “if you see you can’t defeat him… retreat immediately.”<br/>Charles nodded, a faint smile touching his lips.<br/>She turned to Reaper and Zander, her voice sharp now. “If anything happens to him, I swear, i will kill both of you.”<br/>“Yes, ma,” they said instantly, bowing again.<br/>Lizzypie left with a heavy heart, Charles watched them go with a smile, then turned back to the men.<br/>“Let’s move,” he said.<br/>The terrified guide stepped forward.</div>
