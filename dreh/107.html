        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div><p>Tracy stared at the screen, then closed her eyes and turned away. The weight of what she had just seen pressed against her chest like a stone.</p><p>Tracy stared at the screen, then squeezed her eyes shut and turned away. The weight of the video sat on her chest like a stone.</p><p>&quot;No...&quot; she whispered, stepping back. &quot;I can&#x27;t. This will ruin him. People will brand him forever.&quot;</p><p>Mrs. Hailey let out a sharp laugh. &quot;Why do you care? You&#x27;re not his wife anymore! He&#x27;s your enemy now. Let&#x27;s watch him fall. He&#x27;s been acting too high and mighty lately.&quot;</p><p>Derek moved closer, his voice low and persuasive. &quot;Look, Tracy. Serena&#x27;s winning. She and Charles stole your spotlight today. That should have been you up there, not them.&quot; He paused, letting the words sink in. &quot;With this video, we can fix everything. Once it gets out, no one will touch Serena again. They&#x27;ll all come back to you.&quot;</p><p>Tracy hesitated again, his words digging deep into her mind. It was true—Serena&#x27;s rise had pushed her into the shadows. The temptation for revenge burned hot and bright.</p><p>Still, she shook her head. “No. I can’t do this.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s tone sharpened. “You are soft. Fragile. That’s why Charles used you throughout your marriage. That poor, useless man took everything from you, and now he’s using Serena to humiliate you. We must act now. This is our only chance.”</p><p>Derek folded his arms. “It’s your decision, Tracy. If you tell us to stop right now, we will. But remember, after this, there will be no other opportunity.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s voice cracked with anger. “They humiliated us in that room just a while ago. I was made to kneel in front of him! Kneel for that man!”</p><p>Tracy clenched her fists. “That’s because you accused him of something you didn’t see.”</p><p>“Does it matter?” Mrs. Hailey snapped.</p><p>Derek’s patience was thinning. “Enough talking. Time is ticking. The ball’s in your court, Tracy.” He raised the phone again, thumb hovering over the screen. “Should we release it?”</p><p>Tracy pressed her hands together, her fingers trembling. She didn&#x27;t know what to say. </p><p>She and Charles weren’t together anymore. Yet deep down, a small, stubborn part of her still cared for him.  She couldn’t imagine what this would do to him once the world saw it.</p><p>But then another thought crept in.</p><p><em>&quot;What about me?&quot;</em></p><p>She had fought her way up from nothing, building her name, her business, her worth. Tonight was supposed to be her night too.</p><p> A chance to stand out, before Serena arrived and stole the light from everyone.</p><p>She remembered the cheers, the way people swarmed around Serena and Charles. The compliments, the smiles. </p><p><em>“That should have been mine.&quot;</em></p><p>Her chest tightened, a mix of envy and anger burning through her. Slowly, she exhaled and whispered, “Release it. After all, it’s his mistake. He should face the consequences, he should put his dick in one place”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey smirked in approval. “Right decision. It’s Charles’s fault, he couldn’t control himself. None of this is on you.”</p><p>Derek nodded eagerly. “Exactly. He’s disgusting. Good thing you divorced him. Why would he cheat on Serena? The man’s a fool. Can&#x27;t be me”</p><p>Tracy sighed. “So… how are you doing it?”</p><p>Derek’s grin widened. “Already taken care of. I have coordinated with the studio crew. When Charles goes up to give his speech, the stage screens will switch automatically and play the video. Everyone will see it.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey clapped softly. “Brilliant.”</p><p>Tracy swallowed hard. “Alright. Just… be quick. The ceremony will start soon.”</p><p>She turned and left the washroom, walking fast down the corridor. She tried to breathe, but something inside her twisted. A sharp pang of guilt strikes her. </p><p>With Tracy gone, Mrs. Hailey exhaled shakily and leaned back against the wall. “That was close,” she muttered. “You were smart to come up with that story so fast.”</p><p>Derek gave a crooked grin. “Yeah, way too close. But it worked. She believed us—and now we have got her on board with the plan. Total blessing.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey nodded, her pulse still racing. “Good. Then let’s focus. Tracy said the event will start soon. We need to be ready before Charles steps on that stage.”</p><p>“What about what we were doing, i haven&#x27;t cum yet”. Derek teased</p><p>“Come on,” Mrs. Hailey said firmly. “Let’s get moving. No more distractions.”</p><p>They left the washroom quietly, slipping back into the hall.</p><p>The hall was alive with music, lights, chatter. Glasses clinked, laughter.</p><p> Then the anchor walked up to the stage, microphone in hand, and the room slowly hushed.</p><p>“Well,” he began with a smile, “I hope everyone’s enjoying themselves tonight. But now, we have come to the moment we are all here for, to celebrate the Best Businesswoman of the Year, Ms. Serena Moretti!”</p><p>The crowd erupted into applause. Cameras flashed. Serena stood, radiant in her silver gown, Charles beside her, smiling proudly as he joined in the clapping.</p><p>The anchor continued, his tone filled with admiration. “Ms. Serena has been an inspiration to women across the country. From her groundbreaking real estate ventures with Moretti Holdings, taking her family company to the next level, to her foundation of  supporting female entrepreneurs, and her record-breaking partnership with the  International Trade Group, she has  proven what vision and determination can do.”</p><p>Cheers filled the room again. “Truly deserving of this honor!”.</p><p>“wow, I want to be like her”.</p><p>Serena’s eyes shimmered, her smile gracious and calm as she bowed slightly in gratitude.</p><p>The anchor turned to the audience. “And now, I think we would all love to hear from the celebrant herself, don’t we?”</p><p>“Yes!” voices rang out across the hall.</p><p>“Then please welcome Ms. Serena Moretti!”</p><p>The crowd cheered as Serena made her way toward the stage, her heels clicking softly on the marble floor. </p><p>From the far end of the hall, near one of the pillars, Derek and Mrs. Hailey stood watching.</p><p>Derek’s lips curled into a grin.</p></div>
