        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div><p>Charles breathed hard, his chest rising and falling as it felt strangely difficult to open his eyes. </p><p>At first, everything was black, thick and suffocating, like his consciousness had been dropped into a void. He forced himself to focus.</p><p>Snap.</p><p>His eyes flew open.</p><p>He found himself standing in the middle of a wide fountain surrounded by short, colorful leaves and strange glowing flowers that swayed gently.</p><p>The air was fresh, clean, almost soothing, carrying a faint floral scent that calmed his nerves instead of heightening them. </p><p>Charles frowned slightly. This was not what he had expected at all.</p><p>“Uh… is this really the Hole Realm,” he muttered, “or did I end up somewhere else?”</p><p>He turned slowly, scanning his surroundings. The field stretched endlessly in every direction, smooth land rolling forward without hills or trees to mark distance. </p><p>No walls. No sky boundaries. Just an infinite plain that seemed to go on forever.</p><p>He sighed. “So where am I supposed to go,” he said to himself, “and where is the Kyoul Stone?”</p><p>There was no guidance,  and he didn&#x27;t know what to do. </p><p>After a moment, he shrugged lightly and began walking straight ahead, without even knowing where he was going. </p><p>“So this is what a realm looks like,” he muttered as he moved forward. “I thought it would be swarming with monsters.”</p><p>He had barely taken a few more steps when he felt something. </p><p>Thud. Thud. </p><p>Charles slowed and lifted his head. He immediately gulped. </p><p>There were monsters in front of him.</p><p>Two of them stood ahead, facing him directly.</p><p>The first looked like a twisted fusion between a wolf and a lizard, its body low to the ground, skin covered in overlapping black scales. Its head was like that of a big snake. </p><p>The second was like a giant spider. It was so big with many legs. If one of the legs hit him, it would do more damage than a sword. </p><p>They stared at him. Growling. </p><p>Charles raised his hands instinctively, palms open, trying to appear non-threatening. “Uh… sorry,” he said awkwardly. “Didn’t mean to disturb you.”</p><p>He stepped back carefully, one foot at a time, attempting to give them space.</p><p>The creatures responded with low growls, the sound vibrating through the air, they didn&#x27;t stop, they kept moving towards Charles. </p><p>Charles kept stepping back slowly, one careful step at a time, his eyes locked on the two monsters as they advanced without hesitation. </p><p>“Okay… okay…” he muttered, breathing unevenly.</p><p>Seeing that they wouldn&#x27;t stop. Charles decided to just turn around and run away from them.  Just as he spun around—his heart nearly stopped.</p><p>The giant spider was already there.</p><p>It loomed directly in front of him, its massive body blocking his escape, multiple legs stabbing into the ground with sharp, clicking sounds. </p><p>Before he could react, the komodo-dragon-like creature growled behind him, cutting off every possible path.</p><p>He was trapped.</p><p>The spider attacked first.</p><p>One enormous leg slammed down toward him with terrifying speed. Charles threw himself sideways, barely avoiding it, the impact cracking the ground where he had stood.</p><p> He rolled and sprang up, but the lizard creature lunged immediately, its massive jaws snapping shut inches from his torso.</p><p>Charles weaved backward.</p><p>Another leg struck him from the side.</p><p>Pain exploded through his ribs as he was sent flying, his body tumbling across the ground before crashing hard near the fountain. He groaned, forcing himself up as the monsters closed in again.</p><p>“They are so fast,” he coughed.</p><p>He dodged another strike, ducked under snapping jaws, but the attacks kept coming from different angles.</p><p> A leg clipped his shoulder, another hit his thigh, tossing him aside like a ragdoll. He rolled, skidded.</p><p>He was fighting barehanded which made it more hard for him. </p><p>“Damn it,” Charles growled as he pushed himself up again.</p><p>He closed his eyes deep and decided to use his power. </p><p>[Eyes of Satan—activated]</p><p>[Soul Sight activated].</p><p>The monsters’ movements were already being predicted by him due to the soul sight, so he was able to weave properly. </p><p>He moved before they did.</p><p>Charles slipped past a crushing leg, slammed his fist into a joint, then twisted away as the lizard’s tail whipped past him. He struck again, faster now, more precise, but his bare hands met scales and hardened chitin.</p><p>The damage was nothing. Using bare-hand won&#x27;t have any effect on them. </p><p>The monsters roared and enraged.</p><p>They attacked together.</p><p>One of the spider legs slammed him down while the lizard lunged, jaws wide and about to eat him. Charles barely rolled aside, feeling the wind of death brush past his face. He came up on one knee, breathing hard.</p><p>This was bad. Too bad.</p><p>Another hit sent him skidding across the ground, his back slamming against a stone edge. The spider reared up, legs raised, while the lizard crawled closer, jaws dripping.</p><p>They were about to finish him.</p><p>Charles forced himself upright.</p><p>“Alright,” he said quietly. “Let finish this up”</p><p>He dashed forward suddenly, baiting them.</p><p>The spider lunged while the lizard followed.</p><p>At the last second, Charles slipped between them, positioning himself so they were lined up together, both towering in front of him.</p><p>His eyeball turned red. </p><p>[Hellfire Beam—activated].</p><p>Two beams of scorching energy erupted from his eyes, tearing through the air in a blinding flash.</p><p>“Yaaaa” he screamed as he directed it at them. </p><p> The spider was hit first, its massive body engulfed instantly as the beam burned straight through it, charring and collapsing on the ground before it could even scream.</p><p>The beam didn’t stop.</p><p>It tore straight into the lizard behind it, flames ripping across its scaled body as it howled, thrashing violently before collapsing into a burning heap.</p><p>Shrrrrrrrk!!!!.</p><p>The monster screamed out of pain. The hell fire beam really took a big effect on them. </p><p>Charles stood there, chest heaving, eyes slowly dimming. He sighed. as his head spun with a headache.</p><p>The hell fire beam is crazy, but the after effect always took him hard. </p><p>The two monsters were groaning weakly on the floor. Not dead yet Charles walked to them to finish the job.</p><p>Just as he was about to use the laser on them once more, to burn them to ash, a voice screamed in his head.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p></p></div>
