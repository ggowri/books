        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div><p>Derek put on a satisfying smirk. He was delighted that Charles was already on the wrong foot with Norman. Why wouldn’t Norman be angry with him? Everyone knew how obsessed Norman was with Serena.</p><p>Being the hottest and richest man in the city, Norman thought he deserved to marry a woman of the same caliber. But he had been consistently rejected. Now, with Charles engaged to Serena, conflict was inevitable.</p><p>Natasha, oblivious to the tension, asked, “Do you two know each other?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Norman sneered, “and I regret ever knowing someone as poor as him. How did he even get in here? Look at his clothes! How did you manage to get Serena engaged to you? You don’t even look human.”</p><p>His insults came sharp and fast.</p><p>Natasha’s eyes widened in surprise. So this man was Serena’s fiancé, the city goddess. But as she glanced at his outfit, she couldn’t help but think it didn’t match such a title at all.</p><p>Charles scoffed. “Even then, I must be important, since you can’t seem to stop talking about me.”</p><p>The bodyguard behind Norman clenched his fists, ready to retaliate, but Norman raised a hand to stop him.</p><p>“You are pathetic. You just spit out whatever makes you feel better. I can&#x27;t stop talking about you, because I don&#x27;t want you around me. You irritate me!”</p><p>Charles&#x27;s laugh was low and dangerous. “Maybe you are angry because I bagged a woman you can’t get, despite all your money and pomp.”</p><p>Norman’s face went red, veins mapping his jaw. “You fuck— I heard you conned her. You staged everything to get her.”</p><p>“Say whatever lets you sleep,” Charles said, cold. “Useless prick.”</p><p>Norman’s hand curled into a fist. “You are overstepping. Do you know who I am? I am the heir of the Consortium.”</p><p>Charles rolled his shoulders, mock-shivering. “Ohhh, I’m shaking. So what? You are heir of bla bla bla, and so fucking what!”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Norman snarled. “So what? I will teach you what it means to be the heir. I will beat you here, and no one, not even the police, will touch me.”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “Like you could do anything to me.”</p><p>Norman turned, calling to the hulking men at his side. The bodyguards were gigantic — they looked as if their palms could crush someone with a single slap.</p><p>“Beat him. Crack every bone. Make him kneel,” Norman yelled.</p><p>Natasha stepped instinctively closer to Charles. “Please  don’t offend Norman. You seem decent, brave… and I like that. But Norman is a monster. Just apologise and let it go.” Her voice faltered.</p><p>Charles’s mouth curved. He was so confident, and many people in the store had their eyes on them. He refused to be pushed around anymore, like he had been when he was with Tracy.</p><p>“I fear no one. Except God.” He spread his hands as if offering himself up. “Let him bring it on.”</p><p>Norman’s grin was a knife. “Seems you are begging for death.” He snapped an order and the two bodyguards surged forward.</p><p>[Eyes of Satan activated.]</p><p>Everything slowed.</p><p>Charles could see their movements clearly, and slowly. Every muscle stretch, every weak point glowing before him.</p><p>One aimed a heavy punch which Charles tilted his head back to avoid; he struck back instantly and hit the man’s throat with precise force.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The guard dropped to the floor, gasping for air.</p><p>The second was surprised but still charged. He swung wildly. Charles stepped aside and hit him straight in the scrotum.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The man’s body folded instantly, knees crashing to the floor. Both guards lay groaning at Charles’s feet.</p><p>The whole store froze. Norman and Derek stared in shock. How could Charles move that fast? How could a man who looked so simple fight like that?</p><p>Norman’s face turned red. It was unbelievable to him, but he didn&#x27;t want to look weak. “You think knowing a few tricks makes you a man?” he yelled.</p><p>Charles’s eyes darkened. “Say one more nonsense, and I will break your legs.”</p><p>Norman’s heart skipped. He forced a laugh to cover his fear. “I will show you what a real man is!” He turned sharply to Natasha. “Hey, Natasha! Throw him out this instant. He just disrespected me!”</p><p>Natasha blinked. She knew what that meant. All her raw stones came from the Consortium mines.</p><p>They were the biggest supplier in the city. They controlled every flow, and their competitors struggled to find suppliers. They had to beg them, pay money before they could have a successful business. Which meant every other mine, especially raw-stone mines, was controlled by the Consortium.</p><p>If she went against Norman, it could destroy her business. No more stones.</p><p>Natasha gulped and faced Charles. Charles was a little worried. This was the only place he could earn the forty million dollars he needed.</p><p>He told Natasha, “Don&#x27;t tell me you are going to listen to him and throw me out because he said so.”</p><p>Natasha just stared at him for a few moments and sighed. She was someone who had never treated people badly, let alone someone who was her customer.</p><p>Sending Charles out would be an insult, and that would be wrong to someone who had just helped her.</p><p>She faced Norman. “Young master, can we please settle this amicably? We don&#x27;t need to take this this far.”</p><p>Norman frowned in anger. “Are you teasing me right now? I said you should send him out. It’s not up for debate — do that right now!”</p><p>Natasha was lost and didn&#x27;t know what to say.</p><p>Derek chimed in, “Natasha, this is not a hard decision. You know the consequences of not listening to young master Norman. He is a poor man who always targets rich women to get ahead. You don&#x27;t need to ruin your career because of him.”</p><p>Norman was pleased by how Derek made it clear; he put on a smile.</p><p>Derek added, “It&#x27;s not something hard. Just order your bodyguard to send him out, that&#x27;s all.”</p><p>Natasha then faced Charles. Everyone was waiting, wondering what her decision would be.</p></div>
