        <h1>chapter 111</h1>
        <div><p>Serena and Charles reached home. Serena was a little shook by the event and her eyes were still echoing from the Gunshots. She lay down on the bed in her room. </p><p>Her family surrounded her. Collins, Allison, Mr. Moretti himself and other members</p><p>“Serena! Are you okay?” Mr. Morretti frantically asked. </p><p>“What happened?” Allison demanded.</p><p>Even though Charles already recounted what happened they still kept asking, and Serena explained it well.</p><p>“They open fire on you?  Three of them. How do you manage to survive?”, Collins shrieked.</p><p>Mr. Morreti, boiling in anger, rolled his fist, “Who dares do this to my daughter!”.</p><p>Collins pushed forward first, eyes red with anger.</p><p>“This is your fault, Charles!” he shouted. “Everywhere you go, trouble follows. And now Serena almost died because of you!, i am sure the gummen were there because of you, Serena was dragged into this because of you”</p><p>Allion didn’t even try to calm him. He joined in.</p><p>“Yes! Exactly! You have been causing issues all over the place. I even heard there is a  scandal today about your ex-wife and that you even upset Norman, and now gunmen? You brought danger right to her!”.</p><p>One of the cousins also nodded, “I have never supported this relationship in the first place. This man is very poor and full of disaster!”.</p><p>Then, Mr. Damien, his uncle chimed in. “Serena, they are right.  We have never had gun attacks around here. This started when he came into your life.”</p><p>Charles stood quietly, jaw clenched, letting them speak.</p><p>Serena looked at him, then at all of them. She raised her voice, sharp and clear:</p><p>“Stop it!” Serena exhaled shakily. “They did not come for Charles. They came for me.”</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Collins frowned. “What do you mean? How can you know that”</p><p>Serena started, “When the shooting started, one of them said, ‘Don’t let her escape.’ Not him. They are because of me, if not for Charles,  I would have died right there. Don&#x27;t disrespect him”</p><p>Murmurs broke out.</p><p>Allion blinked. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Serena said firmly. </p><p>Collins was very angry and said, “This doesn&#x27;t make sense. What if the reason they are attacking you was because of him. Who knows, maybe his ex wife still has feelings for him and wants you gone. This poor man with no background is certainly the reason.”</p><p>Serena groaned, “Can you just shut up!. And stop making things up”.</p><p>“I am your older brother, respect me. This is exactly the reason you can&#x27;t lead this family and its company, you can&#x27;t get over a poor man that will ruin your life. Our future isn&#x27;t safe with her with this man by her side. I am the rightful heir”, He sneered.</p><p>Even in such a critical moment, all he could think of was the heir position. </p><p>“Shut up!!! That&#x27;s the reason I can never give my company to you, you inconsiderate brat”, Mr. Moretti yelled at him, he recoiled.</p><p>Then Mr. Moretti turned to Serena, his face tense with concern. “Serena… why would gunmen target you?”</p><p>Serena swallowed hard, looking around at everyone. “I don’t know yet. But someone clearly wants me gone. Even before I met Charles, I was attacked if you could remember,  there is someone behind it”.</p><p>Mr. Moretti breathed in anger, “I swear we will find whoever it is… even if I have to use the Godfather influence ,  I will kneel for him. No one touches my daughter”.</p><p>Everyone knew the Godfather’s part was bluffing,  because no way Mr. Moretti would even set eyes on Godfather. Meanwhile,  Charles just stayed calm.</p><p>After everyone checked Serena thoroughly and confirmed she wasn’t hurt, Mr. Moretti gave a relieved exhale.</p><p>“You two should rest,” he said firmly. “I will find the mastermind behind this. I promise.”</p><p>Everyone nodded and slowly left the room, closing the door behind them, leaving only Charles and Serena inside.</p><p>Serena turned to Charles.</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered. “You saved my life today. I couldn&#x27;t even imagine what would have happened without you there”</p><p>Charles smiled and nodded, “It&#x27;s nothing. I just did what I must do”.</p><p>She stepped closer, her voice gentler and more softer.</p><p>“You always protect me… even when I don’t expect it.”</p><p>She moved closer again, too close, her hand touching his chest, she tugged his chest and pulled him closer.   She leaned in, slowly, and pressed her lips on his.</p><p>Charles kissed her back also. As they exchanged tongues. </p><p>She wrapped her arms around him, pressing closer, then she started unbuttoning his shirt. </p><p>Her heartbeat raced as she whispered, “Charles… I want you in me. Please can we have sex”</p><p>But Charles froze. He didn&#x27;t expect Serena to pull this. Since she always acts high classy and even sets boundaries. </p><p>Charles&#x27;s dick got hard instantly. Of course it did. Serena was the hottest woman in this city, and she was basically begging for it.</p><p>He was all ready to go, his hand already grabbing her tit. But then he suddenly stopped.</p><p>&quot;Wait... are you a virgin?&quot; he asked.</p><p>Serena&#x27;s body didn&#x27;t like him stopping. She pressed herself against him, pushing her big soft breast into his hand. After everything that happened today, she wanted him to touch her - hell, she wanted it rough. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said softly, blushing. &quot;I want you to be my first, Charles.&quot;</p><p>Charles swallowed hard, his thumb rubbing her hard nipple through her clothes. He could only imagine how good it would feel without anything between them. But then he remembered - banging Serena now would be a total waste. She was a virgin, and he needed seven more virgins to unlock his full power. He couldn&#x27;t just waste one right now.</p><p>His current power, Soul Sight, wasn&#x27;t strong enough yet. Fucking a virgin now wouldn&#x27;t give him any upgrade. So he decided to save her for later.</p><p>He forced himself to pull his hand back, trying to ignore how her thick thighs were rubbing together. She was definitely wet - he could even smell how turned on she was. He looked away and said, &quot;Uh... can we do this some other time?&quot;</p><p>Serena&#x27;s face dropped. Her pride was completely shattered.</p><p>&quot;What? Wait... did you just turn me down?&quot;</p><p>Serena couldn&#x27;t believe it. She was every man&#x27;s fantasy, and this guy was actually saying no?</p><p>Charles swallowed again. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying no... just, can we do it later?&quot;</p><p>Serena laughed angrily. &quot;You&#x27;re still hung up on your ex-wife, aren&#x27;t you? How pathetic. I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re rejecting me. Your loss, not mine.&quot;</p><p>Charles found Serena’s anger a little funny, then said, “This is not about my ex-wife… it’s—”</p><p>He was cut off by his phone ringing on the bed. The screen lit up and  displayed Tracy.</p><p>Serena could see the name clearly.</p></div>
