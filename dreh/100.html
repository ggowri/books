        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div><p>Natalie groaned as she opened her eyes. Everything was at first blurry, and she couldn’t hear anything. Her head vibrated with pain.</p><p>“Hey, are you there? Are you awake? How are you feeling?” a voice echoed beside her. She immediately recognized it as Charles, as everything became clear.</p><p>She was on a hospital bed. Charles was holding her hand with care, while there was this woman that always followed him everywhere beside him. She remembered her name was Lizzypie.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Charles asked again, worry and concern filling his face.</p><p>The last scene before she fainted rushed back to her head, the way Mr. Jim’s head blew off just like that.</p><p>She panicked, and asked, “Where is my brother? Is he okay?”</p><p>“Yes, he is. He was just as shocked as you, but he’s already home. He will be fine,” Charles assured her.</p><p>She sighed in relief. Even though she and her brother had their issues, that was her only family.</p><p>Then she sat up straight and demanded, “What… What is it that happened to Sir Jim? I’m sure you didn’t do anything to him, or is that punch what made his head just blow off like that?”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly. “Nope, a punch can’t do that.”</p><p>That moment, Lizzypie chimed in. “Well, that’s OnyxChip. It’s a modern weapon—very deadly and multi-tasked. It’s a small chip that can be used to track, monitor, record, and even be used as a bomb if inserted in someone’s body. Someone pressed the button and made Sir Jim explode with the chip.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “If it was inserted in his head, it means Mr. Jim was aware of it.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded in agreement. “Yeah, usually it’s used in secret organizations or spy agencies. They use it as insurance—to kill the person if he’s about to give in or betray them. The victim doesn’t even have time to say anything before they’re killed.”</p><p>Natalie was finding it very hard to believe what Lizzypie was saying. It seemed like something drawn straight out of a sci-fi movie. “I know Sir Jim,” she said weakly. “I grew up knowing him with my parents. He worked loyally for them, and that’s the reason he was willing to even serve my brother. How could he be in a secret organization?”</p><p>Lizzypie shrugged. “I don’t know, but the chip killed him. They usually use it in vital moments. What’s the last thing he said?”</p><p>Charles raised his head, tense. “Fuck… he was talking about my father. He said he knew my father—he wanted to say something about him before that thing happened.”</p><p>Hearing this, they all grew silent. Something wasn’t right. Charles’s parents were killed in an accident years ago by some unknown people, as Lizzypie had once told him. What if Sir Jim was among them?</p><p>Natalie also claimed Sir Jim had worked for her father since she was little—over twenty-five years. What if his father also knew something about this?</p><p>Charles said, “Your brother, Steven… he seemed like he knew me too. He said I looked familiar. Maybe he knows something.”</p><p>After a long and proper talk, Lizzypie told them, “We can’t jump to conclusions yet, but we have to investigate this properly. And because of that, Natalie will really help us a lot. She’s now part of our team. We will investigate this together—and that starts from questioning your brother, Natalie.”</p><p>Natalie, who was still on the sick bed, nodded slowly. She only hoped her father wouldn’t turn out to be a villain in this, because that would ruin her relationship with Charles completely.</p><p>After that, they talked about other things, and Charles was astonished by how quickly Lizzypie and Natalie connected. They laughed and joked like they had known each other for years. Charles smiled at the sight.</p><p>---</p><p>A week later.</p><p>The week came faster, and the Business Party of the Year—organized by the International Awards Association (IAA) was finally here. Everywhere was glowing with life: chandeliers dripping gold light, the scent of perfume mixing with wine, cameras flashing, and chatter echoing across the grand ballroom.</p><p>The winners had already been announced, and this was just the formal celebration where the elites came to show their faces and power.</p><p>Just then, a sleek black Mercedes-Benz purred to a stop in front of the red carpet. It was the most expensive car there that night. Cameras immediately turned, flashes raining like lightning as everyone anticipated who it was.</p><p>The driver stepped down and opened the passenger door.</p><p>Then, he came out—it was Charles, dressed sharply in an Italian designer suit that hugged his frame perfectly. He quickly moved to the other side, opening the door for Serena, taking her hand gently as she stepped out.</p><p>Gasps followed.</p><p>Serena looked breathtaking—dressed in a shimmering wine-red gown that hugged her curves and spilled into a flowing train. Her hair cascaded over one shoulder, diamonds glittering around her neck.</p><p>Whispers filled the air.</p><p>“That’s Ms. Serena. She’s the lady of the year. God, I’m so jealous.”</p><p>“Her fiancé is that guy, right? Damn, he’s lucky.”</p><p>“I have more money than him, though. How did he manage to bag her?”</p><p>“She’s beautiful, rich, and smart—and yet she’s with that pauper? I hope he doesn’t disgrace her tonight.”</p><p>Serena could hear it all, but she ignored the whispers. With quiet grace, she and Charles walked elegantly up the red carpet, heads high, the perfect couple under the lights.</p><p>Just as they were about to step into the main hall, a hand gripped Serena’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hey, bitch.”</p><p>Serena froze and turned sharply—shocked. Standing there was Tracy, glaring at her with burning eyes, as if she could swallow her whole. Beside her stood Derek and her mother, Mrs. Hailey.</p><p>“Wait… did you just call me a bitch?” Serena asked in disbelief. She didn’t even have any personal issue with Tracy. Yes, she knew Tracy was Charles’s ex-wife, but they had never confronted each other directly.</p><p>“Yes,” Tracy sneered, her lips curling. “I’m referring to you, you bitch. Why are you surprised to hear it?”</p><p>The air around them stiffened instantly. People nearby turned their heads, murmuring, phones already rising for a better look.</p></div>
