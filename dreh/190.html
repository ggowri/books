        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div><p>Sapphire’s support had been intense, almost too emotional and too personal. For a brief moment, Serena wondered if there was something more behind it.</p><p> Then she shook the thought away and exhaled softly. Maybe she was just overthinking it. Sapphire simply seemed like a good person who hated injustice.</p><p>Linda, Collins, and Tracy rose in silence, faces burning with shame. Without another word, they turned and hurried out of the lobby.</p><p>Only then did Sapphire turn fully toward Serena.</p><p>“I’m truly sorry for the uncultured behavior you encountered in my company,” she said sincerely.</p><p> “That isn’t how things are supposed to be here. Those were just a few unruly people abusing their positions.”</p><p>Serena smiled, the tension finally easing from her shoulders. “It’s okay,” she replied. “Honestly, I’m impressed by how you handled everything.”</p><p>Sapphire returned the smile. “Thanks for the understanding. Come with me,” she said. “Let’s talk in my office.”</p><p>She led them away from the lobby, her presence naturally guiding the flow of people aside. Inside her office, the atmosphere was calmer, quieter, far removed from the chaos outside. </p><p>Sapphire took the proposal file from Serena and went through it carefully, page by page.</p><p>When she finished, she looked up, clearly impressed.</p><p>She said thoughtfully, “this proposal stands on its own. I love this. We will work together.”</p><p>Serena blinked, caught off guard. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sapphire said with a small smile. “I’m genuinely impressed.”</p><p>Serena’s face lit up. “Wow… thank you so much.”</p><p>Even though Charles already requested her to accept Serena. The proposal itself stood out, and Serena seemed worth working with.</p><p>She quickly brought out a draft file, hands still buzzing with excitement, and placed it on the desk. Sapphire reviewed it briefly, nodded in approval, and set it aside.</p><p>Throughout it all, she never once acted as though she knew Charles. </p><p>When everything was settled, Sapphire closed the folder. “We will meet again to finalize things,” she said. “The new COO will also stamp the file.”</p><p>Serena stood and extended her hand. “I look forward to working with you.”</p><p>Sapphire shook it, smiling. “Likewise.”</p><p>As Serena and Charles turned to leave, Serena felt lighter than she had all day,  she was so happy that she could barely contain it.</p><p>After Quincy stamped the file and signed it officially, Serena finally let out the breath she had been holding for hours. </p><p>They walked out of the building together and the moment the doors slid shut behind them, Serena threw her hands up, laughing.</p><p>“I did it,” she said breathlessly. “I really did it, Charles.”</p><p>Charles smiled as he walked beside her. “I told you. You’d eat it up.”</p><p>She glanced at him, eyes bright. “Good thing Collins messed everything up. I always knew he could never lead the family with that kind of behavior.”</p><p>Then she added, excitement creeping into her voice, “With this deal, I will surely become the permanent CEO. With full authority and Immunity.”</p><p>They got into the car and drove off, the city rolling past the windows as Serena leaned back in her seat, still smiling.</p><p>Charles drove.</p><p>After a moment, Serena turned to him, her tone softer, more thoughtful. </p><p>“Don’t you think Ms. Sapphire was… too nice to us,” she asked. “Almost like she knew us already. And you said you knew her. Is that really true? Do you two know each other?”</p><p>Charles’ grip tightened slightly on the steering wheel.</p><p>He swallowed and sighed. He had thought about keeping it a secret, but If Serena found out later, she would feel betrayed. He decided to just tell him.</p><p>He was just about to speak.</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>His phone vibrated.</p><p>He frowned but kept his eyes on the road.</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Annoyed, he reached for it and glanced down.</p><p>The message was from Tracy.</p><p>His expression darkened as he read.</p><p>[Collins wants to harm you. He has hired some people.]</p><p>Another message came immediately.</p><p>[Don’t cross the bridge. They are waiting to ambush you.]</p><p>Charles lifted his head slowly. The bridge was right ahead.</p><p>Serena noticed the shift in his expression. “Hey,” she said carefully. “What’s wrong? You look troubled.”</p><p>Charles scoffed lightly, masking it. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>He didn’t slow down.</p><p>The car rolled forward and entered the bridge anyway.</p><p>Charles didn’t fear at all. Not even a flicker.</p><p>What surprised him was Tracy warning him at all.</p><p>As the car reached the middle of the bridge, he casually checked the side mirror. Two dark vans were closing in fast, one from behind, another sliding in from the left lane.</p><p>Tracy was right.</p><p>He kept driving.</p><p>The first van swerved suddenly, trying to ram his rear bumper and force him into the rail. </p><p>Charles’ pupils sharpened </p><p>[Eyes of Satan activated].</p><p>He used this to move faster.</p><p>[ Eyes of Soul activated].</p><p>He used this to predict their next moves. unfolding in his mind before they happened.</p><p>He twisted the steering wheel just enough.</p><p>The van smashed into empty space, clipping only air, its tires screeching as it slammed into the bridge barrier instead.</p><p>Serena gasped. “Charles! What the heck is happening!.. who are…”</p><p>Before she could finish, the second van accelerated and tried to box them in from the front. </p><p>A man leaned out of the window, arm raised, as he brought out a gun. Ready to shoot.</p><p>Charles tapped the brake once, sharply.</p><p>Their car dipped back while the van overshot, momentum carrying it forward. In the same motion, Charles yanked the wheel and slammed the accelerator, their car sliding sideways in a controlled drift that barely missed the attacker’s door.</p><p>Metal scraped and  Sparks flew.</p><p>Another vehicle appeared behind them, trying to trap them completely. Charles saw it before it happened, the angles, the timing.</p><p>He sped up, then suddenly cut across lanes. The van behind followed too aggressively, tires losing grip. Charles clipped its front corner just enough.</p><p>The van spun.</p><p>It hit the side rail, flipped once, then twice, crashing onto its roof with a violent screech that echoed across the bridge.</p><p>Serena covered her mouth, heart pounding.</p><p>Charles then finally pressed the brake, as the three vans were on the ground in front of them. Steaming. </p><p></p></div>
