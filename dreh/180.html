        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div><p>Mr. Damien stepped backward when he saw Charles. There was a gun in his hand.</p><p>“What the fuck is all this? What do you want from me? You already had my assets and properties taken and frozen. Why did you bring me here?” he cried out.</p><p>At that moment, he turned and tried to run, but Lizzypie stepped in front of him and blocked his path, double-crossing him.</p><p>There was nowhere to run.</p><p>Charles raised the gun and pointed it at him. Killing had once been difficult for him, but that was before he killed Razor. He had already convinced himself that people like Damien deserved to die.</p><p>Mr. Damien turned back to him and immediately dropped to his knees. “Don’t kill me. What are you doing this for? I’ll give you anything you want. Please, just don’t kill me.”</p><p>Charles scoffed and said, “Do you know how many people you’ve killed? You sold little girls for money. </p><p>You murdered your competitors. You don’t deserve to live.”</p><p>Mr. Damien refused to give up and kept begging for his life. He even said, “Tell me who hired you and how much they paid. I will triple it.”</p><p>Charles bent down close to him and said, “I don’t think you can pay more than the person who sent me to kill you. Because that person is the Godfather.”</p><p>Mr. Damien froze in shock. He had heard of the Godfather and he knew how powerful he was.</p><p>His throat tightened as he gulped.</p><p>“The Godfather?” he whispered. “What did I do? Why would he want me dead? I don’t even know who he really is.”</p><p>“You have done many terrible things,” Charles said coldly. “Maybe one of them is connected to him.”</p><p>Mr. Damien shook his head, confused and panicked. “Why would I do that? How would I dare offend the Godfather?”</p><p>Charles’s eyes narrowed, and decided to find out the reason Godfather wanted him dead. “Well… does the name Vincent ring a bell?”</p><p>Lizzypie immediately snapped, “Charles!” Her voice was sharp. He wasn&#x27;t supposed to say the name.</p><p>Charles didn’t look away. “He’s dying anyway.”</p><p>Mr. Damien went quiet. His eyes shifted as his mind worked, then he slowly raised his head.</p><p>“Vincent?” he muttered. “Wait… Vincent?”</p><p>It was obvious he knew the name.</p><p>Charles tensed. If Damien knew his grandfather, then he would know his father.</p><p>“I know Vincent,” Mr. Damien said carefully. “Wait… is he still alive?”</p><p>There was a brief, heavy silence.</p><p>“Don’t tell me…” Mr. Damien’s voice trembled. “He’s the Godfather? Is he? No. That’s impossible.”</p><p>Charles frowned and stepped closer. “You know my grandfather,” he said. “Mr. Vincent. How?”</p><p>Mr. Damien nodded repeatedly, almost in denial. “You are his grandson. That means you are his son!. No… no. This shouldn’t be happening.”</p><p>“Tell me,” Charles growled. “How did you know him? What shouldn’t happen”</p><p>Mr. Damien lifted his head, his lips parting. “I—”</p><p>Kaboom.</p><p>Splash.</p><p>Blood splattered across Charles’s face as Mr. Damien collapsed to the ground, a bullet hole in his head.</p><p>Charles glared at Lizzypie. She was the one who fired the shot.</p><p>“Why did you do that?” he snapped. “He was about to tell me something.”</p><p>“That’s exactly why I killed him,” Lizzypie replied calmly.</p><p>Charles stared at her in disbelief. “Why would you do that?”</p><p>“Because the Godfather instructed me to kill him the moment he decided to tell you anything.”</p><p>Charles felt anger surge through him, hot and sharp. “Why?” he demanded. “Why would he want that? He asked me to kill this man, yet he won’t even tell me the reason?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded once. “Yes. And that’s exactly what you’re going to do. Complete your mission without asking questions.”</p><p>“But why?” Charles said, his voice rising. “What’s the point of this mission if the truth is being kept from me?”</p><p>Lizzypie looked at him for a long moment. “Remember, this mission is optional. You can opt out. If that’s what you want, tell me now and I’ll report it to him.”</p><p>She turned and walked toward the car.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?” she called out. “Let’s go.”</p><p>The ride back to the hotel was quiet. No one spoke.</p><p>When they arrived and stepped inside, Sapphire, Amara, and Tina were glued to the television. The news was playing footage of Mr. Damien’s collapse and how his assets had been seized, how his empire had fallen overnight.</p><p>The moment they saw Charles, their faces lit up.</p><p>“Yay! Uncle Charles!” Amara and Tina shouted together as they ran to him and wrapped their arms around him.</p><p>“You did it!” Amara said excitedly. “You saved our friend!”</p><p>“Thank you so much, Uncle Charles,” Tina added. “I can’t believe you exposed Mr. Damien all by yourself and made him lose everything. I watched the footage from the banquet. You were so cool.”</p><p>Charles smiled faintly and said, “I didn’t do it alone.” He pointed toward Lizzypie.</p><p>They immediately turned to her, bowing slightly in gratitude.</p><p>“Thank you so much, aunt,” Amara said.</p><p>“We are very grateful”, Tina added.</p><p>Lizzypie stiffened at the word aunt. She scoffed lightly and said nothing.</p><p>Sapphire stepped forward, unable to hide her excitement. “Paul even confessed about the  stage video. Everything went perfectly.” She smiled warmly at them. “Thank you, both of you. I heard Mr. Damien was arrested. I hope he never escapes.”</p><p>She didn’t know he was dead.</p><p>Charles scoffed quietly. “Yeah. He won’t escape.”</p><p>At that moment, Lizzypie’s phone vibrated. She glanced at the screen, her expression shifting. Without a word, she excused herself and hurried away.</p><p>Charles frowned. Something felt wrong, but Lizzypie had already disappeared into her room.</p><p>Inside, she looked down at the message that had just arrived.</p><p>(Remember. It&#x27;s the end of this month. You have to be here.)</p><p></p></div>
