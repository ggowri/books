        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div><p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p><p>The sound of boots hit the floor like thunder. Then mercenaries marched in, guns in their hands, pointing everywhere. The whole place went stiff. No one dared to move.</p><p>A man walked in behind the mercenaries. His steps were heavy, steady, full of power. Charles raised his head weakly. For a moment, he thought it was his grandfather. But it wasn’t. It was Rain…the man who first came to meet him.</p><p>Everyone knew Rain. He was the Godfather’s right hand. To see him was the same as seeing the Godfather. Since the Godfather usually didn’t show himself, he hid his identity so much, but always sent Rain.</p><p>Fear filled the room.</p><p>Tiger’s hand shook, the gun dropped from his grip. “Sir Rain, please… How can I be of help?”</p><p>Rain didn’t even look at him. His eyes went straight to Noxon and Scorpion.</p><p>“Do you know who you just touched?”</p><p>The two froze. Their glowing blue eyes dimmed.</p><p>Rain lifted his hand.</p><p>“For what they have done, break their legs!”</p><p>At once, mercenaries rushed forward. Two grabbed Noxon, two grabbed Scorpion. </p><p>The brothers tried to fight back, since they had superpowers but the mercenaries were faster, stronger. Something surprising happened, they formed a magic ball in their hands and hurled it at Noxon and Scorpion. The mercenaries struck them down with it, forcing them to the ground with ease.</p><p>Charles gulped, realizing even his level 2 Eyes of Satan were still child’s play compared to them.</p><p>“Boss!” Scorpion shouted, struggling. “Help us! Boss, don’t let them do this!”</p><p>“Boss!” Noxon cried, as they tried to break his legs.</p><p>Tiger’s face was white with fear. He begged,</p><p>“No! Please, Rain, don’t! They are my best fighters. Without them I am nothing. Please… spare them.”</p><p>Rain finally looked at him. His eyes were like ice.</p><p>“You don’t understand. You didn’t just beat a man. You touched someone the Godfather values. For that… you must pay.”</p><p>Tiger was stunned. He looked at Charles and said, “Him?… fuck! I didn’t know he was someone important to you. I… I…”</p><p>Rain ignored him and turned back to the mercenaries.</p><p>“Break them.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Noxon screamed as his leg snapped.</p><p>Scorpion’s arm twisted the wrong way until the bone cracked. He shouted, “Boss! Please! Please!”</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The mercenaries snapped their bones without pity. Their screams filled the whole place. The men who once looked so strong were now broken on the floor, crying for help.</p><p>Tiger shook his head, tears in his eyes.</p><p>“No… please… Sir Rain, I didn’t know. Please forgive me!”</p><p>Rain walked closer and snapped his fingers. Another group of mercenaries entered through the door. They were dragging Majik, Tiger’s son.</p><p>His face was battered and swollen. Clearly, he had been properly beaten.</p><p>“Father… please save me,” he mumbled weakly, unable to even stand.</p><p>Tiger cried out, “No, my son! He is innocent. I did all this, please let my son live!”</p><p>Rain said, “Your son was the one who caused trouble, sexually assaulted someone, and you still had the audacity to want to rape her yourself! You and your son will suffer for it!”</p><p>“Ha… please! We are sorry! We will do anything!. help me beg the Godfather, release my son!” Tiger pleaded like a child.</p><p>Rain’s eyes stayed cold as stone.</p><p>“Your son will not go free. He will be taken. Every single day, he will be punished for what he did. He will taste pain again and again. The only way he will be released… is if you turn all your property into money and give it all to the Godfather. That is your punishment.”</p><p>Tiger’s face went pale. “What? That means… I will lose everything. I will become poor if I give you everything!”</p><p>Rain leaned closer, his voice sharp.</p><p>“Yes. That is the essence. Refuse—and you will watch your son suffer to death.”</p><p>He snapped his fingers. The mercenaries dragged Majik forward. The boy screamed, weak and broken.</p><p>“Father! Please! Save me! Please don’t let them take me!”</p><p>Tiger fell to the floor, crying like a child. “No! My son… Please don’t take him! I will do anything! Please!”</p><p>But Rain didn’t stop them. The mercenaries dragged Majik out, his voice fading with cries of pain and fear.</p><p>Tiger tried to crawl after them, but two rifles blocked his path. He slammed his fists on the floor, tears rolling down his cheeks.</p><p>The almighty Tiger was crying like a baby. Charles now understood how powerful his grandfather could be.</p><p>Does that mean he would get all this power if he also became the Godfather?</p><p>Charles slowly pulled himself up, blood still running down his face. He helped Tracy to her feet, and they followed as Rain and the mercenaries marched outside.</p><p>The sight outside was worse. Bodies of Tiger’s men were scattered on the ground. Some shot, some beaten so brutally their bones bent the wrong way. The air stank of gunpowder and blood. It was a brutal massacre.</p><p>Up ahead, a helicopter waited.</p><p>Tk tk tk tk tk. The blades roared.</p><p>Rain and his men pushed Majik inside while the others climbed in.</p><p>Charles and Tracy stood there, staring as the chopper lifted into the sky. The lights faded into the dark clouds until it was gone.</p><p>Tracy turned to Charles, her eyes burning with questions.</p><p>“So… you know the Godfather? How?”</p><p>Charles froze. He was asking himself the same thing. Mr. Vincent had told him before that he would never help him.</p><p>Yet here, Rain had come with troops, saving him from death.</p><p>Tracy stepped closer, her voice sharp.</p><p>“Answer me. They almost killed you, and the Godfather’s men came for you. It’s obvious he was really mad that they touched you, which means you must mean something important to him. Tell me the truth. You really know him.”</p><p>Charles looked at her long and hard. He didn’t see any reason to keep it hidden anymore. So he answered, straight-faced:</p><p>“Yes. I know him. And he knows me.”</p></div>
