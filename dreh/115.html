        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div>Charles didn’t know whether to scold Lizzypie for doing what he told her to stop… or praise her. The outcome was far bigger than anything he expected. <br/>With this, his dream of becoming an entrepreneur,  a real businessman  suddenly felt possible again. He had abandoned that dream long ago.<br/> But now he wanted it back. Even without becoming the Godfather, wealth was already coming his way.<br/>Eventually, he thanked Lizzypie.<br/>Lizzypie folded her arms. “I’m sorry I went ahead and exposed Tracy, but I had to. Mr. Vincent has been pressuring me a lot about it.”<br/>Charles nodded. “Is okay, I understand”.<br/>They smiled at each other.<br/>Then Lizzypie checked her phone, and her mood changed instantly.<br/>“Who’s that from?” Charles asked.<br/>She scoffed and hid her expression. “Nothing.”<br/>Charles frowned. “You are hiding something from me. You aren’t telling me. What is it, Lizzypie?”<br/>She said, “Just personal stuff. None of your business,” and she stormed off to her room. <br/>Charles exhaled sharply. He really wanted to know what she was keeping from him.<br/>Just then, his phone rang. Serena.<br/>He cleared his throat before picking up.<br/>Serena excitedly said from over the phone. “I found the hideout of the thugs. Please come so we can go together.”<br/>Charles blinked.<br/>“Really? Okay, I’m on my way.”<br/>He rushed into the bathroom, took the fastest shower of his life, got dressed in a clean fit, and headed straight out.<br/>He arrived at the Moretti building in a cab.<br/>When he reached the front steps, he saw Serena and Fred, her personal bodyguard, standing near a row of black SUVs. The morning air was tense.<br/>They exchanged a subtle greeting.<br/>Serena stepped toward him, her expression cold and focused.<br/>“I did some tracking and investigation,” she said. “We managed to find where the thugs live.”<br/>“I want you to follow me,” Serena continued. “I will need your fighting skill.”<br/>Charles nodded without hesitation, then looked around. There was only a small convoy, one car filled with guards, maybe ten men.<br/>He frowned.<br/>“Aren’t we calling the police?”<br/>Serena scoffed lightly.<br/>“No. I’m not handing them to the police. I’m going there to kill them after I torture them for information about who sent them.”<br/>Charles didn’t react, just nodded.<br/>He examined the guards again, counting silently.<br/>“So… is this all?” he asked. “Hope we won’t be outnumbered. These men aren’t up to twenty.”<br/>Serena gave him a look.<br/>“You are underestimating our guards. Many of them are retired soldiers. And I already sent men to surround the area ahead of time. The thugs aren’t many either, maybe twenty at most. We will take them by surprise. It’s fine.”<br/>Charles nodded slowly.<br/>“Alright.”<br/>Moments later, Fred and the guards entered one car, while Serena and Charles got into another<br/>.<br/>Charles sat in the driver’s seat and started the engine.<br/>For a while, the ride was silent, only the hum of the car and the sound of the road under the tires. Then Serena finally spoke.<br/>“About last night…”<br/>Charles’ jaw tightened.<br/>“Oh… that. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to reject you—”<br/>“It’s okay,” Serena cut in. “It won’t be happening again. And… I’m sorry for making such an inappropriate advance.”<br/>Charles wanted to say no, it wasn’t inappropriate, but Serena didn’t let him. She was so embarrassed by Charles’ rejection.<br/>“And also,” she continued calmly, “my father is giving me the company officially next week. So… after that week, we can break up.”<br/>Charles stared at the road.<br/>“Oh.”<br/>He just nodded, without responding further.<br/>After some minutes, they arrived at a large uncompleted building and parked some distance away. It was old and the whole place looked abandoned and perfect for criminals to hide.<br/>They stepped out of the car.<br/>Fred approached them quickly, speaking in a low, controlled voice.<br/>“I already studied the entire building. We will sneak in from the east side, climb through the back corridor, and then ambush the thugs in their main hideout room.”<br/>Serena nodded sharply.<br/>She grabbed a bulletproof vest from one of the guards and slipped it on, tightening the straps. Fred handed her a gun, and she checked it with practiced hands.<br/>Charles reached for a weapon too, but refused the bulletproof vest.<br/>Serena turned to him immediately.<br/>“What are you doing? Put it on.”<br/>Charles shook his head.<br/>“It’s too heavy. I don’t need it.”<br/>Serena stared at him, partly annoyed, partly concerned, but didn’t argue more.<br/>He grabbed a small pistol instead.<br/>Fred motioned them forward, leading the group in a silent line along the shadowed side of the building. <br/>They entered, with Fred signalling when to stop. All of them with their guns prepared. They took a staircase. When they reached the landing, they stopped.<br/>A flickering light glowed under a door ahead.<br/>They could hear muffled talking.  That was the thugs main hideout. They took sideways,  and stopped just beside the door.<br/>Fred lifted his hand, raised his finger. Signaling for countdown to burst in. He mouthed silently<br/>1… 2… 3…<br/>They burst in.<br/>“DON’T MOVE OR I’LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF!” Fred roared.<br/>The thugs inside froze instantly, shocked by the sudden ambush.<br/>They had no time to react. Serena and all her guards were already surrounding them, guns pointed from every angle.<br/>The thugs stared wide-eyed, They were trapped.<br/>Some of the thugs were armed, gripping their guns like they wanted to fight back. Fred pointed his weapon at them sharply and barked:<br/>“Drop your guns! If any of you act funny, you’ll be dead even before pulling the trigger.”<br/>They looked at each, clearly not wanting to obey. Then a voice chimed in. <br/>“Drop it.”<br/>A man stepped forward from the middle of the Gang. The thugs obeyed instantly. They dropped their guns one by one.<br/>Serena’s eyes narrowed.<br/>She recognized him.<br/>Charles did too.<br/>He was one of the three gunmen who attacked them last night.<br/>Serena stepped forward, and pointed a gun at him.<br/>“Where are the other two?”<br/>The leader grinned, “Nice meeting you again,” he said.<br/>“Shut up your mouth and answer my question,” Serena snapped. “Or I will blow your head off right here. Where are the other two?”<br/>The thug leader’s smirk widened.<br/>And right then, Charles felt something wasn’t right.</div>
