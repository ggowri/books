        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div>Norman’s breath hitched the moment he cracked the door open.<br/>It really was them.<br/>Lizzypie and Natasha stood in the corridor wearing almost nothing at all. Lizzypie had on a black silk slip so short it barely skimmed the tops of her thighs.<br/>Natasha wore a crimson lace bralette and matching micro-shorts skirt also.<br/>Norman’s cock jerked hard against the inside of his silk pajama pants.<br/>Lizzypie lifted her chin. “We will do whatever you want,” she said, voice low and steady. “Anything. Just give us the proof that clears Charles’s name.”<br/>Norman’s grin spread slowly  “I swear on my life I have it. Real proof. Undeniable. You two just have to… earn it.”<br/>Natasha’s eyes flicked down to his trouser.  She stepped forward “Then let’s go inside.”<br/>Norman swung the door wide, as they both walked in.<br/>He turned to face them, arms folded, . “You sure you’re not playing me… because I already have security on standby, and..”<br/>He didn’t get to finish.<br/>Lizzypie closed the distance in two strides, grabbed the front of his robe, yanked him down, and kissed him hard.<br/>Norman groaned into her mouth, as Lizzypie could even swallow his lips. <br/>She broke the kiss then whispered, “Shh. Let’s just get on with it.”<br/>Natasha moved in behind him. He felt her palms slide over his shoulders, down his chest, then lower. <br/>“Ughhh… fuck, yeah,” Norman hissed.<br/>*****<br/>The following week moved like a storm. <br/>Charles’ case, which should have taken months to build, was pushed to trial in just days. <br/>Prosecutors rushed everything with unnatural speed, saying they had brutal evidence.  Everyone was still called a murderer and it was the city's hot topic. <br/>Meanwhile, Serena became the nation’s favorite target. Everywhere she went, people whispered the same insult in front of her front. <br/>“Murderer-lover.”<br/>“Accomplice.”<br/>“Sympathizer.”<br/>Some people even spray-painted a huge graffiti across the Moretti headquarters:<br/>SHE LOVES A KILLER.<br/>Also, there were many of them in the company also.<br/>Still, Serena refused to make any public statement and stood on her ground that since Charles said no, she would believe him.<br/>One day, Mr. Moretti snapped in front of the board members, his voice echoing through the room.<br/>“Fine. If she prefers a criminal over her own family—She is OUT.” She was removed In her position,  and also for damage control, the Moretti family made a public announcement that they don't support whatever Serena was saying and how they had removed her.<br/> Also, she was escorted out of the mansion.<br/>“Go stay somewhere else until you get your senses back,” her father ordered coldly.<br/>Collins was the happiest person alive, he didn’t even bother pretending because behind every headline, and those graffiti painters was Collins deed.<br/>Collins was paying the media to keep the fire alive.<br/>He wanted  Serena gone. And his plan  worked perfectly.<br/>***<br/>This morning—Charles’ trial was finally starting.<br/>Cameras swarmed the courthouse like bees and the reporters were everywhere. This made Charles scoff. Everyone knew Mr. Eden wasn't a good person. He was a mafia leader and they were acting like he was a saint and made a very big deal out of it.<br/>The trial was live for everyone to see. In fact, Wilson wanted it to be publicized everywhere. Collins wanted the same. These two agendas collided — and that was what made this so big. <br/>Serena sat among the crowd in court, her heart pounding fast. If things went wrong, it would be over for her <br/>“Look at her,” someone whispered. “The wife of a murderer.”<br/>“They should just sentence him to death already,” another voice hissed.<br/>Soon after, the trial began. The judge took his seat, and the prosecutor stood up to present the case.<br/>All evidence pointed to Charles — his fingerprints were everywhere, and the video footage showed his actions before the murder. It was all clear enough to send him to prison for life.<br/>Wilson, among the crowd, was crying loudly. “Kill that bastard! He dared to be my precious father! Jail him!” He sobbed uncontrollably.<br/>The undeniable evidence they got was a recording during the killing, and it clearly brought out Charles’ voice. Charles scoffed because that was fabricated<br/>The  judge asked, “Attorney, do you have anything to say?”<br/>lizzypie was the one representing him. She stood up.<br/>Wilson shouted again, “What does that murderer have to say? Just jail him already!”<br/>Lizzypie turned to face him. “Well, maybe we should all hear this first .. and see who should really be jailed.”<br/>She brought out a recorder and pressed play.<br/>Two distinct voices came through the speakers, and everyone in the courtroom fell silent.<br/>On the recording:<br/>Mr. Eden: “What are you doing with the knife? Put that down!”<br/>Wilson: “Father! You betrayed me! I’m your only son, yet you chose him over me! I’m going to kill you!”<br/>Mr. Eden: “Wait—”<br/>Then came the sound, shrrr, shrrr,  of someone being stabbed.<br/>Wilson: “Die! Father, die!”<br/>The recorder stopped. The entire courtroom erupted into chaos.<br/>“What the hell was that?” someone gasped. “Isn’t that Wilson? He killed his father?”<br/>“He was all over the media crying for justice for his father — and he’s the killer? No way, I can’t believe this!”<br/>The judge, visibly shocked, leaned forward. “Can you tell us who the two people in this recording are?”<br/>Lizzypie replied calmly, “That’s Wilson, the deceased and Mr. Eden, his son.”<br/>Wilson jumped up. “What the hell are you saying? You’re trying to frame me! How would I kill my father and then drag you to court? She is fabricating things!”<br/>“But that’s undeniably your voice in the recording,” Lizzypie pointed out.<br/>“So what? You fabricated it! It’s simple these days…. with AI, anyone can fake voices! Yes, that’s my voice, but it’s not me! Let her bring proof to back it up!” Wilson yelled.<br/>The prosecutor shot to his feet, voice ringing through the courtroom.<br/>“My lord, this evidence should not be admissible,” he declared. “They sat on it until now. We already have a verified recording of the suspect during the killing—and suddenly they bring another recording? It creates two different versions of the crime scene.”<br/>The courtroom erupted in confused murmurs.<br/>The prosecutor continued confidently, “I have already authenticated my recording. It is genuine. So whatever they are presenting now…” he gave a dismissive laugh, “…is clearly fabricated.”<br/>People in the gallery nodded, whispering in agreement.<br/>“Exactly. Two recordings? Impossible.”<br/>“One of them has to be fake.”<br/>And because the prosecutor claimed his version came directly from an official source, complete with documentation and signature.<br/>Everyone automatically assumed Charles and Lizzypie were the ones lying.</div>
