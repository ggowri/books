        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div><p>As the thug leader kept grinning, it made Charles even more uneasy. </p><p>Serena’s patience snapped thin. Her hand hovered over the trigger, her eyes sharp and cold.</p><p>“Don’t test my patience,” she warned. “Where are your two others?”</p><p>The thug leader chuckled under his breath, enjoying every second.</p><p>“Well… they’re up there.”</p><p>Serena frowned and followed his gaze upward.</p><p>Her heart dropped.</p><p>On the unfinished upper floor, several men were slowly rising from behind the concrete edges, thugs who had been hiding there. One by one they stood, revealing themselves, and their number kept growing, more and more heads appearing.</p><p>There were too many.</p><p>Triple the number of Serena’s team, maybe even more.</p><p>Before anyone could react, another group , at least twenty  stormed in through the side entrance, surrounding Serena, Charles, and the guards in a tight circle.</p><p>Dozens of guns were suddenly pointed at them from every angle.</p><p>The leader smirked deeply.</p><p>“You think it would be that easy to get us?”</p><p>Behind him, the thugs who had earlier dropped their guns bent down and picked them back up, aiming directly at Serena’s team.</p><p>Charles turned around slowly, scanning every corner. They were surrounded completely. No exit and no blind spots.</p><p>Serena’s eyes reddened with fury as she realized they had walked right into a trap.</p><p>The thug leader stepped forward.</p><p>“I don’t think I have to talk more. Tell your people to drop their guns. Now.”</p><p>Serena’s voice shook with rage.“You… you knew we were coming? How?… someone informed you!”</p><p>The leader’s face darkened.“I don’t ask you to talk. Drop your guns,  you and your men!!”</p><p>With the sound of dozens of triggers shifting and guns tightening their aim, Serena slowly raised her hands. </p><p>Her chest rose and fell sharply as she tried to calm her voice.</p><p>“Okay… okay,” she said quietly.</p><p>Then she let her gun drop to the ground.</p><p>She motioned to her guards, and one by one, they followed, dropping their weapons reluctantly. The metal clattered across the concrete.</p><p>Just then, two more figures stepped forward from behind the crowd, the other two gunmen who attacked them last night.</p><p>One of them grinned.“Beauty, you are stupid for even thinking of coming here. You just made killing you easy for us. But don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll make you have a good time before you die...&quot; He licked his lips obscenely.</p><p>The other tall thugs also burst into laughter.</p><p>The first leader stepped forward again, his voice calm and cruel.“Move the others to another room. Kill them all there.”</p><p>Serena’s eyes widened.</p><p>“What the hell are you saying? They aren’t your target! Let the others go!”</p><p>He looked at her, genuinely amused. &quot;Sentimental and stupid. You led them here. Their blood is on your hands.&quot;</p><p>He pointed at another thug. “Hey! Move them to the pit. You can bury them alive there to save ammunition .”</p><p>Several thugs lifted their guns again and shoved the muzzles into Fred and the guards’ backs.</p><p>“MOVE IT!!” one shouted.</p><p>Serena spat, her voice sharp and clear“DON’T kill them! Take me!  Your problem is with me. So be a man and face me alone.”</p><p>But they don&#x27;t listen.</p><p>One by one, Serena’s guards, including Fred were pushed out forcefully, guns pointed at their necks, forced down the hallway toward an unfinished side of the building, toward the pit the thug leader mentioned. </p><p>Now, only Charles and Serena remained in the room. </p><p> &quot;You touch one hair on their heads,&quot; she declared, her gaze burning into the leader, &quot;and I will personally ensure you die screaming. You think this is a threat? It&#x27;s a prophecy.&quot;</p><p>The leader laughed loudly.</p><p>“Haha! And how will you do that when you’re going to die too? You are too arrogant. That’s exactly why he said we should kill you off. He was right about you.”</p><p>“Who?&quot; Serena’s face twitched.“Who is he? Tell me!”</p><p>The leader chuckled and shook his head.“No need to know. You are dying anyway. I will kill you now, send your head to him, and get our final payment.”</p><p>He motioned to his gang.</p><p>In one instant, nearly fifty thugs raised their guns, all aiming at Serena and Charles.</p><p>Then the leader smirked at Charles.</p><p>“You seem tough… last time you dodged our bullets. Let’s see how you dodge all this now.”</p><p>He lifted his hand, about to give the kill order.</p><p>[Eyes of Satan Activated].</p><p>Charles disappeared from his spot instantly.</p><p>In one blur of movement, faster than a blink, he dashed straight toward the leader, snatched the gun from his hand, and pointed it right at his forehead.</p><p>He was so fast the thugs didn’t even see him move.Gasps filled the room.</p><p>The leader froze, eyes trembling.</p><p>Charles muttered coldly,</p><p>“Order your men to drop their guns… or I will put a hole in your head.”</p><p>The two other gunmen shouted in panic:</p><p>“Brother!!”</p><p>The entire fifty-man group raised their guns higher, fingers on triggers, aiming straight at Charles.</p><p>The leader scoffed with a tight, angry smile.</p><p>“You must be stupid. What do you think will happen if you kill me? They will shoot you instantly. You will die too.”</p><p>Charles said calmly,</p><p>“At least you will be dead with me. That’s a win-win.”</p><p>The leader clicked his tongue.</p><p>“You know, I like your guts. Just drop the gun and I will spare you. I will kill only this bitch,” he pointed at Serena, “and you can work for me.”</p><p>Charles didn’t blink.</p><p>“I’m not here to negotiate. Order your men to put their guns down. We will die anyway, so I don’t care if they kill me after I kill you.”</p><p>The leader’s expression hardened, eyes filled with anger.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the far, far top corner of the room, nearly invisible in the shadows of the unfinished beams, a sniper lay flat, aiming directly at Charles.</p><p>Serena noticed one of the gunmen shifting his eyes toward the far corner. She followed his glance, turning her head slightly.</p><p>And she saw it. A sniper.</p><p>The leader  smirked.</p><p>“You are stupid for refusing my offer. Now you die.”</p><p>He signaled subtly to the sniper.</p><p>Serena screamed:</p><p>“CHARLES!!!”</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>A single gunshot thundered through the whole building.</p><p>Blood splashed.</p><p>Charles’ eyes widened as hot blood sprayed across his face.</p><p>The entire room froze.</p><p>It wasn’t Charles who got shot.</p><p>It was Serena…who threw herself forward and took the bullet for him.</p></div>
