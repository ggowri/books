        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div><p>Derek began to pray for it all to be over quickly. He even wished that Tiger would just throw out Charles and Tracy’s bodies in the next second, so he could regretfully say he had done his best, and it was just that the two of them hadn’t lasted long enough.</p><p>LizzyPie scoffed and said, “We didn’t even hear what your father was saying, but you expect us to believe the nonsense you just did?”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey chimed in, “I don’t think Derek would lie about something like that. That would be pathetic and low of him. He could never do that.”</p><p>Derek smiled smugly and said, “Why would I lie?”</p><p>LizzyPie then turned to Serena. “If you really want to save your fiancé, you should find a way to call the Godfather. You can’t just believe what this one is saying.”</p><p>Serena thought about it. She believed there was no way they could contact the Godfather, but she also knew she had to do something. So she decided to call her father.</p><p>Meanwhile, back inside the room, Charles was still pinned down as two bodyguards came in. They both had the same height, with cold, killer faces like something out of The Matrix, wearing dark glasses.</p><p>Tiger burst into laughter. “Ahh, you are dead today. Noxon and Scorpion are here!”, then he ordered them with a wicked grin. “Pin this motherfucker down and make him watch how I will fuck his lover.”</p><p>Noxon and Scorpion obeyed immediately, forcing Charles to the ground, while the other guards stepped aside to give space.</p><p>“Yes!” Tiger sneered, his voice dripping with cruelty. “I will make sure you wish for death when I am done with you. First… let’s go on with this.”</p><p>He reached toward Tracy, his hands trembling with vile, sex-hungry desire, trying to strip her. His hands cupped her full breasts, the pale flesh overflowing his fingers as he kneaded them roughly.</p><p>Tracy screamed and struggled, trying to break free. “No… get away! Charles, help me, please!”</p><p>Charles’s chest heaved. He could see her struggling, and he couldn’t even bear to look anymore. He shut his eyes deep, every vein on his face tightening. And then his eyeballs split into two glowing slits.</p><p>[Eye of Satan Activated — Level 2]</p><p>The X-ray eyes blazed on him, and a surge of power flooded through his body. He felt stronger, unstoppable. With a violent roar, Charles flung Noxon and Scorpion off him like they were nothing.</p><p>He leapt to his feet, stormed toward Tiger, and delivered a crushing punch that sent the man flying backward.</p><p>Tiger crashed into the wall, coughing blood. His eyes widened in disbelief. “What the fuck! What are you waiting for, you two? Kill him!” </p><p>Noxon cracked his neck, Scorpion flexed his knuckles. Both moved in unison, like shadows with muscle, and they charged at him. </p><p>Charles barely ducked a flying kick from Scorpion that shattered a lamp and sent sparks across the room. He countered with a heavy punch to Noxon’s chest, sending him crashing into a wooden table. The table collapsed into splinters, but Noxon sprang back as if nothing had touched him. They were so strong. Even though he was faster than them, they were fighting like a beast.</p><p>Scorpion swept low, Charles jumped, but midair Noxon caught him by the throat and slammed him against the wall. Plaster rained down. Charles roared, smashing his elbow into Noxon’s jaw. The man only grinned, wiping blood from his lip like it was nothing.</p><p>Charles spun, kicking Scorpion into a shelf. Bottles and glasses shattered, liquor spilling across the floor like blood. He lunged to follow up, but Noxon was already there—an iron fist in his stomach, knocking the breath out of him. Charles staggered, gasping, his X-ray vision flickering uselessly. They were too fast also and too coordinated. His gift couldn’t predict them.</p><p>That was when he saw their eyes, it turned to blue! They had super power also.</p><p>He was heaving very hard, gasping for air. He didn&#x27;t even rest before they charged at him again, he managed to dodge it, and then threw himself to them, making them crash hard on the floor.</p><p>Thud!  </p><p> Everywhere was in chaos.</p><p>But Scorpion was already up. His kick hit Charles’s side like a sledgehammer. The blow launched him across the room, flipping over the broken table. He landed hard, the air punched out of his lungs.</p><p>They came together now, like wolves. Charles blocked, ducked, but there were all over him, fists hammered his face, boots crushed his ribs. Blood spattered the floor. Finally, a brutal hook from Noxon sent Charles sprawling. He tried to rise, body trembling, but Scorpion stomped him down, boot pressing into his chest. Charles gasped, arms straining, but his strength was gone.  He couldn’t stand up again.</p><p>Tiger stepped forward, slow and triumphant, pulling his gun from his belt. He aimed at Charles’s head, smiling cruelly.</p><p>“You fought harder than I expected. But no man defies Tiger and his son and wins. You will die here, and your lover will watch.”</p><p>Charles glared up at him, blood dripping into his eyes. Tiger cocked the gun.</p><p>“Oh no… please… Please, don’t kill him!” Tracy cried and started ranting, “oh Charles, I’m sorry for everything I did. You should know it was all a misunderstanding, but I shouldn’t have acted cold to you. Please forgive me”. Seriously crying, seeing the moment as final. As Tiger was very keen in killing him.</p><p>“Die! you motherfucker!”, his hand hovering on the trigger.</p><p>Just then, a voice was a thunderclap, shaking the air.</p><p>“Bow! The Godfather had arrived!”</p><p>Every guard froze. Noxon and Scorpion stiffened, their boots retreating from Charles. Even Tiger’s hand trembled on the trigger, eyes widening.</p><p></p></div>
