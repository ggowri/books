        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div><p>Serena and Charles stopped just outside the room.</p><p>Charles turned to her. “Why did you do that?” His voice was low but strained. “Why would you risk everything and refuse to break the engagement?”</p><p>Serena crossed her arms. “Why would you even agree to it?” she shot back.</p><p>He frowned. “Because it’s fake. Our relationship is fake. I thought it wouldn’t matter. I didn’t want my problems affecting you.”</p><p>She swallowed. For a moment she didn’t answer. That was the problem. Even she wasn’t sure anymore. Why would she do that? </p><p>Finally she said, quieter, “Because what they are doing isn’t right. I can’t stand it. I just can’t.”</p><p>Charles sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “So what do we do now?”</p><p>She straightened as if she had already decided. “You tell the truth about what happened that day. To the media and to the public.”</p><p>He blinked. “That&#x27;s it?”</p><p>“Yeah, all we have to do is make a big drama out of it. They will  take me back in,” she said firmly. </p><p>He hesitated. “And if Collins succeeds? You will  lose everything. Your position as the CEO. The project.”</p><p>She exhaled slowly. That was the real fear. But she kept her voice steady. “Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.”</p><p>He studied her for a long second. Then he stepped closer and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>Serena stiffened in surprise. “W-What are you doing?”</p><p>“Comforting you of course,” he said simply.</p><p>Then she felt it. A hard thing choking her between her skirts. She jolted back. “Hey.”</p><p>Charles froze. He looked down, realization hitting him hard, his dick uncontrollably hardened. His ears burned. “Uh… I… am sorry.”</p><p>She scoffed, half annoyed, half flustered. “At least book a hotel if you’re going to do that. I’ll be ready.”</p><p>His throat went dry. Again. She was proposing sex again. </p><p>He lifted his hands quickly. “No. No. That is not what I was thinking.” because he hadn&#x27;t levelled up the stage he was in. </p><p>Her expression darkened. Silence stretched between them.</p><p>“Okay,” she said flatly. “Bye.”</p><p>She turned and started walking away.</p><p>“Wait,” Charles called. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“I will book an apartment and live there for now,” she replied without turning back.</p><p>He smiled faintly and raised a hand. “Alright. See you.”</p><p>She didn’t look back. She just kept walking.</p><p>And Charles stood there watching her go, wondering when a fake relationship had started feeling this real. </p><p>Charles returned to the hotel apartment late that night.</p><p>LizzyPie was on the couch with her laptop open, screen glowing against her face. Her fingers paused when she noticed him.</p><p>“How are Sapphire and the girls?” he asked.</p><p>“They are fine,” LizzyPie said. “I already booked a room for them. They are inside resting.”</p><p>He nodded. “Thanks so much. I will check on them later.”</p><p>He sat beside her and gently took her hand. “Lizzy, can you tell me what’s been going on with you lately? You seem like you are dealing with something alone.  You don’t have to. You can tell me”</p><p>She looked at him for a moment, then smiled softly. She leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. “It’s nothing. I can handle it on my own. You don’t need to worry.”</p><p>“You always say that,” Charles replied. “But you always look worried.”</p><p>“When it is time, I will tell you,” she said quietly. “I swear it’s nothing you should lose sleep over.”</p><p>He studied her face, then decided to let it go.</p><p>His eyes drifted to the laptop screen. Lines of names and documents were open. One name stood out.</p><p>“Damien,” Charles said. “Have you found anything? Anything we can use to drag him down?”</p><p>LizzyPie exhaled and leaned back. “A lot. Money laundering. Arms deals. Human trafficking through shell companies. Political blackmail. Mr. Damien is like a mafia lord.”</p><p>Charles stiffened. “Then why is he still standing? let us publish all this.”</p><p>“That won&#x27;t do anything, ” she said calmly. “He is too influential and too protected. Even if we expose everything, nothing happens unless the Godfather steps in and tells the president himself.”</p><p>“And he won’t,” Charles said quietly. “He already said he won&#x27;t assist.”</p><p>Charles swallowed. “So what do we do?”</p><p>LizzyPie closed the laptop slowly. “We deal with him ourselves. Maybe we kill him first”</p><p>He looked at her sharply.</p><p>“If Damien falls,” she continued, her voice steady, “Cheng Enterprises loses its backbone.  Power will shift with some internal crises, and we will attack them.”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly in agreement.  “Then the problem is how we would kill him”.</p><p>Lizzypie nodded. They spent almost all the night strategizing until they fell asleep on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>××××</p><p>[The next morning]</p><p>Ding. Ding. Ding</p><p>The sound cut through his sleep.</p><p>Charles jerked awake, his phone vibrating against the glass table. He blinked and turned his head. LizzyPie was still asleep beside him, curled on the sofa.</p><p>He grabbed the phone.</p><p>As Natasha lit up.</p><p>He answered quickly. “Hello?”</p><p>“Charles,” Natasha said. Her voice was tight. “Where are you right now?”</p><p>“I am at home?. What’s wrong?”</p><p>“We need to meet. Now,” she said. “I found more information about your father. You have to see this.”</p><p>His chest tightened. “What kind of information?”</p><p>“I can’t say it over the phone,” she replied. “But it’s serious.”</p><p>Charles sat up fully. “Okay. Okay. I am on my way.”</p><p>“Okay, you meet me at my store!”Natasha said.</p><p>“OKAY.” Charles replied then hung up.</p><p>He lowered the phone slowly and looked back at LizzyPie. She hadn’t moved. Must be seriously tired.</p><p>Carefully, he stood and lifted her into his arms. She stirred slightly but didn’t wake. He carried her into her room, laid her on the bed, and pulled a blanket over her.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her forehead gently.</p><p>Then he straightened, grabbed his jacket, and walked out.</p><p>As he headed toward the elevator, his mind raced. He wondered what Natasha had found for her to sound that shock. </p></div>
