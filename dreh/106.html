        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div><p>Derek was already closing up to her. Mrs. Hailey was worried what if people see them.</p><p>“This is dangerous, we will fuck each other when we reach home.”</p><p>Derek sneered, “No, you arouse me. Where are you so fucking beautiful at your 50’s, your outfit is sexy. It makes me horny, no one will come here. It&#x27;s an abandoned washroom.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey smirked, looked around before she yanked her dress up, panties sliding down her thighs. Derek shoved her against the bathtub edge.</p><p> She bent over, hands gripping the edge, tits spilling from her bra as he ripped it open.</p><p>Derek cock sprang free, hard and thick. He grabbed her hips, rubbing the head against her wet pussy.</p><p> “I will be quick,” he growled. She moaned, pushing back as he thrust in deep, filling her tight pussy with one stroke.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey gasped, tits bouncing as he pounded her. The bathtub rim dug into her belly, but she didn’t care.</p><p> Derek’s hands squeezed her tits, pinching nipples hard.</p><p> “Fuck me,” she hissed. He slammed faster, cock stretching her pussy, wet slaps echoing in the small room.</p><p>She coiled, her pussy clenching around his cock. He grunted, driving deeper, balls slapping her skin. Her tits swung wildly, nipples brushing the tub.</p><p> “Harder,” she begged. Derek gripped her hair, yanking her head back, fucking her rough and fast.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s moans grew louder, but Derek closed her mouth. His cock throbbed inside her, hitting every spot. </p><p>Meanwhile, downstairs, Tracy was just watching Serena and Charles take the glory, she was so mad because of this and she noticed her mom and Derek were nowhere to be found. </p><p>She looked around as she searched for them, but still she couldn&#x27;t see them. Then she asked her casual friend who told her that she saw her mom going to the washroom.</p><p>She wanted to ignore it, but she was concerned about how late she was, and where Derek was.</p><p>So, she made her way to the washroom. Upon arriving, she saw no one. She looked around carefully, but the space was empty.</p><p>&quot;Where the hell could she be?&quot; she muttered to herself. She turned to leave when her eyes caught sight of the washroom door. Tagged on it were the words: &quot;Stay away, under construction.&quot;</p><p>From inside, she thought she heard faint voices.</p><p>&quot;Could my mom be in there?&quot; she murmured hesitantly. Despite the warning, she decided to enter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Hailey and Derek were still in the dirty lust. Derek pulled out, slick cock nudging her tight anal hole. Mrs. Hailey gasped as he pushed in slowly, stretching her. He grabbed her hanging tits, squeezing hard, and thrust deep. She whimpered, pussy dripping, ass clenching his cock. He pounded her anal hole, tits bouncing in his rough grip.</p><p>“Mom, are you there?” Tracy’s voice echoed outside.</p><p>They froze. Derek’s cock throbbed inside her ass, as they both popped out their eyes.</p><p>“Is that Tracy?” Mrs. Hailey whispered, panic rushing back.</p><p>Derek cursed under his breath. “Damn it. She’s coming.”</p><p>“I told you we shouldn’t have come here,” Mrs. Hailey hissed. “What if she sees us?”</p><p>“This isn’t the time to argue,” Derek muttered. “What should we do now?, she knows you are here!”</p><p>Outside, Tracy’s footsteps grew louder.</p><p>“Mom? I can hear your voice,” she called. “Why are you in there?”</p><p>No answer. Only the faint sound of shuffling.</p><p>“Mom, I’m serious. I’m coming in,” she said, hand already on the handle.</p><p>The door creaked open. Tracy stepped inside.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey and Derek stood side by side near the sink, both looking startled and flushed, trying to appear calm.</p><p>They were already dressed. Their clothes were straightened, but something about their faces nervous, guilty, breathless, made Tracy’s stomach twist.</p><p>She frowned. “Mom? Derek? What… What are you two doing here together?”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey forced a laugh, her voice trembling. “Oh, sweetheart, nothing. I just needed some air. Derek came to check if I was okay.”</p><p>But Tracy didn’t buy it. Her eyes moved between them, their awkward distance and their uneven breathing. Something was wrong. She could feel it.</p><p>Here’s a continuation that keeps your story </p><p>Tracy’s voice cut through the silence. “You came to check on my mom in an abandoned washroom? Inside the same stall? I don’t buy it.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “What are you both really doing?”</p><p>Derek’s pulse kicked hard. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. Mrs. Hailey looked from him to Tracy, panic rising.</p><p>“Tracy, calm down—” she began.</p><p>“No!” Tracy’s voice cracked. “Mom, Derek, what the hell is going on between you two? Don’t tell me you’re—”</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Derek interrupted, lifting his hands. “I will tell you.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey turned sharply toward him, eyes wide. What is he doing?</p><p>“Better,” Tracy snapped. “Start talking.”</p><p>Derek took a deep breath. “We were trying to keep it from you because we knew you’d take it the wrong way,” he said quickly. “But fine—here’s the truth. We’re here because we’re planning to take Charles down tonight.”</p><p>Tracy blinked. “What?”</p><p>“We are going to destroy him,” Derek said, his voice low but firm. “By releasing his cheating Sex tape”</p><p>Tracy’s eyes widened. “What sex tape? With who?”</p><p>Derek smirked, a predatory gleam in his eyes. &quot;Yeah. I caught him with that stone-trader bitch. I&#x27;ve got a crystal-clear recording of them fucking. We&#x27;re releasing it tonight.&quot; His voice dripped with vicious satisfaction. &quot;It&#x27;ll destroy them both. With a scandal like that, the award committee wouldn&#x27;t touch them with a ten-foot pole.&quot;</p><p>Mrs. Hailey was quick to nod in agreement. &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s what we came to discuss. We knew you&#x27;d never agree, Tracy, so we decided not to tell you.&quot; She offered a weak, forced smile. &quot;But you found us anyway.&quot;</p><p>Tracy&#x27;s heart slammed against her ribs. </p><p>Destroy him completely? Her mind raced. If that video got out, Charles&#x27;s reputation would be shattered beyond repair. Was she really ready to burn his entire world to the ground?</p><p>But then, the bitter memories surged forward. He had ruined her first. He stole the honor that was rightfully hers. He was the one who broke his vows, who abandoned her to become Serena&#x27;s lapdog, only to tangle himself with another woman. He was in the wrong... And this would humiliate Serena, that self-righteous princess, in the process.</p><p>She swallowed hard, the conflict a tight knot in her throat. </p><p>&quot;Where is the video?&quot; she asked, her voice trembling.</p><p>Derek grinned, confidence returning. “Right here.” He pulled out his phone, tapping the screen before holding it up for her to see.</p></div>
