        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div><p>Serena sighed in disappointment. She didn’t even blame Charles — she blamed herself for believing him. What had she been thinking? He was a man with no background, no power, no connection. How could he have possibly met Mr. Vasilios?</p><p>Mr. Moretti leaned back in his chair and said coldly, “I hope you still remember the consequences of losing this bet, just as you promised.”</p><p>Allison sneered, resting her elbows on the table. “I think this should make Serena automatically become Norman’s wife. Only Norman can help us with this issue — not this useless piece of garbage.”</p><p>Collins smirked. “Yeah, a useless pauper thinking he could marry into our family. You thought you’d made it, didn’t you?”</p><p>Charles stepped forward, calm but firm. “Maybe you both can shut up and let me talk.”</p><p>Collins slammed the table. “What did you just say? How dare you raise your voice here to me!” He stood, fury in his eyes. </p><p>Allison snapped, “You still have the guts to talk?”.</p><p>Then Charles brought out the signed document. “This is it,” he said firmly. “I made Mr. Vasilios sign the deal. He’ll stop disturbing you — and you won’t have to pay any dues to him again!”</p><p>The whole table went silent. Everyone froze, eyes narrowing as they looked at the paper in his hand.</p><p>Collins shot to his feet and snatched it from Charles. He flipped through it quickly, reading line by line. The color drained from his face — the document was clear. It stated that Mr. Vasilios would permanently stop collecting dues or charges from the Moretti family.</p><p>“This… this isn’t possible,” Collins stammered. His voice rose. “How could someone like you make Mr. Vasilios sign this?”</p><p>The family instantly crowded around, demanding to see it. The document was passed from hand to hand until it reached Mr. Moretti himself. He studied it carefully, eyes tracing every word, every signature.</p><p>“I know Mr. Vasilios’s signature,” he said slowly. “This is real. It’s clearly his.”</p><p>Collins shook his head violently. “No! It’s a lie! It’s fake — he forged it! There’s no way Vasilios would ever sign something like this for him!” He slammed his palm on the table. “It’s not possible!”</p><p>Allison leaned back, a small smirk forming. “This man is playing us,” she said. “There is absolutely no way he can do this. ”</p><p>Murmurs spread around the table. Some of the family whispered, “Could it be true? He really met Vasilios?”</p><p>“I can&#x27;t believe that this fuker is lying!”.</p><p>Collins’ face flushed red with anger and disbelief, his hands trembling as he pointed at Charles. “You… you tricked us somehow! I swear if this paper is truth, you are free to smack me!”</p><p>Serena, still in shock and barely believing what she was seeing, stood up. “This is unbelievable… truly. But I think we can confirm it by calling Mr. Vasilios himself.”</p><p>Everyone looked at one another — she was right, that was the only way to be sure. But no one there had Mr. Vasilios’s number.</p><p>Collins scoffed. “Mr. Vasilios is such a powerful man, even we can’t get his number — let alone this nobody standing here.”</p><p>Charles smirked and said calmly, “Well, I have his contact.”</p><p>“What!. He even got the number!”Allison couldn&#x27;t help but yell. Charles kept shocking them.</p><p>Collins laughed it off, “This guy is playing us, even Mr. Moretti here couldn&#x27;t even get his number. But you think someone like you will even get the chance?”</p><p>Charles pulled out his phone, the room holding its breath. “Fine,” he said, calm and sure. “Let’s confirm it right now.”</p><p>Everyone stared, stunned as he scrolled through his contacts, pressed a button, and raised the phone to his ear. The silence was heavy — only the faint ringing sound filled the dining room.</p><p>Then a voice came through.</p><p>Charles turned the phone toward Mr. Moretti. “Here, sir. You can speak with him yourself.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti hesitated, eyes wide, and slowly took the phone. “H-Hello? Mr. Vasilios?”</p><p>“Ah, hello, Mr. Charles!” the voice answered warmly from the other end.</p><p>Mr. Moretti froze. That voice — he knew it. His expression changed instantly. </p><p>“It’s me… Mr. Moretti,” he said, stunned.</p><p>“Oh! Mr. Moretti,” Vasilios replied cheerfully. “You’ve got yourself a good and capable son-in-law. He surprised me today. Because of him, I’ve stopped collecting any fees from your company. I already gave him the signed document.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti blinked rapidly, trying to steady his voice. “Oh… oh, okay, sir. I’m very grateful.”</p><p>Vasilios continued, “Just hold on to him — he’s a good one. We will talk more when we meet. Bye for now.”</p><p>The call ended.</p><p>The room stayed silent for a long moment. Mr. Moretti lowered the phone slowly, eyes still fixed on Charles. His lips parted, disbelief and admiration mixing in his expression.</p><p>“That was really Mr. Vasilios,” he said at last, his voice trembling slightly. “This young man… has done what even I could never do.” He stood up, looking around the table. “From today, I&#x27;m officially making him my son-in-law. Let’s pick a wedding date!”</p></div>
