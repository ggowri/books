        <h1>Chapter 19.</h1>
        <div>Charles watched the line, then replied to Tracy herself, “Yes. I’m the important guest.”<br/>Tracy’s lips just met his, and they watched as Charles took the elevator and made his way up.<br/>Derek also stood there, shifting uneasily. He nodded his head. “Mmm, what’s going on here? How is it possible for him to be here as an important guest?”<br/>Tracy scoffed. “I have known him for five years, and all these years, I have been feeding him. He is poor and I’m so sure he’s here as a server. You know he does hotel services.”<br/>Derek nodded in agreement, still in denial that Charles was the important guest.<br/>“Oh yes. The guards must have mistaken him. He’s going upstairs to serve them.”<br/>Tracy added, “He’s doing everything to make me feel bad. I can’t wait for the day he sees how stupid he is and comes back for me.”<br/>Derek rolled his fists hearing this. It was very clear Tracy wasn’t over Charles yet.<br/>Meanwhile, Charles arrived at the upper floor and was guided to room 0001. As he stepped in, it felt like paradise. This was the most spacious room he had ever seen.<br/>It was well lit, and almost everything was made of gold and silver.<br/>There were three people in the room. Two stood on the left and right beside a man. They had some weird tattoos and held rifles. Charles gulped.<br/>Then the man stood up, smocking thick tobacco.<br/>Charles’s eyes went wide. The man before him was huge, like a mountain…broad shoulders, thick arms, veins popping out. His face was rough and scary, with scars and a hardened look. His eyes were sharp.<br/> Charles felt his legs tremble. He felt like he was facing a beast.<br/>The man smiled slowly. “Finally, you are here,” he said, his voice deep and dangerous.<br/>Charles gulped. “Y-you… you are the Godfather?” he stammered, his voice shaking.<br/>The man nodded. “Yes. I am the one. The mafia lord of the Black Shadow Syndicate.”<br/>At those words, Charles’s knees nearly buckled. He had heard about them.  Everyone in the city knows them. <br/>The Black Shadow Syndicate wasn’t just powerful; they were untouchable. Their influence seeped through governments, corporations, even law enforcement. People whispered that the Godfather held more power than the president himself. And now this figure was looking for him? Ordinary him. He concluded they were here to harvest his kidney.<br/>Charles should have been terrified, but he had nothing left to lose, so he remained calm. “You called for me?”<br/>The man’s eyes glinted. “Yes. My original name is Vincent Wilson. Your grandfather.”<br/>Charles froze. His grandfather? He couldn’t believe it.<br/>He had been an orphan for a very long time. He didn’t even know his parents, and now this man stood here claiming to be his grandfather.<br/>Was this a prank that Tracy was doing? Maybe she wanted to mock him.<br/>He looked around for a camera. But who in their right mind would prank someone in room 0001 of the Royal Grand hotel?.<br/>He coughed and said, “I don’t remember having parents, let alone a grandfather. Please, what’s the reason you called me here?”<br/>“Okay, you want proof then?” the man asked.<br/>“Yes. You said you are the mafia lord of the Black Shadow Syndicate. Do you even know how powerful the man was? And you are saying you are my grandfather, when I’m just a nobody?”<br/>The man smiled, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then opened them again.<br/>When he did, he stared at Charles. Charles startled, because the pupils of the man had just split into two, like two in each eye.<br/>“You… you have it?” Charles was shocked. This wasn't his first time seeing it. The thing was phenomenal. He had it. He could do it too. <br/>“Yes. It’s called Satan Eyes, a supernatural power passed from one generation to another, only our bloodline has it. That’s what we use in ruling the empire,” the man said.<br/>Charles couldn’t believe what he was hearing.<br/>“This power always awakens during your first encounter with a woman. Once it does, you can use it. Show me yours,” the man asked.<br/>Charles closed his eyes deeply and opened them again. They split also, just like Mr. Vincent. It was barely noticeable, but it was there.<br/>He remembered after his first night with Tracy, he started noticing it.  <br/>He had thought maybe it was a medical issue and was planning to meet a doctor once he had money. He didn't tell anyone about it, not even Tracy.<br/>He later realized that since then, his eyes had turned sharp. That was why he nearly had no injuries during his firefighter missions. He dove into danger completely. That was also the reason he could beat Derek and his goons.<br/>And this man here had it too. This man was also the leader of the Black Shadow Syndicate. <br/>So this man really was his grandfather? And these eyes were something supernatural?.<br/>“What do these eyes do? What is it about?” He asked.<br/>“…Like I told you,” the man continued, his voice calm but heavy with authority, “it’s called Satan Eyes. It grants many abilities: visions, heightened perception, even glimpses of the future. But since yours is only Level One, you will mostly notice that your senses sharpen, and time slows around you in crucial moments. You will be able to dodge danger, anticipate attacks.”<br/>Vincent pulled out a half-pendant. Charles’s eyes widened. He had carried something like this since he was a child in the orphanage, always believing it was his lucky charm. Luckily, it was with him. He pulled it out, and the halves clicked together perfectly.<br/>Charles swallowed hard, disbelief overwhelming him. This man was right. He was his grandfather.<br/>Tears blurred his vision. For twenty-six years, he had been alone and suffered a lot. He had been looked down upon by many. In fact, he believed that was why Tracy cheated on him.<br/>Mr. Vincent stepped closer and wrapped him in a firm, reassuring hug. “I know you’ve suffered, Charles. I’m sorry I couldn’t find you sooner. You will inherit all my wealth and become the next Godfather.”<br/>Charles felt his breath catch and instantly forgot how to breathe.</div>
