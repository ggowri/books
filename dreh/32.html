        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div>It was true that Charles made the analysis, but he hadn’t even solved it yet; he was truly just bluffing because that would make this fake engagement a long-term plan. He confidently said, “You try me.”<br/>Serena stared at him for a moment. What Charles said was all true, and even her father was panicking. She had also been trying to find a way to make Mr. Vasilios powerless, all to no avail; but this man was saying he could do it. She didn’t believe him a bit, but she had nothing to lose either way. All it would take was a fake engagement for two months that would even benefit her.<br/>She scoffed and said, “If you really pull a solution I will undoubtedly fall in love with you, and we will get married, that's for sure… But I expect nothing from you anyway. I will accept the bet.” Charles smiled and was happy. With that, Serena took the ring and slid it down her finger. <br/>“I will take the ring as the symbol of our engagement.”<br/>Charles nodded. Then Serena brought out her phone, moved closer to him — in fact, so close she almost pressed her breasts against him  and displayed that finger with the ring.<br/>“Smile…” she said, and Charles put on a weak smile. SNAP! She took a picture of them, went back to her seat and started pressing her phone.<br/>“Uhm… what are you doing?” Charles curiously asked.<br/>“I am posting it on Instagram. Everyone has to know I am now engaged,” she said. Charles was shocked and said, “But Mr. Moretti hasn’t known about it yet, nor anyone in your family. What if they don’t like me and don’t like the idea of us? I think you should consult them first.”<br/>Serena scoffed it off and said, “You talk too much. I own my life and do whatever I want. They might not like you… they will definitely not and that will make it so hard for you. But they won’t stop you from being my fiancée; they won’t just easily accept you.”<br/>Charles sighed, because this just sounded like another trial. After that day, Serena told Charles that he should go home and pick up the rest of his luggage and then come back. As Charles made his way back to the hotel, he was very happy. He picked up his phone after it dinged; it was a friend request from Serena on Instagram. He eagerly accepted it and scrolled to her image. Her new post was their picture — the one she took.<br/>“Finally took the ring from the love of my life!” was the caption. Charles himself was amazed by this. He scrolled through the comments.<br/>“Ahhh, what the fuck! You are finally engaged, after I have texted you a thousand times.”“Who the hell is he? I bet his parents must be strikingly rich.”“I have to run information on this man as soon as possible!”<br/>There were many comments. Some were extremely angry that Charles took their woman; some were jealous; others were curious about who he was. Charles knew he was now currently the subject of some trouble. People wouldn’t leave him alone anymore.<br/>“I finished the first trial anyway, now grandfather can give part of his wealth!” he said, happy at that thought. With that wealth he could use it to maintain their relationship.<br/>As soon as he reached the hotel he went to the receptionist and showed them the gilded card. “I want to visit room 0001.”<br/>The receptionist said, “No one is in room 0001 at the moment.”<br/>Charles was confused and firmed his jaw. “What… 0001? Someone was in that room yesterday , I even visited the person the day before. What are you saying?”<br/>“We are sorry. We can’t disclose much about that room, but like I said, no one is in the room.”<br/>Hearing that, Charles immediately felt broken, with many thoughts running through his mind. “Am I being played? Fuck… maybe that old man wasn’t my grandfather and I was just being played. Oh no!” he cried out, because he had thought that would be his end of suffering.<br/>“Charles, right?” A very soft female voice came from behind. He swiftly turned; a lady was standing there with a faint smile.<br/>Charles couldn’t help but gasp at the tall but busty woman in front of him. She looked slim but had large breasts and long legs. Her hips were curvy. Charles couldn’t help but gasp: this woman was fucking pretty. Maybe not as pretty as Serena …because Serena’s beauty was more in her face and her perfect hourglass figure — but this woman had anime-manga features.<br/>“Uh… how can I help you? Yes, I’m Charles,” he said calmly.<br/>“Well, Mr. Vincent sent me here,” she said.<br/>“Oh, really… that’s good. I had started to think something unimaginable here. Let’s go where he is!” he said, eager to meet him.<br/>“We are not meeting him. He knew that you had finished the first trial, and he sent me here,” the lady said.<br/>Charles frowned. Serena posted the picture so Mr. Vincent must have seen it. He should be here to give him some part of the wealth, he was thinking, maybe ten percent, which would amount to thirty billion dollars. But he wasn’t here and this woman had come from him.<br/>He gulped, hoping it was not what he was thinking. “Uhm… if you are not here to take me to him, then why are you—?”<br/>The busty lady smiled, and instantly Charles could get the meaning. “The fuck! You are my reward. My reward for winning the first trial was you!” he thought, excited and amazed.</div>
