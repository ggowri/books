        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div>Everyone hurriedly left the hall to avoid becoming collateral damage when the Tiger Fangs arrived.<br/> Charles turned to Mr. Vasilios. “I’m sorry for the commotion.”<br/>Ms. Janet jumped in. “No,  what you did is highly commendable. You handled it and even beat those thugs up. The most annoying person today is that stupid Derek!”<br/>Mr. Vasilios nodded toward his daughter. “She’s right. You made my daughter happy and put that spoiled brat in his place. I’m pleased. Serena, you picked well. As for Derek… I don’t ever want to set eyes on him again. If I do, I might just squeeze him to death.”<br/>Serena only smiled.<br/>Charles frowned. “The Tiger Fang will come back. I’m ready to take the blame.”<br/>Mr. Vasilios brushed him off. “Uhn… it’s nothing. I know Tiger… he’s a man who loves money. I’ll settle it with cash. Everything will be fine. Don’t worry.”<br/>They said their goodbyes and left. Serena was impressed by everything Charles had pulled off tonight, but she masked it. “Seems like you’re not so useless after all. You can make a good tool.”<br/>Charles frowned. Serena called him a tool? He wasn’t angry, but he didn’t like it.<br/>“Okay, can we meet tomorrow? I have somewhere to go,” Charles said casually.<br/>Serena raised an eyebrow. “Uhn? I thought you were supposed to follow me home since we’re a couple.”<br/>“Fake ones,” he reminded her. “We’re just lying to the outside world, like you said. I have to go somewhere. We will meet later.”<br/>Serena folded her arms. “Is it because of that lady?” She gestured at Lizzypie, who stood a little way off, waiting for Charles.<br/>Serena said it with a burning look. Charles, oblivious, only shrugged. “Yeah…”<br/>“Okay, bye.” Serena snapped and walked away without another word.<br/>Puzzled, Charles watched her go, then rejoined Lizzypie. She gave him a slow, impressed smile. “Well, that was quite a show. The Godfather would be proud.”<br/>“I just did what I had to do.” Charles paused. “And thanks to you… your drawing really worked. How can I repay you?”<br/>Lizzypie’s face sobered. “First, we need to talk about how you’re going to avoid getting killed by the Tiger Fang.”<br/>Charles waved a hand. “Mr. Vasilios said he’ll take care of it.”<br/>They walked to the car. Lizzypie opened the door for him and slid behind the wheel. As she drove away, she continued, “Mr. Vasilios can settle his own problem with money. They will forgive him. But Tiger will never forgive you for beating his son.”<br/>Charles puffed up with pride. “I’ll take care of them then. This Eye of Satan is working pretty well,  I even beat thirty of the thugs.”<br/>Lizzypie shook her head. “You know nothing. The Tiger Fangs are among the top five cruellest gangs in this city. They’re many, and some of them… have superpowers.”<br/>“Superpowers?” Charles repeated, stunned.<br/>“Yeah. You can’t survive a single blow from some of them, you will die. Level One Eye of Satan won’t save you. Level Two gives you x-ray vision and more speed. With that you might stand a chance. But right now? You’re as good as dead.”<br/>Charles felt cold. The world he thought he knew was changing,  strange powers and deadly gangs. He’d always dismissed the supernatural until his grandfather appeared and everything shifted.<br/>Thinking of his grandfather, he turned to Lizzypie. “Are these Tiger Fangs more powerful than the Godfather?”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed. “Absolutely not. The Godfather would wipe them out in seconds. He’s the most powerful mafia leader around,  even the Tiger Fangs pay him homage. Hearing his name alone makes them tremble.”<br/>Relief flared in Charles’s chest. So all he had to do was invoke the Godfather’s name or ask for help. He told Lizzypie this. <br/>Lizzypie cut him off. “Don’t be dumb. If you drag the Godfather into this, you have broken the rules of your trials. You will forfeit Mr. Vincent’s wealth and your chance at becoming the next godfather because you have broken the rules”<br/>“What do you want me to do then?” Charles demanded.<br/>“Activate Level Two of your Eye of Satan, that simple” Lizzypie said flatly.<br/>“How?” he asked.<br/>“That’s for you to figure out,” she replied.<br/>Charles was furious. His life was in danger, and the only thing that could save him was invoking Mr. Vincent’s name. But he couldn’t even do that!<br/>They arrived home a few minutes later, and Charles couldn’t stop thinking about how to activate the Level Two of the Satan Eyes.<br/>Again, his mind circled back to the same thought. He had only managed to unlock Level One after sleeping with Tracy. What if another encounter with a different woman was the key to reaching Level Two?<br/>He swallowed hard and glanced at Lizzypie, his heart pounding as he debated whether to ask or not.<br/>Finally, he blurted out, “Lizzypie… sleep with me.”</div>
