        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div>That night, the party went just as Mr. Moretti wanted, and Derek successfully signed the multi-millionaire deal.<br/>In no time, once the deal was in motion, he would realistically be among the big men. Everything was going according to plan.<br/>×××××<br/>Early the next morning, Charles returned to the place where he and Tracy used to live. He remembered that he had forgotten a small, old wristwatch.<br/>Just like the pendant, the wristwatch had been with him since childhood. Back then, he didn’t see it as a big deal. But after his grandfather told him about his parents and the accident, he realized the wristwatch might have belonged to one of them. He had to get it back.<br/>When he arrived, he knocked on the door and waited. The thought stung him—this had been his house just a few weeks ago. Now, he was a stranger who had to knock before entering.<br/>He knocked for ten minutes, even pressed the intercom, but no one responded.<br/>“Did Tracy know I was here and just refused to open?” he mumbled to himself.<br/>After knocking for several more minutes without any answer, he decided to turn back and leave. But before leaving, he tried the door and pushed it back…it opened.<br/>It had been unlocked the whole time. He couldn’t help but scoff at how careless Tracy was. She had always been careless, even in their marriage. He was the one who always made things right.<br/>He entered, and surprisingly no one was there. He walked straight to what used to be his room, spotted the wristwatch on the dressing table, picked it up, and was about to leave.<br/>As he passed Tracy’s bedroom door, which was right beside his, he heard a sound.<br/>He froze. That had to be Tracy. How could she not have heard his knocking? He ignored it and was about to leave when a loud voice stopped him.<br/>“Fuck! Charles really humiliated me today! With that fake wristwatch! He used it to embarrass me. I feel like strangling him,” Derek groaned angrily.<br/>Then he added, “And I don’t understand why Tracy had to come and ruin everything!”<br/>He was referring to Tracy in the third person…she obviously wasn’t there. Charles wondered if Derek was losing his mind, talking to himself like that.<br/>“Why are you so worked up? Don’t be angry at her. At least, you’re fucking the mother.”<br/>The mother.<br/>Charles froze completely, then stepped closer to the door. That voice. He knew it.<br/>“Mmm… forgive my daughter, she’s just clueless. I will let you use the second hole as forgiveness.”<br/>What the fuck! That was Mrs. Hailey…Tracy’s mother. Was she really telling Derek to use her second hole?<br/>Charles thought he was mishearing things. Or maybe it was some horrible joke.<br/>“Oh yeah, bring it on!” Derek’s voice answered eagerly.<br/>Charles peeked through the crack of the door and saw exactly what was happening.<br/>He froze, every nerve alive.<br/>A low, guttural sound tore through the air with Derek’s voice, strained, groaning with effort. <br/>And then, layered over it, another sound..Mrs. Hailey’s breathless cries, rising and falling in rhythm with the pounding.<br/>“Yes Derek… don’t stop. Ahh!”.<br/>The image seared itself into Charles’s mind even before his eyes betrayed him. He pushed the door just enough to see inside.<br/>The scene was chaotic. Mrs. Hailey, a woman in her late 40s, was getting pounded by her daughter’s lover, who was in his mid 20's <br/>Mrs. Hailey gripped the bedframe, arching her ass for Derek, who pounded into her, shifting into her second hole without hesitation.<br/> He was slamming her so hard the entire bed shook. Her breasts bounced wildly as she moaned shamelessly.<br/>“Harder… don’t stop… make me forget my daughter ever existed.”<br/>The words cut Charles deeper than any knife. His vision blurred, his knees weak. For a moment, he thought he might collapse. Tracy didn’t deserve this. Even if she had her flaws, she didn’t deserve this betrayal.<br/>“Shit…” He fumbled for his phone and hit record.<br/>They switched positions, Derek lifting one of Mrs. Hailey’s legs high for deeper thrusts. Her moans grew so loud that Derek had to clamp his hand over her mouth. <br/>Charles had a clear view of her private parts…he wanted to look away, but he had to keep filming.<br/>Derek hammered faster, then gave one final thrust. Mrs. Hailey cried out, back arched.<br/>“Yes, Daddy, I’m coming, I’m coming!”<br/>Charles flinched. Shameless—calling a man half her age daddy.<br/>Derek pulled out, spraying across her ass before smacking it and collapsing onto the bed beside her. Both of them panted, sweat dripping.<br/>The sight disgusted Charles, but he kept the camera steady. He needed proof.<br/>“Damn, you’re fifty, sexy, and dirty! I bet you are even better than your daughter,” Derek laughed.<br/>Mrs. Hailey chuckled breathlessly. “I’m sure you will get Tracy soon also. She’s just pretending to be hard. That blockhead just leaves her life and she just has to recover from that.”<br/>Charles froze. They were talking about him and  Wait. Derek hasn’t slept with Tracy yet?.<br/>“Am I better than that stupid Charles?” Derek asked.<br/>“Yes, of course,” she sneered. “He could never make me moan like this.”<br/>“Ahh, so you have been with him too, bitch!” Derek barked.<br/>“Eww, never! That trash? I can’t even imagine it…he’s such a joke,” she spat.<br/>“Now that I’ve gotten the deal and become a millionaire, I will finally be able to get Tracy..and give her anything she wants!”.<br/>Mrs. Hailey replied, “What about me, hmm? I’m her mother, and I’m giving you all my holes.”<br/>“Yeah, yeah… you too, my baby,” Derek whined, leaning in to kiss her.<br/>That was it. Charles couldn’t stomach another second. He stopped the recording and pocketed his phone. <br/>He turned and walked out of the compound. Just down the street, Tracy was heading toward him.</div>
