        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div>Sapphire felt every second pain of it.<br/>Charles’s scream ripped through her chest like it was her own body on fire. She thrashed against her restraints and shouted his name until her throat burned.<br/>“Please!” she cried, her voice breaking. “Please stop! Mr. Damien, please, I am begging you!”<br/>The current kept tearing through him. Charles’s back strained against the chair, his neck arched and his mouth open in a raw scream that barely sounded human anymore. <br/>His whole body shook violently, veins standing out as if they might burst.<br/>Damien watched with a small, satisfied smirk, his thumb resting lazily on the button. Just 3 more minutes and Charles would die painfully. <br/>“Please,” Sapphire sobbed again. Tears streamed down her face. “Just let him go. I will do anything you want. Anything. I swear.”<br/>With that,  Damien’s eyes flicked to her. Slowly, deliberately, he released the button.<br/>The electricity stopped. <br/>Charles went limp. His head dropped forward, chin hitting his chest. His breathing was shallow and broken and his body twitching weakly. He didn’t even have the strength to lift his head.<br/>Sapphire screamed his name again. “Charles!”<br/>Damien stood and walked toward her, his steps unhurried.<br/>“You will do whatever I want?” he said calmly.<br/>Sapphire nodded frantically, tears dripping off her chin. “Yes. Yes. I know you already took the chip. That’s all you need for the self-writing code to work. You can have it. You can have my project. Everything. Please… just let him go. He’s innocent.”<br/>Damien scoffed, the sound sharp and cruel.<br/>“Innocent?” he said. “This motherfucker beat half my men, double-crossed my son, and stood in front of me talking shit. He called me nothing.”<br/>Sapphire shook her head desperately. “Please, he doesn’t know anything. He’s new here. He was just talking nonsense. Please forgive him.”<br/>Charles lifted his head with effort, pain written all over his face. <br/>“What are you saying, Sapphire?” he said. “Don’t beg  a piece of shit like him.”<br/>Jasmine moved instantly.<br/>Smack. He slapped Charles. <br/>The slap cracked across the room. Charles’s head snapped to the side. He tried to straighten himself.  Using his superpower,  he tried to pull against the cuffs, but he couldn't.  He sagged back, breathing hard.<br/>“Shut up,” Jasmine snapped.<br/>Damien sighed. “See?” he said calmly. “He will never shut up. And I don’t intend to let him live.”<br/>Sapphire let out a broken sob. “Please,” she said again. “I said I will do whatever you want. Just let him live.”<br/>Damien leaned closer to her, his voice low and cold.<br/>“You should be worried about yourself,” he said. “Because I’m not intending to let you live either.”<br/>Sapphire's breath hitched. "Uhn..."<br/>"Yeah," Damien murmured as he moved closer to him.  Damien's hand was already on her, his fingers slid under the thin fabric of her blouse, pushing aside the lace of her bra until his palm cupped her breast fully.<br/> He brushed his thumb over her nipple, circling it with casual cruelty, watching her face for every flicker of reaction.<br/>He pinched lightly, rolled the sensitive peak between his fingers, and felt her body tense against the restraints.<br/>Sapphire couldn't do anything except her silent cry. <br/>From the other chair, Charles jerked weakly, he threatened,  "Your hand will go for that."<br/>Damien didn’t even glance at him at first. He just smirked, gave Sapphire’s breast another slow, possessive rub, squeezing it hard this time, then finally turned his head.<br/>"You angry, kid?" he said, amusement dripping from every word. "Don’t tell me you two are dating. She's, like, over ten years older than you?"<br/>He let the question hang in the air, fingers still moving on her breast. Sapphire’s cheeks burned with shame and fury, but she didn’t pull away because of Charles. <br/>Damien leaned in closer, his mouth near her ear. "Is this the man you are rejecting me for?, this poor little man!" He gave her nipple another lazy pinch. "Uhn."<br/>Sapphire swallowed hard, tears slipping down her temples into her hair. H<br/>"If it’s me that you want... fuck me however you want. Please. Just let Charles go. He’s innocent. Please." <br/>She forced the next words out, hating herself for them. "You can keep touching my breast. You can do anything to me."<br/>Damien pulled back just enough to look into her eyes, his hand still inside her bra.<br/>"Wow," he said softly, almost admiring. "What a romantic drama we have here. You refused to give me yourself for years... and now, the second your little boyfriend’s in danger, you will spread your legs on command."<br/>He squeezed her breast again, harder this time, making her gasp.<br/>"News flash, Sapphire," he continued, voice velvet over steel. "Even if you let me fuck you, right here, I’m still going to kill this man."<br/>"He’s a threat to me. He beat my men. He disrespected me”.<br/>Damien was concerned because he knew the original incident about his son and Charles kneeling down. If the public later knows the truth, it might damage his reputation.<br/>Sapphire shook her head violently, tears spilling down her face.<br/>“Please don’t do this,” she begged. “Please… just let him go.”<br/>Damien’s expression hardened.<br/>“Look at you,” he said coldly. “I will kill him. And I will kill you too. For defying me. For letting this man humiliate me.”<br/>Sapphire sobbed.<br/>“I will fuck you before i kill you” Damien continued calmly, “and then I will erase both of you for good.”<br/>She broke down completely, crying his name, crying Charles’s name, her body trembling.<br/>“I'm sorry for putting you into this”.<br/>Damien paused. Then his lips curved slightly.<br/>“But,” he said, “there is one thing that can make me forgive you. Only you”<br/>He nodded once.<br/>Jasmine stepped forward, holding a small metallic device no bigger than a coin. He slid it into a syringe-like injector, its surface faintly glowing.<br/> Without hesitation, Jasmine pressed it against Charles’s neck and triggered it.<br/>Charles jerked, gasping. “What— what was that?”<br/>Before anyone could react, Jasmine moved to Sapphire and did the same. She cried out sharply as the device was injected beneath her skin.<br/>Charles could feel the metal under his neck. “What did you put inside us?”<br/>Damien straightened, feeling superior.<br/>“A neural kill-chip, perfectly calibrated. If activated, your head explodes instantly without warning.”<br/>Sapphire went pale in horror.<br/>Damien turned toward her and held up a small black remote. He placed it into her trembling hands.<br/>“This,” he said, “is Charles’s trigger. Press it and let his head explode, kill him with your hand.”<br/>He added with a smile, “And I will forgive you. I will let you live. You will become my wife. And together, we will rule Winchester.”</div>
