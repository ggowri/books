        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div><p>Serena’s claim that they were all friends immediately made Norman and Derek look like fools. She had done it intentionally.</p><p>Then she faced them. “I don’t understand. Why would you call her a whore? What made you do that? And you’re not expecting to be slapped? You deserve more than that.”</p><p>Diana chimed in. “Oh, I think both of you are wrong. You misunderstood the situation. Now, go on your knees and apologize to them both.”</p><p>Hearing that made Norman’s fury rise. The thought of apologizing to Charles made him sick.</p><p>“Ma, but that doesn’t even give him the right to slap someone. I think we should address that,” he said.</p><p>Diana’s expression turned cold. “You called someone a whore, and right in front of me, I watched you humiliate this young man—lying that he cheated on Serena. You didn’t even know the truth, yet you two were yapping about him cheating.”</p><p>She added, “If you refuse to bow and apologize, I won’t only have you thrown out of here, I will make sure you are arrested for slander and false accusation.”</p><p>Diana was dead serious. Derek wasted no time; he immediately went bent his head very low.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I misunderstood the situation, I shouldn’t have said all that, please forgive me” Derek said quickly.</p><p>Norman was still fuming hard while Diana stared at him. He gulped and looked around, seeing how everyone’s eyes were on him. He couldn’t afford to offend the state secretary. He swallowed his pride and bent slightly.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he simply said.</p><p>Diana interrupted, “I won’t take that. Bow lower, and sound sincere. Tell him it was just a misunderstanding.”</p><p>Norman growled in anger but had no choice. He bent lower. “I’m sorry. It was all a misunderstanding,” he said, and everyone witnessed it.</p><p>“That’s good,” Diana said. Then she turned to Charles and Lizzypie. “I also owe you both an apology. I nearly misjudged you. Please accept my apology.” She bowed slightly to them. The state secretary.</p><p>Charles bowed back.</p><p>“Let’s go in,” Diana told Serena. On their way inside, Serena planted a kiss on Charles’s cheek in front of everyone, symbolizing their love and affection.</p><p>Charles just stood there, surprised and amazed at how she handled the situation. That was really sweet. The kiss sent a small electric shock down his body. Serena was taking this fake relationship more seriously.</p><p>Tracy was fuming and sneered. “You wronged me tonight, but you used your fiancée’s connection. I’m sure you’re a bad person, and I hope one day people see who you really are.”</p><p>Charles just smirked, then turned to leave.</p><p>Norman, still embarrassed, barked, “So what the heck are you even doing here? I’m sure you are just here to watch people bidding.”</p><p>“Who told you that? I’m here for the auction too. I will make a bid,” Charles said.</p><p>Bidding in an auction was like a war among the wealthy. Whoever won gained enormous respect. His name would spread across the city, especially if he won a bid worth thousands of millions. Norman was there to win and brag about it. He wondered if Charles was serious, but he believed Charles couldn’t do anything here. He was too poor, even with his 120 million dollars.</p><p>“I’m here to bid too,” Charles repeated.</p><p>Derek scoffed. “Yeah, sure. Just to show off and bid on cheap stuff that will only drain your money. But such impressions don’t last long. For people to respect you here, you have to win a bid that exceeds five hundred million. This auction is for big men.”</p><p>Even Derek and Tracy were only there to watch. It was a major auction, held in the national hall, people would want to show off and will stretch the bidding so long.</p><p>“I’m here to bid on the Nytheris Black Stone,” Charles said.</p><p>“What! Are you dense or stupid? The Nytheris Black Stone is the highlight of tonight’s auction, and many people came just for it. Anyone who wants to win it must have at least one billion dollars to spare. Do you even know what the Nytheris Stone is? One of its kind, the most dazzling stone ever found!” Norman barked.</p><p>One might think one billion dollars was too much, but the Nytheris Black Stone was worth even more. Anyone who owned it could treat it as a rare treasure and charge people at least a hundred thousand dollars just to view it. One hundred thousand dollars per person, that would be a lot of money to earn.</p><p>Charles gulped when he heard that. One billion dollars—that was insane. He didn’t have that kind of money, but he stayed calm and composed. “Yeah, I know. That’s what I’m here for,” he said.</p><p>Tracy laughed. “They are talking about one billion dollars, not one million. Let me make that clear in case you misheard.”</p><p>“I heard you clearly,” Charles replied. “And I’m assuring you—I’m taking the Black Stone home.” He walked inside, with Lizzypie following closely behind.</p><p>Derek shook his head and said to Tracy, “He’s crazy. How did you even marry him in the first place? All he’s got is pure luck.”</p><p>Norman smirked. “Yeah, and luck always runs dry. He will be taught a lesson soon—maybe even tonight.”</p><p>Then they all entered the bidding hall.</p><p>Inside, it was wide and spacious. The national hall could contain ten thousand people, making it the perfect place for this grand auction. Everyone wanted the fame, the sound of applause, and the respect that came with winning.</p><p>Charles and Lizzypie found seats at the far back since the front was crowded. Norman passed by and sneered, “Yeah, exactly where you belong—behind.”</p><p>He, Derek, and Tracy walked toward the front.</p><p>Just then, a lady came to Charles and informed him that the state secretary wanted him and Lizzypie seated in front.</p><p>She led them to the front row, to a special seat Diana had prepared. They both sat gently, and at that moment, Serena also sat beside Charles—with Lizzypie on his right and Serena on his left.</p><p>Everyone could see them, and whispers filled the hall.</p><p>“Who is that guy?” someone murmured.</p></div>
