        <h1>Chapter 14.</h1>
        <div>Charles had never seen Tracy dressed like this before. What in the world? he thought.<br/>Was this her new life after the divorce, throwing away her Buddhist principles to chase some distorted version of her “true self” with Derek?<br/>A tangled storm of emotions churned inside him. Here he was, wandering the streets with nowhere to sleep, while his wife, who caused all of it,  had already moved on without hesitation.<br/>For a fleeting moment, he regretted not giving in to that landlady earlier.<br/>He had clung to the belief that Tracy still carried some dignity, that maybe this was why she hesitated with the divorce. But he had judged her wrong. Tracy had been toying with his heart all along.<br/>Just then, his phone rang. John’s name flashed on the screen. Charles answered immediately.<br/>“Charles, what’s going on?” John blurted out, skipping any greeting. “Am I seeing this right? That woman in the video...it’s Tracy, the wealthy CEO, isn’t it? Or am I losing my mind? Didn’t you say she was into Buddhism, all about being the most decent woman? And you didn’t even tell me anything?”<br/>Charles stayed silent. That was exactly why he hadn’t told John before...because he had spent years bragging about his wife.<br/>John’s voice softened after the silence. “Look, man, I’m not trying to hurt you. I just thought you should know.”<br/>“Don’t worry. I’m not taking it the wrong way,” Charles said with a faint smile, trying to keep his tone light despite the sting. “You’re not wrong. That’s definitely her in the video.”<br/>“Seriously?” John’s voice was full of shock. After a pause, he added, “I saw this clip on Instagram. Someone just posted it. I know that bar. If you head there now, you might...”<br/>But Charles cut him off in his mind. No man would be fine seeing his ex-wife dressed provocatively, cozying up to another man at a bar.<br/>Yet, oddly, this didn’t crush him the way it should have. He had already caught her once before, and he had already filed for divorce. A real man wouldn’t waste his life on a woman who had betrayed him.<br/>Charles had already wasted too many years on Tracy. Now, he’s done. As for her? She could live however she wanted with whoever she pleased.<br/>“No need to go there,” Charles said calmly. “We’ll be divorced soon. Whatever she’s doing, however she’s dressing...it’s not my concern anymore.”<br/>“What?” John asked, stunned. “Man, I’m sorry. I had no idea.” He paused, then offered gently, “Hey, Charles… Want to grab a drink? I can keep you company, talk it out.”<br/>John assumed Charles must be devastated, reeling from losing such a stunning, wealthy wife. But nothing could be further from the truth.<br/>Charles was truly over it. “No need, man. I’m honestly fine,” he replied. “Plenty of fish in the sea. I’m not going to mope over one woman when there’s a whole world out there.” He chuckled, though deep inside he doubted he’d ever love again. Tracy had ruined his trust, spoiled his experience. And being broke didn’t help, what woman would want him now?<br/>John’s tone shifted to admiration. “Charles, you’re unreal. Good thing you are keeping it cool. You will find another woman like her in no time…hell, probably someone even better.”<br/>“Thanks for the consolation,” Charles said with a laugh. They chatted a little longer before ending the call.<br/>The video John mentioned? Charles didn’t bother watching it again. Tracy was nothing more than an almost-ex-wife. He had no interest in keeping tabs on her.<br/>What mattered more right now was one thing: where he would sleep tonight.<br/>Just then, his phone rang again.<br/>Thinking it was John, Charles answered without looking. “Yeah, John…”<br/>“Hello, Mr. Charles.”<br/>He froze. That voice, he recognized it instantly.<br/>“Mr. Zoe?” Charles said slowly, his brows knitting. Tracy’s personal assistant. Why was he calling?<br/>“Yes, it’s me,” Zoe replied, his voice trembling with panic. “Please…we need your help. Right now.”<br/>Charles narrowed his eyes. “Help with what?”<br/>“It’s Ms. Tracy,” Zoe stammered. “She’s here… very drunk. She locked herself inside a car. She’s threatening to kill herself, to set the car on fire. She poured alcohol everywhere. If you don’t come right now, something bad might happened”.<br/>Charles’ stomach dropped. For a moment he just stood frozen. Then anger flared hot inside him.<br/>“What the hell, Zoe? How could Tracy do something like this?”<br/>This was just another one of her insane stunts. She had wrecked his life, left him with nothing, and now she wanted to claim victimhood again? He was on the streets with nowhere to go, and she, the very cause of his misery..was threatening to burn herself alive?<br/>He clenched the phone tighter. “Why should I care?” he snapped. “We are not together anymore.”<br/>“What?!” Zoe’s voice cracked with disbelief.<br/>“Yeah,” Charles said coldly. “We’re not together. Call Derek, her new lover. Isn’t he the one she chose?”<br/>Zoe’s words tumbled out in a rush. “She and Mr. Derek had a fight tonight. She won’t listen to anyone else except you. She’s screaming, threatening to burn herself and the car. Please, Mr. Charles…”.<br/>Charles let out a bitter laugh. “Unbelievable. She argues with her lover, and somehow I’m the one being called? What kind of madness is this?”.<br/>But then a darker thought stabbed through his fury. He was a firefighter. He knew what fire could do, the destruction, the lives it could claim. <br/>If Tracy truly went through with it, she wouldn’t just endanger herself. She could take others down with her.<br/>He drew in a sharp breath. His jaw locked tight.<br/>“Fine. I’m coming.”<br/>He hung up, grabbed his suitcase, and muttered under his breath as he waved down a taxi.<br/>“Tracy… when will you ever let me live my life?”<br/>He immediately stopped a taxi, so he could get there as soon as possible.</div>
