        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div>Everyone knew who Serena was—how beautiful and wealthy she was.<br/>But Lizzy Pie’s striking beauty also shone in their eyes, and a guy was sitting between them! It was like heaven to every man watching.<br/>“Damn! That guy must be rich!”<br/>“Wow, sitting in the middle of those beauties—that’s my dream!”<br/>Everyone was talking about them since they were placed right in the spotlight where everyone could see.<br/>Just behind them sat Norman and his group. He had mocked Charles moments ago for sitting at the back, and now Charles was sitting right in front of him. That made Norman furious.<br/>He muttered under his breath, “This man is stepping on my nerves so much. I’ll kill him one day.”<br/>Tracy, sitting beside him, heard every word.<br/>Right after that, the party began. Some dancers rushed onto the stage to perform before the real event started.<br/>During this time, Charles turned to Serena.<br/>“Thanks for earlier. You helped us out.”<br/>Serena looked nonchalant.<br/>“It’s nothing. I just didn’t want you embarrassing me. How many times do I have to tell you that any of your behavior will be linked back to me? Be guided, please.”<br/>Serena’s tone was cold, as usual.<br/>“Okay, babe,” Charles said.<br/>Hearing that, Serena’s eyes widened.<br/>“Babe? We are not that.”<br/>“You kissed me some moments ago,” Charles pointed out.<br/>“That was just to handle the situation—to make it look real, so they would think I wasn’t angry. Are you calling me ‘babe’ because of that?” she said sharply.<br/>Charles scoffed. “I was just joking—just a joke.”<br/>Serena gulped and bit her lips. Deep down, she wondered what Charles was doing here. She was about to ask when the dancing came to an end, and the host walked to the stage to announce the beginning of the main event.<br/>“Hello, ladies and gentlemen—men of standing, class, and prestige! Tonight, our auction of newly discovered gemstone relics begins! Most of these stones are rare and ancient. Let’s begin!”<br/>The auction started, and each stone was displayed one after another. The wealthy guests bid huge amounts, and each stone quickly found an owner.<br/>Then came the real highlight of the night.<br/>The auctioneer walked out with a small box covered in red cloth. The audience grew silent with anticipation.<br/>He began, “And here comes the star of tonight—the rarest stone on Earth! This is the only one of its kind remaining. What makes it special is that it glows under light—like it breathes, and even emits faint sounds, as though something alive is inside it. Some even claim it has healing powers! The bidding will begin now at… one hundred million dollars!”, he then unveiled the box.<br/>It was a truly black stone, with a sphere shape.<br/>Everyone gasped. That was an incredibly high starting price.<br/>The auctioneer repeated, “One hundred million! Who will bid one hundred million?”<br/>A man from the back shouted, “One hundred million! I raise one hundred million!”<br/>Instantly, another voice followed, “Three hundred million!”<br/>Charles’s jaw dropped. That was a massive leap. He only had a hundred and twenty million with him, and the bidding had already hit three hundred million. Norman was right after all—this mysterious stone was no child’s play.<br/>With the man raising the bid to three hundred million, the hall fell silent. That was a lot of money, and no one else seemed willing to continue.<br/>The auctioneer said, “We have three hundred million! Going once… going twice…”<br/>Then, suddenly, a man shouted from the back, “Five hundred million dollars!”—raising his bidding paddle high.<br/>“What? Five hundred million? Who the hell is that?”<br/>“Did I just hear five hundred million? Who in their right mind would do that?”<br/>Everyone started murmuring as they turned—and it was none other than Norman. He smirked and stood up so everyone could see him clearly. Five hundred million was a lot, but Norman had been sent by his father to get the stone at any cost. His father had given him full support and the money to back it. Bringing the stone home was the only way to make up for the twenty million he’d lost earlier.<br/>All eyes were fixed on him.<br/>The auctioneer excitedly announced, “Yes! We have Mr. Norman of  the Consortium with five hundred million!”<br/>The crowd burst into applause, almost certain he had won already. Who else could afford more than that kind of money?<br/>“So, we have five hundred million… going once… going twice…”<br/>“One billion!”<br/>Another voice thundered from behind.<br/>Everyone in the hall nearly stood up. Murmurs swelled into a single, shocked chorus.<br/>“What—what is that? Who is that? One billion?!”<br/>The man who had bellowed the new bid was Charles. Tracy and Derek’s eyes popped wide. Even Norman’s jaw slackened. Serena, beside Charles, looked as stunned as anyone. Lizzy Pie, who knew they only had about one hundred and fifty million between them, stared like she had seen a ghost.<br/>Serena leaned in, low and urgent. “What are you doing? One billion dollars—where are you going to get that?”<br/>Charles just chuckled.<br/>Serena sneered, “Are you really serious!”.<br/>The auctioneer tried to regain control. “We have—uh—one billion dollars from this mister man! Anyone? It’s going!!!” His voice wavered between excitement and disbelief.<br/>Norman sprang up, outrage cracking his tone. “Are you serious? He doesn’t have that kind of money!, he won’t pay!, you do not even know his name! ” he shouted so the whole room could hear.<br/>The auctioneer pointed at Charles. “Sir, do you understand that when you make that bid you are legally bound to pay? If you cannot, you may be held responsible.” <br/>Charles folded his hands as if discussing the weather. He turned to Norman with slow politeness. “Your bid stands at five hundred million, Norman. I chose to top it. That’s the rule. If I fail to complete payment, you will have the stone back at your five hundred. Simple as that. You don’t have to be scared”<br/>The auctioneer affirmed this “Yeah… yeah, This is how auctions proceed. If a bidder refuses to pay, the auctioneer may have the bidder arrested for fraud and the item will revert to the previous highest bidder.”<br/>A ripple of whispers, then rapid calculations and nods. Someone muttered, “yeah, I think that makes sense.” <br/>Another voice, chimed in, “If he can’t pay, Norman gets it back for five hundred million”.<br/>Norman stood there, wondering what Charles’ deal was.</div>
