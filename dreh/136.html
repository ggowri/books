        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div>Serena reached home very late at night. She pushed open the door quietly, expecting the family to already be asleep. She was shocked to see everyone sitting in the living room with their eyes glued to the TV.<br/>The atmosphere was heavy, thick, vibrating with tension.<br/>Serena stepped forward slowly.<br/> “What… happened?”<br/>No one answered. So she turned to the large TV screen. And then she saw it.<br/>The news headline flashed:<br/> BREAKING: CHARLES TAKEN BY THE PROSECUTOR — NEW EVIDENCE FOUND<br/>Serena’s breath caught as the female reporter appeared on the screen, her voice sharp and dramatic.<br/>“This just in. Prosecutors have officially taken Charles into custody after uncovering a shocking piece of evidence: a secret recording allegedly capturing the very moment he murdered Mr. Eden.<br/>“The recording, recovered from a hidden device inside Mr. Eden’s room, contains audio matching Charles’ voice during the killing.”<br/>The reporter paused, shaking her head in disgust.<br/>“At this point, authorities say there is no doubt. Charles committed the murder. He will be sentenced for sure.”<br/>Serena stepped closer, eyes wide in disbelief.<br/> “That’s impossible… he didn’t do it.”<br/>But the reporter wasn’t finished.<br/>“And in the midst of this national scandal, Ms. Serena Moretti—national beauty award winner, Best Woman of the Year, and beloved heiress of the Moretti family—was seen visiting her fiancé inside the police station.<br/>“A respected heiress standing proudly next to a murderer. Many citizens are questioning her judgment and asking the same painful question: Is she knowingly defending a killer? Here is a video of her saying she would always be by his side.”<br/>The broadcast cut to the clip where reporters had asked Serena about Charles, and she answered that she would always stay with him. As long as he told her he didn’t do it, she would believe him no matter what.<br/>Mr. Moretti angrily switched off the TV. “Fuck…” he sneered with frustration.<br/>Collins scoffed. “Yeah, that's it. I can see you’re finally seeing how foolish your beloved daughter is. How could you say that publicly?”<br/>Allison, already scrolling through her phone, sighed. “This is causing a lot of damage. People are calling her an accomplice. It’s only a matter of time before they start mentioning our company.”<br/>Serena chuckled lightly. “He hasn’t even been sentenced yet. He told me he didn’t do it.”<br/>Mr. Moretti—who had never once shouted at Serena—snapped in anger. “And you televised it! Just because he said so, you stood by him in public and declared you always believe whatever he says? Do you know the damage you have caused?”.<br/>Serena lifted her chin slightly. “Father, this will all go away when he is found innocent.”<br/>Allison scoffed loudly. “Are you that love-blinded? They found crucial evidence. The prosecutor already charged him. How is he innocent after all that?”<br/>Collins smirked. “And this is the person who’s supposed to lead our company? I can bet she’ll hand everything over to Charles the moment it comes to it.”<br/>Mr. Moretti dragged his hand through his hair in frustration. “Serena… you disappoint me this time. I even told you to avoid the reporters, but you took them head-on.”<br/>“Because Charles didn’t do it,” Serena shot back. “Why should I hide?”<br/>Mr. Moretti snapped. “Just shut up, okay? You will make a public announcement and say you only defended him because you believed him at first. Now that new evidence has appeared, you are stepping back. And during that announcement, you will declare that you’ve broken up with him. Do you understand?”<br/>Serena let out a long breath. “That means throwing him under the bus. And if he’s later found innocent, do you know what people will call me? Do you know how this will affect us?”<br/>Allison scoffed again. “But he isn’t innocent, Serena.”<br/>Serena shook her head. “Until he is found guilty in court, I can’t do that.”<br/>Mr. Moretti stared at her as if seeing her for the first time. “This is the first time you are defying me… and it’s because of a man.” His tone hardened. “Collins is right. You are love-struck and it’s making you incompetent. You will never become the CEO.”<br/>Collins smirked, trying not to look pleased.<br/>Mr. Moretti continued coldly, “If you refuse to make the announcement, I will remove you from my company… and from my legacy. You will only be my daughter. Nothing more.”<br/>Serena looked at him with trembling eyes, but her voice remained firm. “I can’t do that, Father. I… just can’t betray him like that.”<br/>She turned and walked away.<br/>Collins let out a short laugh. “Wow. Serena has actually gone crazy for that poor man.”<br/>Mr. Moretti exhaled heavily and sank into the sofa. “I’m realizing my mistake. Serena can never lead after I’m gone.”<br/>Collins stepped forward quietly. “Well… you have a son who can.” He didn’t bother hiding it.<br/>[The Elite Villa].<br/>Elite Villa was where Norman lived. He was in his room, a glass of wine in his hand, when an unexpected knock hit the door.<br/>He frowned. “Who is that?” he called out. He wasn’t expecting anyone.<br/>Then a soft, low voice floated through the door.<br/> “It’s me… Lizzypie.”<br/>Norman’s ears practically stretched in surprise. Lizzypie? Here? That Charles’ bitch?<br/> What on earth was she doing at his house?<br/>He didn’t even move to open the door. Instead, he shouted from inside, “What? What are you doing here? How did you even find this place?”<br/>“We’re here to talk about the offer you proposed,” she said calmly. “We’ll do it.”<br/>His jaw nearly dropped.<br/> The proposal? The threesome To save Charles?<br/> They were here… to actually agree to it?<br/>A sudden panic hit him.<br/> Wait, what if she came with people? What if they are here to beat me up?<br/>He froze, staring at the door as if it might explode inward.<br/>Then another thought pushed through.<br/> This is the Elite Villa. Security here is insane. They can’t do anything to me. I will just press the emergency button. <br/>He gulped, adjusted his robe, and finally made a decision.<br/>He walked toward the door and opened it.</div>
