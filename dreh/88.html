        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div><p>Alex stepped aside for Natasha to do the questioning. The leader was just standing there, gulping.</p><p>“So, tell me… who sent you here to destroy my shop if it isn’t Norman?” she demanded.</p><p>“Uhm… Steven sent us here. He sent us to damage everything and ruin you and your shop. We were just following orders. He lied to us,” he confessed quickly.</p><p>Natasha frowned and was shocked. “What? Steven asked you to do this?”</p><p>“I swear! You can check my phone — it’s in my pocket. He even paid us, and we talked on the phone,” he said.</p><p>With that, Charles searched his pocket, brought out the phone, and handed it to Natasha.</p><p>Natasha immediately scrutinized it and checked the messages. And truly, there was a transaction between him and Steven.</p><p>“This Steven… you know him?” Charles inquired.</p><p>Natasha slowly nodded, looking detached, and sniffled. “That fucker is my brother — my elder brother. He has always been sweet to me. How… How could he do something like this? It’s impossible.”</p><p>“I swear it’s him. Please, release me. I don’t want to stay like this forever,” the leader cried.</p><p>Charles stepped forward. “You better tell us the truth. If you dare lie, you’ll stay like that forever.”</p><p>“Fuck you! Why would I lie? Please, just release me and let me get the fuck away. I swear it’s him!” he shouted out. It was obvious he was being sincere.</p><p>“Well, I won’t release you until you pay for all the damages you caused here. You said Steven, or whatever, paid you, so pay her from it,” Charles ordered.</p><p>“But… we already spent it. Fuck!” he shouted helplessly.</p><p>“I don’t care. Just look for it. You have only four minutes left. You’re paying $800,000,” Charles demanded.</p><p>Hearing that, the leader knew he had no other choice. He prompted Charles quickly to go to his money app and withdraw the necessary amount.</p><p>Natasha nodded at Charles, telling him the money had dropped, and with that, he relaxed the leader’s neck. As soon as he did, the man immediately bolted out, not even waiting a second, and his thugs followed him.</p><p>Charles watched them leave before he turned to Natasha, who looked completely detached. She couldn’t believe what she had just heard.</p><p>She nearly fell down, but she held the table to support herself.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” Charles asked, helping her up, his hand brushing against her arm.</p><p>Natasha replied, “Fuck, I’m not okay. I’m an orphan, and the only family I have is my brother. He helped me build this place. Why would he want to kill me? I can’t fathom this.”</p><p>Charles sighed. He understood what betrayal did to a person. He sat her down, picked up a flat surface, and started fanning her gently.</p><p>Natasha looked at him and scoffed weakly. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“You need some fresh air, so I’m giving you some. I don’t want my CEO, where I’m the director, to faint,” he joked lightly.</p><p>That made Natasha smile faintly. Just as Charles said, the air made her feel a little better and calmer. After that, she thanked him.</p><p>“I’m so grateful. Since I called the police and they didn’t respond, I didn’t know what else to do. My mind went to you. Sorry for disturbing you.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s okay. It’s nothing,” Charles replied softly.</p><p>After that, Natasha said she wanted to go home. She stood up but was still weak.</p><p>“Let me accompany you home,” Charles proposed.</p><p>“No, it’s okay…” she tried to walk again but couldn’t. She nearly fell down, and it was obvious she couldn’t go home by herself.</p><p>“Well, that’s not up for debate,” he said, holding her arm. Together, they walked to the car and drove away.</p><p>After some minutes, they arrived at De Royal Hotel, where Natasha was living in one of the apartments.</p><p>Charles still assisted her inside. Meanwhile, at the reception, Derek was booking a room for himself and Mrs. Hailey.</p><p>Just then, his eyes caught Charles and Natasha, holding each other as they walked in.</p><p>“Mmm… What the hell are those two doing in a hotel together? There’s something more going on here,” he muttered and crept behind them quietly.</p><p>Oblivious to Derek following them, Charles assisted Natasha to her room, which was well-lit and beautifully arranged. Everywhere was pink, with Nicki Minaj photos on the walls. She was clearly a big fan.</p><p>Charles sat her down, and Natasha smiled faintly. “Thanks. I’m very grateful. You’re so sweet.”</p><p>Charles smiled and nodded repeatedly. “Thanks. Is there anything else I can help with before I leave?”</p><p>Natasha smirked — a mischievous one. “Yes, there’s something you can do to help me.”</p><p>“What’s that?” Charles asked.</p><p>“Help me off my clothes,” she said simply.</p><p>Charles stood there, startled by the request.</p><p>“What?” Charles blurted, leaning in slightly as if he hadn’t heard her correctly, his brow furrowing in confusion.</p><p>Natasha rolled her eyes, a faint smirk tugging at her lips despite her exhaustion. “I said, help me take off my clothes.”</p><p>Charles hesitated, his throat tightening as he gulped audibly. His eyes betrayed him, drifting involuntarily to the perfect swell of her breast, then tracing the elegant curve of her figure-eight silhouette.</p><p> The thought of peeling the clothes off this damsel in distress sent a rush of heat through him.Natasha whined softly. “What are you doing? My hand is weak and I can’t do it by myself, please.”</p><p>With that, Charles gulped again and stepped closer, his fingers trembling slightly as he reached for the hem of her top and began to lift it off.</p></div>
