        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div>Charles turned around slowly and scoffed.<br/>“Some days ago,” he said flatly, “you were begging me to come back. Crying nonstop. If you regret it, then shut up and stop dragging drama everywhere you see me.”<br/>Tracy laughed coldly. “That was because I was blind then. I pitied you. Those leeches around you were using you and I wanted to fix your miserable life. But it seems you enjoy poverty. Fucking wealthy women for money and kneeling for a kid just to get money.” She shook her head. “That’s pathetic. I am disappointed in you.”<br/>Charles let out a short laugh. “Think whatever you like.” Then he glanced at Collins.<br/>Tracy tightened her grip on Collins’ arm and pressed closer to him. “You look shocked, right? Collins is my fiancé. A real man. Someone far better than you. He lifted me up when you and that Lizziepie tried to drag me down. He invested in me and even helped me catch Derek.”<br/>Charles frowned.<br/>He had been the one investing quietly. He had been the one who set the trap for Derek.<br/>He looked at her sharply. “Really. How did you know that?”<br/>Tracy lifted her chin. “He told me. After saving me that day. From you and Lizziepie. Collins loves me. He knows my value and proved it. Unlike you. We divorced because all you ever cared about was sex.”<br/>Charles’ gaze shifted slowly to Collins.<br/>“Really,” he said calmly. “You were the one secretly investing in her?”<br/>Collins gulped and lost confidence at the way Charles asked the question, as if he knew something.<br/>But Tracy chimed in, “You are shocked, right? You don’t even want to believe it. Haha. That’s why you can never become anything in life!”<br/>Charles looked at Tracy. She had returned to her old self now that she had her wealth back. But he was the one behind it. Just one call and everything would fall apart for her.<br/>He also understood that Tracy was desperate to believe it was Collins. He was the only son of the Moretti family, so Tracy simply wanted to cling to him.<br/>Then Collins chimed in, “Well, it seems you have finally ruined my sister’s life. The wedding can never happen again. She could even lose her position as the promised CEO if she doesn’t break up with you. What were you even thinking, kneeling for a child? Pathetic.”<br/>Tracy added, “He can do anything for money. He used to wash women’s panties for it, so this is nothing.”<br/>“Hahaha,” Collins laughed and added, “Let’s go in already. I can’t wait to see the drama of what will happen.”<br/>They kept mocking Charles as they walked inside. Charles just smirked. Tracy was forcing herself to entertain Collins, doing everything to keep him pleased. That was the reason she was abusing Charles. Because Collins enjoyed it.<br/>He sighed and said, “Tracy, I can’t wait to see the look on your face when you find out I’m the real investor.”<br/>With that, he also walked in and made his way to the grand room. When he arrived, the entire family was already assembled.<br/>They already knew Tracy as Collins’ fiancée, and this made Mr. Moretti more considerate toward Collins. Mr. Moretti liked Tracy because she was an established businesswoman. He believed she could help his son.<br/>Charles nodded. “Good evening, sir.”<br/>Serena, seeing him immediately, rushed to his side. “Tell me… what happened? I know you had a genuine reason to kneel for that kid.”<br/>Before he could speak, the other family members started shouting.<br/>“This guy shouldn’t be part of our family. It’s a disgrace!”<br/>“Serena should break up with him already. There are too many dramas surrounding him.”<br/>“Kneeling for a kid. What disgusting behavior!”<br/>Then Mr. Moretti raised his hand and everyone went quiet. He faced Charles.<br/>He began, “Mr. Charles, I love you, cherish you, and respect you. Last week, you were all over the media for your heroic act. But everything turned into a disaster because the video of you kneeling to a kid went viral. Not just any kid. Mr. Damien of the Winchester family’s son. Do you care to explain?”<br/>Collins slammed the table. “What does he even have to explain? Nothing! What excuse could justify kneeling to a kid?”<br/>Allison added, “This should be the last straw. He should be sent out of our family.”<br/>Mr. Moretti raised his hand again for silence, then faced Charles. “Look, I’m sorry we have to do this, but currently, Mr. Damien and I are business partners. He has helped me a lot in building my empire. In fact, he is one of the figures in my life who made me what I am today. It wouldn't make sense that my daughter’s fiancé was kneeling for his son for money. It will damage things between us.”<br/>Charles sighed. He had already expected this. He stepped forward and said, “I will explain then.”<br/>“What—” Collins wanted to shout, but Tracy held him and said, “Let’s hear what he has in his dirty mouth.”<br/>Collins glanced at her for a moment, then turned away.<br/>Charles began explaining everything. How Paul stole the specialized inhaler from the girl. How he knelt just to get it back. He made everything clear and precise.<br/>Serena smiled. “I knew it. He would never stoop so low. He did what he did to save a girl.”<br/>Collins laughed loudly and said, “You really believe this nonsense you just heard? This is too perfect to be true!”<br/>Allison added, “What a story. Are you working for MyFiction now? You should start writing web novels.”<br/>Mr. Moretti then asked calmly, “Is everything you said the truth? You only kneel because Paul demanded so to save someone?”.<br/>Charles met his gaze. “Why would I lie?”<br/>Serena smiled and turned to the room. “I think every one of you owes him a big apology,” she said firmly. “And you will do it now.”<br/>Collins didn't like how this was going, and angrily stood up!</div>
