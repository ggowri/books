        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div>“What?” Tracy found it unbelievable. If Charles doesn't stay with her, where would he be? He had nowhere and no one. She turned sharply toward her manager.<br/>“You are saying Charles never stayed at the hotel?”.<br/>“Yes, ma’am, he left that very night, ” the manager replied nervously.<br/>Tracy scoffed and just threw her arms. She believed that Charles was just pulling a stunt. <br/>After some minutes, she asked for the hotel sparekey. “Give me the spare keycard to the hotel room”<br/> Tracy collected it and made her way to the hotel, meanwhile on her way, she called his number, and he wouldn’t pick up.<br/>“What are you up to Charles” she seethed.<br/>Arriving there, she rushed to the door and beeped with a soft click, and she pushed it open. <br/>She started checking around, even calling her names, but there was no sign of him. and with the signs of everything she was seeing,  it was obvious Charles would never stay here.<br/>“Wow, I booked a room and he didn't even use it?”, She muffled. <br/>Just then, her sharp eyes landed on the desk. A folded piece of paper sat neatly atop it, almost waiting for her.<br/>“I know he will leave an explanation, Charles has no capacity to leave me. ”, She said and walked towards it.<br/>Her chest tightened.<br/>She walked over, her fingers brushing the envelope. Three words were scrawled across the front in bold, unmistakable letters:<br/>[Letter of Farewell]<br/>A chill gripped her spine.<br/>“Charles,” she muttered under her breath, scoffing bitterly. “what do you think you are doing, acting so dramatic after ignoring me.”<br/>She smirked coldly and tossed the letter into the trash, unopened.<br/>She refused to believe he had the guts to walk away from her. He couldn’t. He was nothing without her.<br/>If Charles thought his silence or his little “farewell stunt” would shake her, he was wrong.<br/>His absence was convenient, actually. It gave her more freedom, more room to maneuver, especially now, Francis can leave well with her.<br/>She sat down at her desk and powered up her laptop, ignoring the faint twist in her stomach.<br/>Hours slipped by in a blur as she buried herself in files, determined not to let Charles disrupt her focus.<br/>Whether Charles holed up in another hotel or something, she did not let that bother her. After some minutes, she got her work done and closed the laptop.<br/>A phone vibrated and it was a message. Which she quickly checked. <br/>A message came from Derek, which she ignored, she thought it was from Charles.<br/> On a whim, she scrolled through her phone, searching for the chat interface with Charles. <br/>There were a few unread messages from years ago. They were from Charles, reporting to her...every moment of his life. He had always told Tracy everything back then.<br/>[Tracy, there’s a fire. I’m heading to help.]<br/>[This fire is pretty big. I might be back late. Don’t wait for me. I’ve prepared some hot soup for you. Remember to have some before you go to bed. It will help you sleep.]<br/>[No matter what happens, I will always love you.]<br/>Charles’s words blinked at her from the screen, each one gentler than the last. Always caring, always desperate to reassure her.<br/> This couldn’t be the same man now choosing not to talk to her.<br/>She scrolled further down...to the last fifteen messages, the ones she’d ignored. They stopped that night, at the hotel, when Charles had thrown himself under the falling chandelier and pulled her to safety. After that, nothing.<br/>Her stomach twisted. I should have called him, she thought bitterly, remembering the chaos.<br/>But Derek was injured and she had to attend to him. <br/>“Whatever,” she hissed, slamming the phone down. “You will come back. You always do. You need me. ”<br/>She stood, smoothing her hair with sharp, impatient fingers, and grabbed her bag to return to the office. .<br/>On her way out, her eyes flicked, just for a second, toward the wastebasket. The envelope she had tossed earlier peeked out.<br/>She stopped. Her lips curled. “Maybe it’s some pathetic love letter. His way of begging me to call, to chase him”. She bent down, snatched it up. The paper crackled in her grip.<br/>“Well,” she muttered, eyes narrowing. “Let’s see how dramatic you decided to be.”<br/>With a quick rip, she tore the envelope open.<br/>Her gaze fell on the contents, and her eyes widened, then froze. <br/>[You know I am crying as I write this letter…And now it turns out Francis is your child… ]<br/>“How… how could he possibly know?”<br/>Her mind raced to her laptop. She'd set it to auto-login since she was the only one who ever touched it. That meant every chat, every word with Derek, Charles saw it.<br/>[Goodbye, Tracy. I loved you more than you ever did.]<br/>The words slammed into her chest. Her mind jumped back to the parent-teacher conference she’d attended with Derek. Charles must have seen it.<br/>“Fuck!”</div>
