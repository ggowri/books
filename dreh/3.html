        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div>Charles swore he felt like dying! What the heck had he just heard? Tracy was willing to send him out of his own house. His own house...because of another man and his kid.<br/>Then she turned to him. “Charles, why are you so inhumane? I told you, this kid has nowhere to go and needs a mother figure. Why are you treating them badly?”<br/>Every word hit him like a hard rock. Anytime he thought it couldn’t get worse, it kept getting worse. How was he the bad one in this situation?<br/>He opened his mouth to speak, but he knew there was no sense in it anymore. This marriage was already over. He wanted to cry because he had put so much effort into it. With this, he didn’t think he would ever be in a relationship again.<br/>He slowly walked out, since they wouldn’t leave the house. He thought it best to leave himself. He didn’t want his frustration to push him into doing something bad.<br/>He went to his room and started packing his clothes and dresses. It hit him that he had nothing under his name except his clothes. Everything he had bought, he had bought for her. Only her. Thinking about it, he realized he had been such a fool.<br/>He packed everything into a suitcase and walked out of the room. Just as he was about to open the door, a voice chimed from behind.<br/>“Where the heck are you going? What’s all this?”<br/>He turned swiftly to see Tracy. She frowned and was fuming. She looked at his luggage and said, “What are you going with that?” she asked again.<br/>“What do you think? I’m leaving the house for you, like I said. I don’t want this marriage anymore,” he made it very clear.<br/>“Stop being so dramatic,” she snapped, shocking him. “You were the one who begged to marry me, and now you’re ready to divorce over something so small?”.<br/>He scoffed, folding his arms. “Dramatic? I saw you twice with that man, in a hotel with condoms...shirtless with you...and you’re willing to take his kid. Also… you just told me to leave the room for you.”<br/>“I mean leave the room, not like this. How will you survive on your own? Do you realize how poor you are? You will definitely come back here. You can’t do anything on your own without me. So why leave in the first place?”<br/>He pointed at himself. “I’m poor! Yet I get you anything and everything you want! So you are doing all this because I’m poor?.”<br/>“Ugh, everything you bought is so cheap I can’t even be seen with it. Let’s not even talk about that,” she huffed, stepping closer. “I’ve already told you, there’s nothing going on between me and him. According to my Buddhist beliefs, that would be a complete taboo.”<br/>He couldn’t take it any longer. “Fuck you and your Buddhist teaching. Stop using it to emotionally camp me.”<br/>“Don’t insult my religion.”<br/>Before he could even react, smack! Tracy’s little hand touched his cheek. It didn’t hurt much, but it was… very crazy. She was cold-blooded, but she had never hit him before.<br/>She was horrified to see what she had done. “See, you know I cherish our marriage, and I don’t want it to wither away.” Then she grabbed his bag. “You can go anywhere you want, I won’t agree to this divorce because of this little thing.” Then she left.<br/>He stood there. The air hit harder than before. It was very hard and painful to take in what had just happened. She hit him, and yet wouldn’t let him go.<br/>Did she think taking his bag would stop him from leaving? He had already made up his mind. He wouldn’t stay and cause something wicked. The boil in his heart could make him do something unimaginable.<br/>He didn’t even need the clothes anymore. He could survive with the ones he was wearing. Better that than causing trouble. So he left and walked out, far away from the house, determined to leave.<br/>Then his phone rang. It was a call from where he also worked as a retained firefighter. He wasn’t an official one; he always got called when something big came up, and got paid.<br/>“Hello,” he answered. He was told there was a big fire in a nearby neighborhood, and it was getting out of control. They needed more manpower.<br/>“Look, the fire is so big, and we already lost three firefighters. I just want to inform you of the danger ahead.”<br/>He had a choice to reject it, since it was sort-of on-call work. But he always wanted to save lives. That was his passion...before Tracy came into his life and told him to stop because it was too dangerous. Which he partially stopped.<br/>“Okay, I will be there.”<br/>Then the voice added again, “I think, it will be good to have a proper goodbye with your families before coming, because as i told you, the fire was way too much, i can't guarantee your safety”. Emphasizing to him that this was a life or death situation.<br/>“Thanks so much. We just called you to be prepared. Let’s see if the last batch can handle it.” Then the phone hung up.<br/>Tracy had always claimed to be devoted in their marriage. She did things like call when he was late or didn’t come home, she had always showed her discomfort in that firefighting thing, Charles believed she still cared for him and should meet her and say a final goodbye. Also, he would make the divorce possible, and leave, so she wouldn’t feel worried.  <br/>Lastly, he felt like seeing her one more time. Who knows what might happen to him?<br/>So he went back into the house.</div>
