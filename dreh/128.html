        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div>Charles was already snapping the rope little by little, waiting for one tiny opening to attack Norman when suddenly–<br/>THUD!!!<br/>A frying pan echoed after it was slammed into Norman’s head.<br/>Norman’s eyes rolled back and he dropped like a stone.<br/>Both him and Lizzypie froze, as they slowly lifted their heads.<br/>Tracy stood there, gripping the frying pan with both trembling hands, eyes wide like she couldn’t believe what she just did.<br/>Charles frowned. “Tracy…?”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed sharply. “What the heck is she doing here?”<br/>Charles muttered, “What are you doing?”<br/>Tracy stuttered, still terrified. “H-he will wake up soon. Tie him up first before… before you start asking questions.”<br/>Charles groaned, snapped the last strand of rope, and stood up.<br/>He rushed to Lizzypie, undid her ropes, and pulled her close.<br/>“I’m sorry… I’m sorry. Are you okay?”<br/>Lizzypie hugged him back tightly, breathing hard.<br/>Tracy rolled her eyes. “There is no time for romance. Tie him up before he wakes.”<br/>Charles nodded. He dragged Norman up, tied him to the chair exactly like they were tied, double knotting everything.<br/>Only once Norman was secured, Charles finally turned to Tracy.<br/>“What are you doing here?”<br/>Tracy swallowed, pulled something from her pocket, and held it up. It was a small pendant.<br/>Charles’ family heirloom, the one he always wore around his neck.<br/>“It dropped from you,” Tracy said. “I saw it in my room after you left. I came to return it… and I followed you here.”<br/>Charles collected it quickly. “You should have just called.”<br/>“I did,” Tracy said. “You weren’t picking.”<br/>Lizzypie folded her arms. “Why exactly were you in her room for your necklace to drop? Did you two fight again?”<br/>Tracy smirked slightly. “We didn’t fight. We… were fucked each other.”<br/>Lizzypie’s eyes narrowed. “What, you fucked each other?”.<br/>Tracy shrugged, playing innocent. “Yeah, a good and passionate sex”<br/>Lizzypie averted to Charles, “Really?”.<br/>Charles clenched his jaw but didn’t answer immediately.<br/>Lizzypie looked at him, waiting and searching his face. She inhaled sharply, hurt flashing across her eyes. Before she could speak<br/>“Ughhh…”<br/>Norman groaned, his head lifting slightly as he started to wake.<br/>Norman’s head lolled, then jerked up with a groggy snarl.<br/>“Who the fuck tried to kill me!” he roared, voice thick and slurred, blood trickling from where the pan had split his scalp. His eyes widened. “What… Ms. Tracy? You? How dare you attack me, you little—”<br/>Tracy took a shaky step back, the frying pan still clutched like a shield. “I… I saw you hurting them. I had to help.”<br/>Norman laughed, wet and ugly. “Help? I thought you hated that motherfucker and his bitch. You are all dead. I swear I’ll make you regret this.”<br/>“The one that should be regretting right now is you”, Charles said as he moved fast toward him. His foot lashed out, boot slamming into Norman’s chest. <br/>THUD!!.<br/>The chair crashed to the floor with Norman still tied to it.<br/>“You,” Charles said, voice low, lethal, “dare touch Lizzypie like that? I told you I would crush that hand”<br/>Norman spat blood, tried to twist against the ropes. “Don’t do anything stupid,  One scream and half the block hears me—”<br/>Lizzypie was already there. She ripped a strip of duct tape from the roll  and slapped it hard over Norman’s mouth. <br/>His threats turned into furious muffled howling, MMMMPH! MMMMPHHHH!<br/>Tracy’s face went white. “What are you doing? We need to call security, the police, right now!”<br/>Charles didn’t answer. He knelt, grabbed Norman’s right arm, yanked it out straight even as Norman thrashed.<br/> The hand that had grabbed Lizzypie. He raised his heel and brought it down hard on the hard. <br/>CRACK!!!<br/>Norman’s body bucked, a strangled scream vibrating behind the tape. UHHHHMMMMMM!<br/>Charles lifted his foot again. Slammed it down. Again and Again. <br/>Each hit made Norman twist and thrash, the chair legs scraping on the floor as he tried to pull his arm away but the ropes kept him locked in place.<br/>With each step, Norman's bone made a sickening crack. <br/>Lizzypie didn’t stop him, she just watched with cold fury, hands balled into fists.<br/>Tracy stumbled forward. “Charles, stop! What the fuck are you doing!”<br/>CRACK. CRACK-CRUNCH.<br/>He didn’t stop until the hand was a ruined, pulpy mess, fingers twisted at impossible angles, blood seeping between the cracks of shattered bone while some bones even splittered out. Only then did Charles step back, breathing hand.<br/>Norman lay on his side, chair toppled, tears and snot streaming down his face, muffled sobs shaking his whole body.<br/>Tracy stared at Norman’s ruined hand, her face pale. “You just… crippled him. Charles, he can never use that hand again.”<br/>Charles shrugged slightly. “Good. That was my aim.”<br/>“What!” Tracy shouted, shaking. “How can you do that? How can you be so inhumane?”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed, walked to the table, grabbed the knife Norman dropped earlier, and placed the blade right against his neck. Norman jerked hard against the ropes, muffled screaming through the tape.<br/>Tracy panicked. “What are you doing!”<br/>Lizzypie’s eyes were cold. “I’m going to put this knife in his neck and kill him.”<br/>“Are you both crazy?” Tracy shouted. “That’s murder!”<br/>Lizzypie didn’t blink. “He nearly killed us. If you hadn’t hit him, we’d be dead right now. So why not do the same to him?”<br/>“No! Charles! Say something!” Tracy begged. “We call the police. I recorded him threatening you before I came in. It’s enough evidence. He will be locked up!”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed again. “Locked up? He won’t stay there. His father will pull strings and release him. And he will come back for us. Especially you, Tracy. He hates you so much now.”<br/>Tracy frowned, shaking her head. “No… he won’t come out of this. I will make the video go viral so they wouldn't be able to contain it. You don’t have to kill him!, if you kill him, his father will find you”<br/>Lizzypie tightened her grip on the knife. “I’m doing it and dumping the body. Nobody will link it to us”, Lizzypie was cold.<br/>Tracy turned to Charles, desperate. “Won’t you say something? You already crippled him. At least stop this.”<br/>Charles sighed deeply. He stepped forward, placed a hand on Lizzypie’s arm.<br/>“Lizzy… stop,” he said quietly. “We end it here. We handed him over to the police. Tracy is right.”</div>
