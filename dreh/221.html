        <h1>Chapter 221</h1>
        <div><p>Everyone turned toward the entrance as they saw the silhouette of someone really walking out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; yeah, someone&rsquo;s coming out.&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd went quiet.</p><p>Smoke poured out first, followed by&nbsp; Charles.</p><p>In his arms was Gabriella. Unharmed, with no single scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>There were wet towels wrapped around both of them, pressed against their faces and shoulders. The fire raged behind them, but they walked straight through it.</p><p>For a second, no one spoke.</p><p>Shock froze everyone in place.</p><p>The head guard stared in disbelief. &ldquo;What&hellip;? He actually went in and saved her?&rdquo;</p><p>Another guard whispered, &ldquo;But the fire was everywhere&hellip; how did he do it&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Belly didn&rsquo;t wait for another word.</p><p>&nbsp;He shouted. &ldquo;Gabriella!&rdquo;</p><p>He rushed forward.</p><p>Charles lowered her gently and set her on the ground. She was alive. Breathing safely.</p><p>Mr. Belly rushed to her side. &ldquo;Gabriella, are you okay? Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>She reached out weakly. &ldquo;Father&hellip; I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned her head slightly and looked at Charles. &ldquo;That man&hellip; Did you hire him? He saved me.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Belly finally looked up at Charles properly.</p><p>Before he could say anything, sirens wailed loudly as the firefighters arrived.</p><p>Everyone scattered as they rushed in, dragging hoses, smashing windows, moving fast to put out the fire.</p><p>An ambulance pulled up immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Help needed here,&rdquo; Mr. Belly said firmly. &ldquo;She needs treatment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really okay,&rdquo; Gabriella tried to say.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t even listen.</p><p>She was lifted onto a stretcher and wheeled into the ambulance. Mr. Belly followed closely.</p><p>Charles stood where he was.</p><p>Just before getting in, Mr. Belly turned back and looked at him. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Follow us.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles hesitated for half a second, then nodded and got in.</p><p>As the vehicle drove off, people murmured quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell is he?&rdquo;</p><p>---</p><p>At the hospital, about twenty minutes later, Gabriella was stabilized and moved to a private room.</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t badly injured, but Mr. Belly refused to leave her side until the doctor reassured him.</p><p>&ldquo;She just needs rest,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Only then did Mr. Belly's ease.</p><p>He turned to Charles and bowed slightly. &ldquo;Thank you for saving my daughter. Those guards were useless.&rdquo;</p><p>Gabriella smiled weakly. &ldquo;Father, I think he&rsquo;s a Cultivator also. He used his power to take me out. He even walked through fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles stiffened slightly. They knew about Cultivator?.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Belly looked impressed. &ldquo;Oh? Really. Then please, if you don&rsquo;t mind&hellip; who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles shook his head. &ldquo;Just a passerby. I saw what happened and couldn&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Belly nodded slowly.</p><p>Just then&mdash;The door burst open.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Gabriella?! Where is my fianc&eacute;e?!&rdquo;</p><p>The voice was sharp and furious as Raphael stormed into the room.&nbsp;</p><p>The moment he saw her, his expression cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;Gabriella.&rdquo;</p><p>He rushed to her side.</p><p>She grabbed his hand tightly, tears streaming. &ldquo;Baby&hellip; I nearly died. I thought I would never see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael&rsquo;s voice softened completely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t there. If anything had happened to you&hellip; I&rsquo;d never forgive myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles watched silently. This was not the Raphael he knew.&nbsp;</p><p>Gabriella turned and pointed weakly. &ldquo;You should thank him. He saved me.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael straightened and followed her gaze. Then his eyes landed on Charles.</p><p>He squinted and immediately recognized him. &ldquo;Him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gabriella said. &ldquo;He saved me.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael stepped forward and grabbed Charles by the collar.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing with my fianc&eacute;e?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Belly and Gabriella froze in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Mr. Belly demanded.</p><p>Charles frowned. &ldquo;What are you even saying? I saved her life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; Raphael snapped. &ldquo;Bullshit. Why were you there at the exact moment she needed help?&rdquo;</p><p>Charles scoffed. &ldquo;What, I can&rsquo;t save someone because of coincidence?&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael&rsquo;s face darkened. He drew his fist back and tried to punch him.</p><p>&ldquo;Raphael!&rdquo; Mr. Belly shouted. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand. He&rsquo;s our savior. He saved my daughter&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p><p>Gabriella nodded quickly. &ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s just a passerby.&rdquo;</p><p>Raphael laughed coldly. &ldquo;Oh, he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned fully toward Charles. &ldquo;I know this motherfucker.&rdquo;</p><p>Then his voice dropped. &ldquo;Whatever you are doing, you better stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Belly tried to speak again. &ldquo;Raphael&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Raphael barked as Mr. Belly recoiled</p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; Raphael continued, &ldquo;maybe he&rsquo;s the one who set the explosion and staged all this just to play hero.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles stared at him. &ldquo;Why would I do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fucking care,&rdquo; Raphael snapped. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know. We already fixed our fighting date, you shouldn't do any dirty trick &rdquo;</p><p>He shoved Charles back and released him. &ldquo;Get the fuck out. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles straightened his clothes calmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Out. Now,&rdquo; Raphael repeated. &ldquo;Or we will have the fight here.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles glanced at Gabriella.</p><p>She was watching him, confused, scared and still shaken.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want violence here. Not in front of her as he still needed to get close to her.</p><p>So he stayed calm.</p><p>&ldquo;I only saved your fianc&eacute;e when you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Charles said evenly. &ldquo;If this is how you want to react, fine.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned toward the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I will leave.&rdquo;</p><p>And without another word, Charles walked out. </p></div>
