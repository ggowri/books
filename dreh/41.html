        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div>Charles showed no fear, even threatening that he would beat Majik and all the thugs with him.<br/>The people at the banquet murmured, wondering how a single man could face thirty armed thugs. That was impossible.<br/>“I know you’re eager to save your lover, to play the hero, but do you really think you can beat all of us?” Majik said.<br/>“We can only know that if we fight. Why don’t you bring it on, and I’ll show you what people like you deserve?” Charles replied.<br/>Majik stepped closer. “I love your guts, but they won’t do you any good. You’ll regret this. This is your last warning, back off now, or I’ll have them kill you.”<br/>Tracy mumbled, “It’s okay, Charles. I’ll handle this myself.”<br/>She said it in a way that seemed like she cared about him. Serena scoffed at the scene.<br/>“Asshole! leave this place now, or fight me,” Charles said, cool and steady.<br/>“What! You call me an asshole?” Majik roared and swung a punch, but Charles weaved and countered with a quick blow to his nose.<br/>Crack.<br/>Everyone froze in horror at the sound.<br/>Majik clutched his nose as blood poured down his hand. “What… what! Kill him!” he screamed.<br/>The thugs charged with daggers and clubs. One swung at Charles, who dodged low, lifted the man in a judo throw, and slammed him to the ground.<br/>The others hesitated, stunned that Charles had thrown their largest and strongest member as if he were nothing.<br/>“What are you waiting for? Kill him! Useless trash!” Majik shrieked.<br/>The thugs rushed again. This time, Charles awakened the aura within him.<br/><Eye of Satan—activated.><br/>Time seemed to slow as Charles moved with brutal precision, snapping joints, dodging blades, and striking with impossible speed. Within a minute, all thirty men lay writhing on the floor.<br/>The crowd gasped in awe, even Serena and Derek, who had seen a glimpse of his strength before, were stunned.<br/>“Did… did that man just do all this?” Ms. Riley stammered.<br/>“What! He beat thirty thugs in one minute. He’s a demon!” another whispered.<br/>Mr. Vasilios was impressed beyond words.<br/>Tracy, however, only stared at Charles, shocked more than anyone.<br/>Derek, both envious and furious, wished he had been the one to crush the gang. Instead, he stood there a coward, unable to lift a hand.<br/>Charles walked toward Majik. “I told you to leave nicely.”<br/>Majik trembled. “Do you know who I am? I’m Tiger’s son! Touch me, and I’ll make sure your end is tragic!”<br/>“Enough with your threats. You can’t do anything to me,” Charles said coldly.<br/>“Don’t touch me, you psychopath! I’ll have my father kill you and everyone close to you!” Majik barked.<br/>That set Charles off. His fist drew back, ready to deliver another devastating blow.<br/>“Please, stop! It’s okay, please!” Tracy screamed.<br/>“Don’t worry… I will deal with this uncultured man,” Charles muttered, grabbing Majik’s shirt.<br/>“I said it’s okay, Charles!” Tracy yelled again. For a moment, Charles thought she actually cared.<br/>But he struck anyway, landing another hard blow.<br/>Tracy’s voice rose in fury. “What do you think you’re doing? I told you to stop! Are you going to face the consequences alone? You just dragged us deeper into danger. Why are you so stupid?”<br/>Charles stared at her, stunned. He had thought she cared—yet she only worried about herself.<br/>“What did you just say?” he asked.<br/>“Yes! You heard him. He said he’d kill you and everyone close to you. In fact, everyone here is in danger. You just put us all at risk!” Tracy shouted.<br/>Charles’s heart sank. He had only been trying to protect her.<br/>Majik rose unsteadily to his feet. “She’s right. I’ll kill you and this woman. I’ll hunt down everyone close to you. They’ll all die because of you.”<br/>Charles chuckled darkly. “Do you think I’m scared of your threats?”<br/>Tracy grew even more upset, shocked at how reckless he was becoming. “Don’t you hear, Charles? I said it’s none of your business. Just because you can fight doesn’t mean you can gamble with our lives. You’re putting us all in danger!”<br/>“How am I putting everyone in danger? I just saved you all,” Charles argued.<br/>Derek seized the chance to pile on. “Saved us? You’ve just doomed us.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “I can’t believe someone who hid like a coward and got his ass beaten has the nerve to talk.”<br/>People chuckled.<br/>Derek muttered, “Who said I was hiding? I know when to back down. I predicted this. The Tiger Fang once wiped out a whole family for defying them. I was acting weak on purpose.”<br/>He was lying, but continued anyway. “I only stepped aside to save us from the same fate.”<br/>Majik smirked. “You heard him. Beg for forgiveness, and maybe I will let it go.”<br/>Charles exhaled. “I’d rather beg for scraps in the street than kneel before trash like you.”<br/>Derek laughed bitterly. “Look who’s calling someone trash. You’re nothing but a parasite, showing off to impress people.”<br/>Majik’s eyes gleamed coldly. “You refuse to kneel? Then everyone here will pay.”<br/>Serena finally spoke up. “You’ve gone too far, Majik. This is Mr. Vasilios’s territory. You ruined a party, harassed women, and now you threaten everyone here.”<br/>Majik sneered. “You think I fear the Vasilios family? The Tiger Fang will wipe you out in one strike. If you want peace, make him kneel.”<br/>When no one moved, Majik’s lips curled. “Then you’ve invited this upon yourselves. Everyone here will suffer. Let’s go.”<br/>His remaining bodyguards staggered and limped out.<br/>The hall buzzed with anxious whispers. “What’s going to happen now? Who is this man?”<br/>Tracy turned on Charles, distressed. “See what you’ve caused.”<br/>“I can’t believe everyone is blaming me when all I did was protect you,” Charles said, bitter.<br/>“You didn’t protect anyone. You just showed off,” Derek sneered.<br/>Tracy stepped closer. “Charles, they’ll come back. Let’s run far away, somewhere they’ll never find us.”<br/>“Are you telling me to run?” Charles asked.<br/>“Yes… let’s go. Together. Before they do something terrible to you,” Tracy murmured, genuine fear in her voice.<br/>Derek’s face hardened at that. Even Serena noticed Tracy still wanted Charles back.<br/>Serena watched closely, curious what Charles would choose.<br/>“No,” Charles said firmly. “Thanks, but I’ll face this. I don’t want anything to do with you again.”<br/>Tracy’s face burned with anger at his rejection. Derek smirked in triumph; Serena’s eyes narrowed in satisfaction.<br/>“Why are you so stubborn? This isn’t you!” Tracy snapped.<br/>“Stop pretending you care. Just go and leave me here,” Charles said.<br/>Tracy’s voice cracked with rage. “Then die! I don’t care!” She stormed out, slamming the doors behind her.<br/>Derek slipped away quietly, seizing the moment to escape.</div>
