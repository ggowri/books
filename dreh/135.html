        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div>Serena faced him directly. “Is that true? Did you collect ten million dollars from him by force? And the stones too?”<br/>Charles explained everything, step by step, then added, “I collected that ten million because he destroyed Tracy’s company.”<br/>Serena scoffed sharply. “So you went to collect ten million dollars for your ex-wife. You’re in this mess because of her and I met her outside. She wouldn’t even come in, saying she didn’t want to ruin her reputation. Why are you still dwelling on that bitch when she has done nothing to your life except damage it.”<br/>Lizzypie nodded in agreement, her face saying she supported every word Serena just said.<br/>Natasha stepped forward. “This isn’t the time to blame anybody,” she said. Then she turned to Charles. “What can you say about the video?”<br/>Charles replied calmly. “He’s lying.”<br/>Lizzypie folded her arms. “Then that means only one thing. He’s the one trying to frame you.”<br/>They all nodded at that.<br/>Serena asked, “So what should be our next step?”<br/>Natasha said, “We will investigate this together and look for evidence.”<br/>Serena nodded immediately. “Yes. We will do that.”<br/>Lizzypie looked amused by how they suddenly worked like a team. “I will take care of it. Wilson is dangerous. If he senses anything he will attack you.”<br/>Natasha narrowed her eyes. “So you’re saying we should sit and watch? Charles is my friend. He has done a lot for me. This is nothing compared to what he did for me.”<br/>Serena added, “And I am his fiancée. There’s no way you can tell me to stop.”<br/>Charles scoffed lightly. “Well… thank you all. I will get out of this. We should have a drink together after everything.”<br/>Lizzypie smirked. “A drink? For threesome?”<br/>The room fell silent. Lizzypie made everyone feel awkward.<br/>“Lizzy!” Charles snapped. “No. What are you thinking.”<br/>They all scoffed, feeling embarrassed.<br/>Then a voice came from behind them.<br/>“What is all this?”<br/>They all turned toward the voice.<br/>Norman stood by the bars, his right hand thickly bandaged, his face still bruised. He sneered at all of them.<br/>“So this is it,” he said. “All of you are crowding around a murderer like he’s some saint. Laughing.  Acting like he’s innocent.”<br/>Serena stepped forward. “What is your business here? Why are you even at the station?”<br/>Norman smirked. “To mock him, of course. To finally see him behind bars. I’ve waited for this moment. Finally seeing him in despair”<br/>Lizzypie rolled her eyes. “Enjoy it while it lasts.”<br/>Norman clicked his tongue. “You people act like a cult, seriously. All of you are worshipping this one useless man. Don’t tell me he used voodoo on you.”<br/>He pointed at Serena.<br/>“And you, congratulations. You just spoiled your reputation by stepping into this station. Tomorrow morning your name will be dragged across the entire country.”<br/>Then he pointed at Natasha.<br/>“ Miss, a promising Businesswoman — this will come back to bite you too. Associating with a criminal? Good luck.”<br/>Then his finger moved to Lizzypie.<br/>“And you… you could just walk away from this loser and move forward, but no, you’re still here hanging around him like a dog. Pathetic.”<br/>Natasha’s face darkened. “You are spewing nonsense. We all love him and we will do anything for him. Isn’t that right?”<br/>She looked at the others and they all nodded.<br/>“Yes!”.<br/>“Exactly,” Serena added. “So you can keep being in pain.”<br/>Norman’s face twisted. He clearly hated that answer.<br/>But then he exhaled sharply.<br/>“Fine. But let me tell you,  I know one thing that can actually prove he didn’t do it. Because he was obviously framed.”<br/>Everyone froze.<br/>Lizzypie raised an eyebrow. “Really?”<br/>Norman nodded slowly. “Yeah. I swear. With clean evidence. I know who set him up.”<br/>Charles didn’t say a word, just narrowed his eyes.<br/>Norman leaned forward against the bars, his grin stretching. “But I’m not giving it for free.”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed. “What do you want”.<br/>“Well, it is so simple. I just want two of you, to let me fuck you at the same time. A threesome. With that, I will give you the clear proof”.<br/>Charles was so angry with this and said, “I will rip your mouth off for that”. <br/>Norman said, “You are not in position to talk. Let the ladies do the talking. So… what are you saying. You gave this useless man sex. I'm sure of it. Why can't you do the same to me also, and your toy boy will be released. A hot threesome!”.<br/>"Are you out of your damn mind?" Serena spat, stepping forward as if she might lunge at Norman. Her voice was low and venomous, echoing off the cold cell walls. <br/>"You think you can waltz in here, bandaged up like a pathetic loser, and blackmail us with some sleazy proposition? For evidence? You are lower than dirt."<br/>Natasha crossed her arms tightly. "This is harassment, plain and simple. And extortion. I could have you arrested right now, adding to whatever mess got your hand wrapped up like that. Who do you think you are?”.<br/>“Well, I am just proposing, you can choose whatever you want, but my offer still stands, you can come and meet me anytime”, He said and walked out.<br/>The moment the door closed behind him, Serena let out a long breath and hissed, “Ugh, that bastard. I feel like ripping him apart. Such nonsense.”<br/>Lizzypie waved a hand. “Forget him. Don’t let anything he said get to you. We will run our own investigation. We will find out the truth ourselves.”<br/>Natasha nodded. Serena nodded.<br/>After a bit more discussion about what to do next, Serena finally stood.<br/>“I will be back tomorrow. Don’t worry, Charles. We’ll clear this up.”<br/>Natasha touched his shoulder lightly. “Stay strong. We’ll handle the outside.” They both acted like Charles was in desperation, but he was as calm as water. He didn’t even fret at all.<br/>They both left the cell area, leaving only Charles and Lizzypie behind.<br/>Lizzypie waited until the hallway grew quiet.<br/>Then she stepped closer to the bars, her expression softer than usual.<br/>“Charles,” she said calmly, “Ms. Serena is the perfect woman for you. You should marry her as soon as possible.”<br/>————————<br/>November（The settlement amount is 88,000 words. Currently, all of the 137,000 words have been settled.）</div>
