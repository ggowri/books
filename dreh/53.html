        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div>Serena was shocked by what she had just heard and glared at her father. He already knew about the engagement, and he had initially supported it. But now, he was suddenly opposing it.<br/>“Father… he’s the one I told you about. We are already engaged, and everyone knows it! Why are you saying no?” she demanded.<br/>Then Collins, her brother, spoke up. He wanted to be the heir, but he was a well-known dullard who gambled a lot and chased women endlessly. He knew nothing about business. Yet, since he was the firstborn, he believed the position should be his. Everyone, however, knew the seat rightfully belonged to Serena, the third-born, because of her sharpness and all she had done for the family.<br/>That made Collins hate her.<br/>“Do you think this is up for debate?” he snapped. “You brought home a pauper with no background, and you expect us to accept him?”<br/>Allison, the second-born, added with a sneer, “You want to stain this family? This dustbin of a man doesn’t belong here. What Father said is final. You can’t argue it.”<br/>Charles just stood there in shame.<br/>Serena fought back, her voice trembling with anger. “I don’t care what anyone in this family thinks! I can marry whoever I want, rich or poor. It’s nobody’s business!”<br/>One of the uncles spoke up.<br/>“You are the most beautiful woman in this city, Serena, and you think this is the kind of man that fits you?”<br/>A cousin quickly added, “He shouldn’t have stepped inside here in the first place. I feel like vomiting just looking at him.”<br/>Another chimed in, “He’s also a troublemaker. I heard he offended Tiger yesterday. If not for our family’s influence, the almighty Godfather wouldn’t have helped him.”<br/>Charles just stood there, watching them blabber among themselves. His jaw tightened. For a brief moment, he was tempted to tell them he was the Godfather’s grandson, just to see their faces twist in shock. But he held himself back and kept it cool.<br/>Serena did not waver. “Like I told you before, no matter what anyone says, he will be my fiancé.”<br/>Mr. Moretti had never liked Charles at first, because Charles was poor. But Charles proved him wrong at the party, and he would have respected his daughter’s choice if things were as they used to be. But the family and his empire were crumbling.<br/>Mr. Vasilios was running him dry and taking pieces of the business, and Moretti needed power and allies. Charles could not give him that.<br/>So, he yelled at Serena, “You live in this family, Serena. You are my daughter, and you will listen to me. You cannot marry this poor, shabby insult to our name—and obviously a gold digger!”<br/>Serena staggered as if struck. “Father,” she whispered, “why are you doing this?”<br/>Charles stepped forward, throat tight.<br/>“Uh…,” he began. He wanted to tell them the engagement was fake anyway, just temporary, that they only had to bear with them for a while.<br/>But Serena pressed a hand against his arm and stopped him. Her eyes told him to hold it. She knew what she wanted to do.<br/>Mr. Moretti fixed Charles with a look. “You wanted to say something?”<br/>Collins, smelling triumph as Serena lost the family’s respect, leaned in. “That’s what happens with poor people. They get one chance and think they’re something else. What gives you the right to open your mouth in this family? Look, you better get out and leave this place now before we call security.”<br/>Everyone started abusing him.<br/>Serena was so angry that she slammed the table. “Father! I’ve respected this family so much, and I’ve always done my best. It’s time you respected my own decision as well!”<br/>Mr. Moretti leaned forward. “If you really care about this family and us all, you won’t marry this man. Because I have already matched you with Young Master Norman, the heir of Consortium Enterprises. He is on his way, and it wouldn’t look good if he sees you with another person—especially a poor man.”<br/>Consortium Enterprises was a massive oil and gas empire, but what truly set them apart was their powerful bloodline. Each family member held a key government position, from ministers to mayors, making them a dynasty of both wealth and influence. Everyone respected them.<br/>Serena’s eyes widened. “So you’re selling me away for the sake of this family? You don’t even care about my feelings?”<br/>Mr. Moretti’s voice turned cold. “Since when do you care about feelings, Serena? Until last week, you were cold and dangerous. Don’t let this stupid poor man change you. Norman is a handsome, decent man—you will like him.”<br/>Serena shook her head. “Charles is the only person I want. I don’t care about Norman! You know how arrogant he is, and how he spends money like a fool!”<br/>Mr. Moretti stood up slowly, his tone sharp. “Like I said, this is not for you to decide.”<br/>Before Serena could respond, the heavy doors creaked open. One of the maids stepped in carefully, holding the handle as she bowed.<br/>“Sir… Young Master Norman is here.”<br/>Mr. Moretti straightened his suit, forcing a smile. “Ah, Young Master Norman!”<br/>Norman strolled into the room and dropped lazily onto a plush sofa, flinging one arm over the backrest. <br/>His gaze swept across the room with arrogant indifference until a young maid carrying a coffee tray passed by.<br/>A smirk tugged at his lips. As she drew near, his hand shot out and casually slid up her thigh.<br/>The maid gasped, jolting in shock. The tray tipped, and a stream of hot, dark coffee splashed directly onto Norman’s pristine, handmade leather shoes.<br/>A deadly silence fell.<br/>Then, Norman exploded. He shot to his feet, backhanding the maid across the face with a sharp crack that echoed in the hushed room.<br/>“You clumsy little bitch!” he snarled, his handsome face twisting with rage. “Do you have any idea how much these cost?”<br/>The maid clutched her reddening cheek, trembling violently as tears welled in her eyes.</div>
