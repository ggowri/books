        <h1>chapter 70</h1>
        <div>Serena was so unsettled. She had already done a background check on Charles and knew he had nothing to his name—except that 100 million he won yesterday. So she leaned in again and said quietly,<br/>“I’m afraid you will embarrass yourself. Do you really have that money?”<br/>Charles reassured her calmly, “I know what I’m doing.”<br/>On his left, Lizzypie also leaned closer. “You are going too far, Charles. I don’t even have that kind of money to lend you. You can’t win this bid. Just drop it—we will figure something out later.”<br/>Charles smiled faintly. “Just you wait.”<br/>Norman was fuming. He had already raised the bid to the absolute limit of what his father gave him, and now Charles was raising it even higher!<br/>“Okay—1 billion! 1 billion! And it’s going… it’s going!”<br/>Just one more call and the auctioneer would award the stone to Charles. Norman had no choice but to give in.<br/>“1.2 billion!”<br/>Everyone gasped. Charles stared at Norman, who was smirking at him. Meanwhile, Derek leaned toward Tracy and whispered,<br/>“Does Charles even have over 1.5 billion?”<br/>Tracy shrugged. “No f***ing way. I told you, he’s broke—and he’s been depending on me throughout our marriage. There’s no way he could have that kind of money. I’m sure he’s bluffing… I just don’t understand him right now.”<br/>“2 billion,” Charles said, raising the bid again.<br/>Gasps filled the room.<br/>“What the f*** is happening here? Am I hearing 2 billion?”<br/>“How rich is he? This is getting really interesting.”<br/>Norman seethed, unsure what to do next. He was tempted to stop and expose Charles in front of everyone—prove he didn’t have that kind of money.<br/>But what if Charles actually did have it and won the stone? That would be humiliating—a total disgrace. His father would be furious if he lost the Nytheris Black.<br/>“2.5 billion,” Norman called.<br/>Charles raised it again. “3 billion.”<br/>“4 billion!”<br/>Charles, without hesitation: “5 billion.”<br/>Everyone gasped louder this time. The air was electric; people were recording now, phones held high, capturing every second.<br/>At this point, Norman couldn’t back down. His pride wouldn’t let him. “10 billion!” he shouted furiously, his voice echoing across the hall.<br/>“What?! 10 billion! Mr. Norman’s the real deal—there’s no way that man can match that!”<br/>“10 billion! This is insane!”<br/>Then, silence. Everyone waited for Charles’s response.<br/>“10 billion to Mr. Norman,” the auctioneer announced, “and it’s going… it’s going…”<br/>Charles stayed mute, expression unreadable.<br/>“It’s going… and it’s going… and—sold! The mighty Nytheris Black is sold to Mr. Norman!”<br/>People started clapping for Norman, the sound swelling across the hall like thunder.<br/>“I knew it!” someone shouted. “I knew Mr. Norman would get it!”<br/>“Of course, who else could afford to possess Nytheris Black?”<br/>“That other guy was just bluffing. Did he even have the money he was shouting about?”<br/>Laughter rippled through the crowd.<br/>Norman stood up, straightening his jacket, his lips curled in smug victory. The applause, the murmurs, he was enjoying it. He would use his father’s money to pay, but he was sure it worth it and his father would even be happy he got the stone<br/>Serena turned to Charles slowly. “I don’t think you can win Norman”.<br/>Norman then walked to the stage, and made the necessary payment. <br/>The auctioneer raised his hammer again. “Congratulations, Mr. Norman, on your successful purchase of the Nytheris Black!”<br/>More applause followed. Cameras flashed. Reporters moved closer. Norman’s name was already being whispered like royalty.<br/>Norman smirked at Charles, his victory sharp and mocking. The crowd, still buzzing from excitement, began to chant.<br/>“Put it under the light!”<br/>“Yeah, let us see it breathe!”<br/>“Come on, Mr. Norman! Just once!, please”<br/>Dozens of voices joined in, eager and desperate. Everyone wanted to witness the miracle—the living glow that made the Nytheris Black priceless. Legends said that when placed under pure light, the stone shimmered like a beating heart, releasing faint, melodic hums that calmed whoever heard it. People swore it could ease pain, wash away anger, even cure sleeplessness. It therapeutic.<br/>Norman could easily make his ten billion dollars back in a month if he put it on paid display. People would travel across the world and pay any amount just to see it breathe.And now, Norman held it in his hands.<br/> “Alright,” he said, raising the small, black velvet box for all to see. “Just once. For you all. I will show it for free”<br/>The crowd erupted in cheers.<br/>They pressed closer as Norman opened the box. The gemstone rested inside. With a dramatic smile, Norman placed it carefully under the glass display, right beneath the spotlight.<br/>All eyes fixed on it. Cameras lifted. People held their breath.<br/>“Here it comes,” someone whispered.<br/>“Watch any second now…”<br/>The room went still.<br/>Even Norman’s grin widened as he waited for that legendary shimmer. <br/>But nothing happened.<br/>The Nytheris Black was just there motionless, just as dull, ordinary stone.<br/>No anything special<br/>A few seconds passed. Then a few more.<br/>Whispers began spreading.<br/>“Maybe… maybe the light’s wrong?”<br/>“Did he put it upside down?”<br/>“Wait, isn’t it supposed to glow already?”<br/>Norman frowned. He tapped the glass lightly, his smile fading. The crowd leaned closer, craning their necks, stretching to see it, and still nothing.<br/>There were some old videos, recorded back then that captured the stone shimmering and breathing.<br/>Norman lost his patient and face the auctioneer, “what is all this, why isn’t it doing”<br/>The auctioneer moved closer and said softly, “I think the stone just doesn’t want to breathe yet—it’s been a long time. All it needs is to reactivate. A brief moment under the light won’t make it shine after all these decades.”<br/>The auctioneer made this announcement to everyone and they could see sense in it. <br/>“Yeah, we wouldn’t be seeing it for free after all” one of them joked and they all laughed at it. They all believed what the auctioneer said.<br/>Meanwhile, Charles just sat there smirking. </div>
