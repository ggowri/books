        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div>Charles smiled faintly.<br/>“Well,” he said, voice steady, “you know that isn’t the whole story but tell Paul to never disturb these girls again. Ever.”<br/>Jasmine’s smile twitched. “Or else what?”<br/>His eyes sharpened. “Who the fuck do you think you are to challenge Young Master Paul? You’re begging for death.”<br/>Charles stepped closer.<br/>“Look,” He said calmly. “Sapphire isn’t marrying your old boss. And these girls aren’t your young master’s toys.”<br/>Jasmine laughed, sharp and ugly. “Seems the public embarrassment wasn’t enough for you.” His eyes darkened. “I will beat you here. Strip you. Record everything. Then I’ll post it online.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “Bring it on.”<br/>Sapphire gasped. “Charles stop. Please.” Her hands shook. “They are over thirty and also trained men. They are dangerous,  you can't beat them”<br/>Jasmine glanced at her and smirked. “Look like you still have some sense. Talk your little love out of this while you can.”<br/>Tina stepped forward, tears streaking her face. “Please,” she said quickly. “He doesn’t know anything. He’s just a stranger here. Forgive him.”<br/>Jasmine tilted his head. “There is one way we will accept your apology"<br/>He raised a finger. “He will kneel and apologise. And your aunt comes with us.”<br/>Charles dipped his hand in his pocket. <br/>“None of that is happening.”<br/>Jasmine’s face hardened. He lifted his hand. “I think he really wants us to beat him”.<br/>The men behind him reached into their coats. Heavy batons slid free with dull metallic clicks.<br/>Jasmine spoke without emotion. “Break his legs. His arms. His spine.”<br/>They nodded. “Yes sir!”.<br/>Sapphire broke down, crying openly now. “Charles please. Stop. I’m begging you.”<br/>He gently pushed her aside. <br/>“Stay back, I will take care of this,” he said.<br/>Then his eyes changed.<br/>[Eyes of Satan activated.]<br/>[Xray activated.]<br/>[Flash eyes activated.]<br/>[Soul sight activated.]<br/>Charles activated all his super power mode.<br/>“Yaaa!”, They charged at him. <br/>The first baton came down.<br/>Charles tilted his head and stepped inside the swing. His palm struck the man’s throat. Cartilage crushed. The man dropped, choking, before the baton hit the ground.<br/>Two rushed him at once.<br/>Charles grabbed the nearest wrist and twisted. Bone snapped clean. He drove his elbow backward into the second man’s ribs, felt them cave, then slammed his head into the man’s nose. Blood sprayed.<br/>Another charged from the side.<br/>Charles ducked, swept his leg, and stomped the knee before it locked. The scream cut short when Charles kicked his jaw sideways.<br/>Batons fell everywhere.<br/>He moved through them, so fast they didn't see him coming. Throats crushed. Arms dislocated. Spines shocked with brutal nerve strikes. <br/>Men trained for years collapsed like amateurs.<br/>In less than a minute the street was filled with groaning bodies.<br/>Charles stood alone, breathing steady, eyes burning.<br/>Jasmine staggered back.<br/>“…What the heck?”<br/>Sapphire, Tina and Amara stood frozen, shock written across their faces. Around Charles, men groaned and struggled on the ground, clutching broken limbs and gasping for breath. He stood among them, calm, untouched.<br/>Then he turned.<br/>Jasmine met his gaze and swallowed hard, stepping back without realizing it. “H-how… how is this possible?”<br/>Charles walked closer. “Go back to Damien. Or whatever he calls himself.” His voice was flat. “Tell him to leave this family alone. They are not his toys. And tell him this… I’m coming for him.”<br/>Jasmine trembled, then forced himself to straighten. “Y-you’re threatening the almighty Damien? He owns this city. He controls the neighboring ones too. You just dug your own grave.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “No. Tell him I already dug his. And he should be scared, and I'm coming for him  very soon.”<br/>Jasmine’s face was drained of color. This was the first man who wasn’t scared of Damien. He knew fighting Charles was useless.<br/>“You are done,” he spat weakly. “We will come back.”<br/>He turned to his men, still struggling to stand. “Let’s go. We report to Mr Damien.”<br/>They dragged themselves into the cars and sped away.<br/>Charles turned back to sapphire and others.<br/>“Are you okay?”<br/>None of them answered. Sapphire, Tina, and Amara just stared at him with their mouths slightly open, still trying to process what they had seen.<br/>Sapphire swallowed. “You… you just beat them. You defeated almost twenty people.”<br/>Tina blinked hard, then let out a breathless laugh. “Wow. That was fucking awesome. You even stood up against them”<br/>Amara stepped closer, eyes shining. “You’re kind. You are generous. And you can fight.” She smiled softly. “You are really the perfect man for Aunt Sapphire.”<br/>Sapphire’s face flushed. She gulped, then waved it off quickly. “Don’t say nonsense.”<br/>And everyone chuckled at it. <br/>But the moment didn't last as Sapphire expression darkened. “They will be back,” she said quietly. “and not like this but In full force. Mr. Damien will be furious.”<br/>Tina’s excitement drained away. “He will crush us”.<br/>Amara hugged herself. “God… what will we do? We can't stay here again and we have nowhere to stay.”<br/>Silence settled over them.<br/>Charles looked at their faces, at the fear he had dragged to their doorstep. He exhaled slowly. He couldn’t just walk away. He believed this was because of him.<br/>“Follow me,” he said.<br/>They looked up in surprise.<br/>“Come live with me for now,” Charles continued. “Until things settle down. I won’t let anything happen to you.”<br/>Sapphire lifted her gaze to him and shook her head slowly.<br/>“No,” she said. “We can’t. We don’t want to be a burden to you. You have already done so much for us.”<br/>Charles frowned. “I caused this,” he replied. “I’m the one who beat them. That puts you in danger.”<br/>She shook her head again. “That’s not true. It isn’t your fault. You only did that to protect us.”<br/>Charles insisted. “This place isn’t safe anymore. You can’t stay here.” His voice softened. “Come live with me. You can bring your tools and mechanics. It’s fine.”<br/>Sapphire hesitated, torn. “Charles, I really—”<br/>“Yay!” Tina suddenly shouted.<br/>She grabbed Amara’s hand, already bouncing with excitement. “We are going to live with Uncle Charles!”<br/>Amara laughed and nodded eagerly. “Yes, Aunt. Let’s go live with Uncle Charles.”<br/>Before Sapphire could say another word, the two of them rushed inside, to pack their luggages. <br/>Sapphire stood there for a moment, stunned.<br/>Then she let out a nervous chuckle and looked at Charles.</div>
