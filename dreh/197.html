        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div><p>Charles arrived at Natasha’s store far within a few minutes.The place was crowded with strangers.</p><p>About ten men stood scattered across the store, their presence heavy and hostile, the shelves was  pushed aside. They were already destroying some things. </p><p> At the far end, one of them had Natasha by the wrist, his grip tight enough that her fingers trembled as she tried to pull away.</p><p>“I already told you,” Natasha said, her voice shaking but firm, “I’m not selling this store.”</p><p>The man laughed . “You are making a problem out of nothing,” he said, leaning closer. “This is business. Also, we are offering a lot!”</p><p>“Let me go, i said I&#x27;m  not interested ” she snapped, twisting her arm, but his hold only tightened as he smirked.</p><p>“You got a nice ass”, He said as he grabbed it.  At that moment, he felt a hard grip on his wrist.</p><p>The man sucked in a sharp breath, surprise flashing across his face as he turned to Charles.</p><p>“Uhn?” he muttered and yelled, “Who the fuck are you?”.</p><p>“Step away from her,” Charles said, his voice flat and cold.</p><p>The man sneered. “Who do you think you—”</p><p>The sentence never finished.</p><p>Smack!.</p><p>Charles’s fist landed hard, driving straight into his face with a sound that echoed through the store. </p><p>Bone cracked, and the man stumbled back, clutching his nose as blood spilled through his fingers.</p><p>“What the hell!” he shouted, pointing wildly. “You are dead. Kill him.”</p><p>The others immediately closed in, each of them with a long baton. </p><p>Charles didn’t even flinch. </p><p>He moved through them like a storm, ducking under the first swing and slamming his elbow into a chest, then spinning and driving a kick that sent another man crashing into a shelf. </p><p>Charles drove one of them backward and hurled him into the wooden shelf with such force that the wood splintered apart, pieces flying across the floor as the man collapsed. </p><p>Another rushed him with a raised baton, but Charles caught the strike mid-swing, twisted his wrist, and brought his knee up hard, the pressure snapping the baton in half as the man screamed and dropped to the ground.</p><p>The fight barely lasted a minute.</p><p>Bodies fell one after another, groans filling the air as the men collapsed, clutching bruises and ribs.</p><p> When it ended, all ten of them were on the floor, writhing and unable to rise.</p><p>Charles stood among them, breathing heavily.</p><p>Natasha stared at him, shaken.</p><p>“Are you okay”, he asked and Natasha nodded with a smile. </p><p>The leader stood there holding his broken nose, staring at Charles.  Shock and rage twisting his face as he shrieked, “Do you even know the consequences of what you just did?”</p><p>Charles scoffed, his voice calm but sharp. “The consequences of beating you all up because you were threatening and harassing someone?”</p><p>The man spat blood to the side and shouted back, “Do you know where we are from?”</p><p>Charles tilted his head slightly. “Well, now I’m curious. Who sent you here? Tell me, so I can go and beat him up too, because forcing someone to give up their property like this is pathetic.”</p><p>The leader’s lips slowly curled into a smirk. “We are from the Trisian Syndicate.”</p><p>The name hit Charles like a wall.</p><p>His body stiffened as he raised his head up to the name. </p><p>Natasha noticed immediately. “Charles?” she asked, confused. “Who are they? Do you know them?”</p><p>Charles didn’t answer.</p><p>The leader saw the reaction and laughed softly, satisfied. “Uhn,” he said slowly. “Seems you’re not ignorant after all. You know exactly who the Trisian Syndicate is, don’t you?”</p><p>He gestured weakly around the store. “We are just the normal batch,” he continued. “So tell me, what do you think will happen if the real ones come? the meta-humans and the cultivators.”</p><p>Then his voice dropped, “And Mr. Raphael,” he said. “The almighty heir himself.”</p><p>Charles went mute as he recalled what </p><p>Lizzypie had told him just today that the Trisian Syndicate had entered the city. How ruthless they were and how they used their power to oppress.</p><p>And now, he was witnessing it. Lizzypie didn&#x27;t exaggerate at all. But why would they want to buy the store? </p><p>The leader mistook Charles’s silence for fear.</p><p>A crooked smile tugged at his swollen lips. “You see?” he said, spreading his hands. “There’s no need to make this a big deal. We are reasonable people and I understand you attacked us because you didn&#x27;t know who we were.”</p><p>He nodded toward Natasha’s store. “Just apologize for the misunderstanding and agree to sell the company. We will resolve things..”</p><p>Charles scoffed  </p><p>“We are offering a very generous compensation,” he continued. “One billion dollars. Cash.”</p><p>Charles frowned.</p><p>One billion?. Even Natasha was tense. </p><p>That number didn’t sit right. Why offer so much money just to buy this store?. Charles glanced around the store, mentally calculating. Even if they counted inside the store and the store itself,  it barely crossed 200 million. Not even close.</p><p>Yet they were offering more than double.</p><p>“For this?” Natasha said quietly, looking back at the man. “That’s a lot of money.”</p><p>The leader’s smile widened. “Exactly. You see how reasonable we are. With that money, you can even build and start another store.”</p><p>He reached into his jacket and pulled out a folded document. He stepped forward and held it out.</p><p>“A simple agreement,” he said. “Sign here. We hand over the money. You walk away and that&#x27;s it.”</p><p>Charles just stared at him.</p><p></p></div>
