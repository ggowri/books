  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's voice was tinged with disbelief as she stared at Osborne, a heavy sigh escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she no longer held any hope for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew all too well just how extraordinary Alexander was and how powerful the Paltrow family truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston, as a whole, was far superior to Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The region was home to nine ancient families, each one more formidable than the old families tied to Skyefall. Among them, the Paltrow family undoubtedly ranked in the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just considering the master-level fighters they had on their roster was enough to send shivers down anyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Alexander, only twenty-eight years old and already striving for the Class A master level, not to mention his status as the heir of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lineage, background, and talent were simply unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow, grappling with the weight of Alexander's pedigree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning more about Alexander, he felt a headache creeping in. Watching Dylan's triumphant expression, Osborne realized that even if he revealed his true identity, that he was the owner of Luna Jewelry and Skyefall Security Services and a Class B+ metahuman, it still wouldn't stack up against Alexander, unless he revealed that he was the biological grandson of the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His connection to the Godfather was his most guarded secret. If it got out, the dangers he would face would far surpass anything the Paltrow family or Alexander could throw at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight and aiming for Class A master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impressive, sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Newport City, the Augustine family had at least four prodigies who had already achieved that level at his age, far surpassing Alexander's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those very individuals would become Osborne's competitors in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his lineage as the Godfather's grandson were exposed, they would likely descend upon Skyefall in an instant, eliminating him to eliminate the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I have to keep that secret under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what is the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, suddenly recalling the reward the Godfather had just given him - the heir of the Augustine family in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander might be an heir of an old family, but so was he!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't know how the Augustine family stacked up against the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne cautiously asked, "Mr. Dylan Radcliffe, have you heard of the Augustine family in Dampston?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan paused, his gaze sharpening on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I've heard of the Augustine family. They're one of the ancient families, after all. Are you trying to tell me you're one of them?" Dylan replied, a hint of skepticism lacing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated but eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all goes as I suspect, I might indeed be part of the Augustine family, and possibly... the heir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence enveloped the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa looked at Osborne in shock, as he had never mentioned this to her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a wry smile. It wasn't that he hadn't wanted to share; he had just learned this himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Dylan hadn't pushed him so hard, he might have kept it under wraps a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan suddenly burst into laughter, the sound echoing with derision. "Ha! That's rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the heir of the Augustine family? What a joke! If memory serves, the heir was named Barry Augustine, and he just recently met his end at sea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you claiming you're the new heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Augustine family had appointed a new heir, you think they wouldn't have announced it to the world? Come on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you were the heir, what difference does it make? You must not know the situation with the Augustine family, huh? They've long since fallen from grace and are likely to be ousted from Dampston soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon enough, there may not even be an Augustine family left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for their peak, they never stood a chance against the Paltrow family. They're not even in the same league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can use this identity to make me agree to let you be with Clarissa? You're barking up the wrong tree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's gaze was full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked genuinely puzzled. He really didn't know much about the Dampston's </span><span>Augustine family, but from Dylan's words, it sounded like their strength was nowhere near the Paltrow family's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Dampston's Augustine family is in deep trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Be expelled from Dampston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather has sent me to such an underwhelming family as a successor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous heir, Barry, has just been buried at sea?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is beyond unreliable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew now that leveraging his status as the heir of the Augustine family in Dampston to win Dylan's approval for his relationship with Clarissa was no longer an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne had no other plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wouldn't give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If status wasn't enough, then he'd leave it behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Apollo, Clarissa's fianc&eacute;, seemed untouchable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was dead, and Clarissa had become his girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squeezed Clarissa's hand and looked at Dylan with determination. "Mr. Dylan Radcliffe, I admit that Alexander's status, background, and even his strength </span><span>surpass</span><span> mine right now. But there's one thing he'll never have that I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan </span><span>frowned,</span><span> his scorn evident. "And what might that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, turning to Clarissa with eyes full of affection, saying, "Clarissa loves me. No matter how outstanding Alexander is, that won't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, do you agree with me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
