  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa smiled and nodded, saying, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the wolves from the painting. I was only five at the time, truly scared as the wolves approached me. I could see the ferocity in their eyes and smell the stench from their mouths. I thought I was going to be eaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And it was at that moment, he appeared.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked down at the painting of the boy with a gentle smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;A boy appeared, dressed in tattered clothes, with a little girl around my age. He was brave and fierce, charging at the wolves, driving them away, saving me from despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He then patted my head, handed me a piece of bread, smiled gently at me, and reassured me that everything was okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;At that moment, I truly felt like he was sent from above to rescue me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Unfortunately, before I could even speak to him, he left. I was soon found by my parents and brought back. But in my mind, I could never forget that scene, and I wanted to paint it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how this painting came to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Unfortunately, I hadn&rsquo;t started learning to paint at that time, so the painting isn&rsquo;t very good.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Clarissa carefully handed the painting back to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, this painting means a lot to me. I hope you&rsquo;ll take good care of it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, however, was frozen in place, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why did Clarissa&rsquo;s description sound so much like what happened to him fifteen years ago?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only difference was that he drove away a pack of wild dogs, not wolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, even though the street in your painting looks old, it must be within a city, right? How could there be wolves in such a place?&rdquo; Wesley inquired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Embarrassed, Clarissa explained, &ldquo;I was too young to recognize wolves at the time. I just thought they looked fierce and assumed they were wolves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Later, I found out they were just a group of stray dogs.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Clarissa finished, Wesley nodded with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;For a five-year-old like Ms. Radcliffe, mistaking stray dogs for wolves is quite normal. Luckily, someone helped drive them away, or else if they had harmed you, even the heavens wouldn&rsquo;t forgive them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Osborne was completely stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He exclaimed, looking at Clarissa, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, how old are you this year?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s question surprised everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia thought it was quite impolite to ask a woman her age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, Clarissa didn&rsquo;t mind and smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty years old.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That meant the incident happened fifteen years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The timing matched up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surprised, Osborne quickly asked, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, is the location of the street in your painting in Cloudsea City?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, it was Clarissa&rsquo;s turn to be surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Osborne, asking, &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, how did you know it&rsquo;s Cloudsea City? I&rsquo;ve never told anyone the location in the painting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without answering, Osborne continued, &ldquo;Is it Morningstar Street in Cloudsea City? Near the Cloudsea Sports Arena, leading to Cloudsea Lake?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne&rsquo;s words, Clarissa&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne had only mentioned the city name, she wouldn&rsquo;t have thought much of it, as many knew she spent her childhood in Cloudsea City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Morningstar Street, such a specific address, was unknown to anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even her parents didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa gazed at Osborne, her once aloof expression now transformed into a mix of excitement and urgency. Suddenly, she leaped up, grabbing Osborne&rsquo;s arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How did you know? Please don&rsquo;t tell me you figured it out from this painting. My art skills were terrible back then, and the street I painted doesn&rsquo;t resemble Morningstar Street at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why do you know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Who are you, really?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s fervent words shocked Wesley and Ophelia, who exchanged a concerned glance, sensing something amiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of astonishment, Osborne let out a bitter chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought for a moment, then decided not to hide the truth. &ldquo;Because I was an orphan, and fifteen years ago, I happened to be in Cloudsea City, taking my sister to Morningstar Street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If I remember correctly, that day was February 2nd.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I never would have imagined that the lovely little girl, who cried in fear at the sight of stray dogs, would turn out to be you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Osborne finished speaking, Clarissa was left completely stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her frame began to tremble violently, tears welling up in her eyes and streaming down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, her grip on Osborne&rsquo;s arm only tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;February 2nd, that&rsquo;s right! It was February 2nd! It&rsquo;s you. It&rsquo;s really you. I&rsquo;ve finally found you,&rdquo; Clarissa exclaimed before suddenly throwing herself into Osborne&rsquo;s arms, holding him tightly around the neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stood there dumbfounded, his body stiff with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were equally dumbfounded, staring in disbelief at Clarissa clinging tightly to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards, too, stood there in disbelief.</p><div class="pagination">
