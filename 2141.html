  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused intently on Isidore, mapping out the steps he needed to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To draw the lightning from Umbra Earth, with my current Level Ten lightning elemental essence, I might just be able to pull it off! It won't be much&mdash;definitely not enough to harm Isidore directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's not my goal! I just need the lightning to sense Isidore's presence and take him out itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But we're deep in this cave&mdash;about 3 miles from the surface. That distance makes drawing the lightning impossible right now. I've got to reach the surface first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he considered the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three miles wasn't too far for him to cover quickly, but Isidore's attack speed was formidable. </span><span>Osborne'd</span><span> likely get hit at least once, maybe even twice, before he could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his current state, without using absolute defense, Osborne wouldn't be able to withstand a single hit, let alone two. The moment he dropped the crimson lotus form, Isidore could finish him off before he even made it back to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, a wry smile appeared on Osborne's face. He couldn't help but feel a twinge of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't give up! I have to figure out a way! If I can block two of Isidore's attacks, there's still hope for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued to wrestle with his thoughts, the only solution he could contemplate involved facing off against Isidore with the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow to unleash its strongest attack could potentially counter Isidore's first blow. But that would only buy me one shot! Isidore's speed far exceeds mine; I wouldn't stand a chance against his second strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alfreda's voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what do we do next? Are we going to survive this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone brimmed with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne in his crimson lotus form exhibited incredible defenses, she could sense his energy waning rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he couldn't maintain that state indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could perceive the warning signs, Isidore surely could as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Isidore was slow to attack&mdash;he was biding his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alfreda's fearful voice sparked something in Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute! Maybe Alfreda has a solution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly responded through their connection, "Don't worry, Alfreda! We're not going to die! I've come up with a plan to deal with Isidore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After outlining his strategy, Osborne noticed a flicker of hope in Alfreda's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized the feasibility of the plan, but it also cast a shadow of concern on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Alfreda, as it stands, I can only withstand Isidore's attack once at most! Given his speed, we'll have to weather at least two strikes to get back to the surface! Do you have any ideas about how we can block one of his attacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, he looked at Alfreda expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip, her face etched with grave seriousness. She seemed to wrestle with an internal debate until finally, she released a breath she'd been holding and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got... a trick up my sleeve!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pretty powerful one that can boost my defenses by over tenfold! I'm confident it'll hold up against one of Isidore's attacks. Sure, it comes with a price, but it'll be worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart lifted at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really do have a way! That's fantastic!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can just withstand two of Isidore's attacks, we'll make it back to the surface. Then I can summon the lightning from Umbra Earth to strike at him! Once that happens, Isidore won't be able to hide anymore; he's going to get obliterated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was starting to feel a bit of a drain on his energy. If Osborne didn't figure something out pronto, he'd lose his grip on the crimson lotus form. And without that form, his absolute defense would be out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, though, there seemed to be a chink of light at the end of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, get ready! When I drop the crimson lotus form, you stay right behind me. I'll take the first hit from Isidore, and you'll handle the second. Don't mess this up!" he instructed, his voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded with determination. "Got it! No problem!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, no matter what happens, I'm really glad to have met you and to call </span><span>you</span><span> my friend.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you better survive this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words brought a smile to his face. "Me too! Knowing you and having you as a friend means the world to me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to make it out of this together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda managed a weak smile in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together, huh? Sounds good to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was too focused on Isidore to notice the slight unease flickering across Alfreda's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore was still studying the crimson lotus form, his brow furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore muttered, his voice dripping with disdain, "What a strange thing you are!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already looking pretty weak. Keeping up this facade must be exhausting. How much longer can you hold out? You'd be better off surrendering now; you have no hope of survival in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed. "Old man, what's with the arrogance?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a bit stronger in cultivation level! Once I reach Empyrean Sacredness, squashing you will be as easy as stepping on an ant!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better kill me now, or mark my words, one day I'll take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore burst into laughter, a chilling sound that echoed in the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So cocky, even when death is knocking at your door! You think you can escape? You're dreaming! Your talent is impressive. I'll give you that. Just Ascension Three, yet you're stronger than most Ascension Seven warriors I've encountered.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even after living for over ten thousand years, I've never seen a talent like yours in the Human Community! If you could keep growing, you might just become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior one day.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could even crush me without breaking a sweat!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But guess what? You won't get that chance!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This cosmos is filled with geniuses, but very few actually make it to the top. Most of them die trying!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You'll be one of them!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It'll be quite the thrill for me to take down a talent like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened. "Old fool, you're the one who's going to be disappointed!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll never kill me, not in this lifetime!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... is someone in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum? Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly shouted, a mischievous glint in his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore's expression hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Someone's in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore turned around, scanning the area, but saw nothing. Realization hit him like a ton of bricks&mdash;he'd been tricked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he turned back, he saw Osborne had reverted from the crimson lotus form back to his human shape, already channeling interdimensional travel to make his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Isidore shouted, "You little brat! How dare you play me for a fool?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just run away?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dreaming! Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Isidore unleashed a torrent of energy aimed straight at Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
