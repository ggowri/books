  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Satan&rsquo;s Eye activated, Mark and the others&rsquo; movements slowed down. Osborne could meticulously observe each step of their attack and pinpoint the flaws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne acted swiftly, leaping out like a cheetah and delivering a punch to the person who displayed the most obvious flaw among the group of ten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man was caught off guard. Osborne&rsquo;s fist soon loomed large in his vision. Before coming back to his senses, the man was struck and sent crashing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was out, followed by the second contestant, then the third person, the fourth, and so on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thanks to The Breath of Celestial, Osborne now outclassed Class F martial artists in speed, strength, and reaction time, surpassing even those at Class E and reaching Class D.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If combined with Satan&rsquo;s Eye, his strength was not inferior to that of a Class C martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if these ten people joined forces, they would pose no threat to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite their seemingly formidable attacks, they couldn&rsquo;t lay a finger on Osborne. One by one, they were knocked down and eliminated by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In just a dozen seconds, Mark was the only one left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In shock, he soon received a blow to the ribs from Osborne, causing him to collapse and be ousted from the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne advanced to the third round of the final.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Based on his performance in the first two rounds, even if he came last in the third one, he would definitely secure a spot, possibly even clinching the top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All the contestants looked at Osborne in astonishment at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They abruptly abandoned the idea of teaching him a lesson upon realizing it was beyond their capability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was ahead of them in the first two rounds, and his fighting ability also outstripped theirs. Even if they teamed up, he might not be defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They preferred to ignore him and work hard to compete for the other four spots instead of engaging in fights with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, the following competition became easier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the end, Osborne effortlessly defeated several Class E martial artists in the final and secured first place once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the high platform, Ophelia and Wesley were stunned again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Having predicted that Osborne would be severely beaten, he felt as if he were slapped hard in the face. Another victory for Osborne caused Wesley&rsquo;s face to contort in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The happiest person was Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she did not dare to show her delight but merely nodded with a cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was somewhat helpless, thinking, <span style="font-style: italic;">I didn&rsquo;t expect him to stand out. How wonderful will it be if only his intentions toward Clarissa are purely protective? With him as Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, she will be much safer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she waved her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let the top five come up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Osborne and the other four were brought to the platform. After the three intense tests, all four were breathless and physically exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Osborne was still calm at that time, showing no sign of fatigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was also shocked about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since beginning his practice of The Breath of Celestial, he seldom felt tired, as if his body possessed boundless energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During his shooting training at the research center previously, he spent over ten hours firing tens of thousands of bullets. If it had been anyone else, they would have long collapsed from exhaustion, but Osborne remained unfazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could only attribute this to the effect of The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You surprised me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna cast a deep glance at Osborne, turned to the other four, and said, &ldquo;Congratulations to you. You&rsquo;ve successfully passed the assessment. You must be drained, so feel free to return and rest for now. Once your employment contracts with the company are signed, you can start work.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, the four people were overjoyed and quickly expressed their gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even for them, such a job with an annual salary in the millions was not always available. Most importantly, they were now bodyguards for Clarissa, the most stunning girl in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Securing this job was a tremendous honor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the four people left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Staring at Osborne again, Donna was somewhat conflicted. Considering his strength, even among Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards, he ranked above the middle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps only Paul and the three vice-captains could surpass Osborne in overall strength and experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was more than willing to have a master like Osborn on Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she was worried that Osborne harbored ulterior motives toward Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He might be a threat to Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, are you truly disregarding my earlier proposal? You must understand the grave risks of being a bodyguard. Death could come at any moment,&rdquo; Donna asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled. &ldquo;Yes. I just want to stay in the Radcliffe Manor as Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard. Now that I have passed the assessment, please fulfill your promise, Ms. Donna Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could he give up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as he became Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, his second test of heirship would be completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, he would never compromise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said coldly, &ldquo;While you did pass the strength test, one crucial aspect remains. Your background check is still pending approval.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
