  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne spoke up, "Darren, from today onward, you and your group will appear as members of Spark of Blaze, but secretly, you'll all be part of the Blood Demon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spark of Blaze may one day become a force for the entire Human Community, but the Blood Demon members will only take orders from me. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren looked up, determination shining in his eyes. "Understood! Darren is at your command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spark of Blaze was nothing more than a spontaneous creation of his, aimed at changing the dire situation of the Human Community in Wild Flame City. He didn't intend to invest too much time or energy into it; once Spark of Blaze could run on its own, he would step back from the role of leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Blood Demon members were his sharpest weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity soon, so I can bring out those 48 hundred Blood Demon members from the Dimensional Microcosm to help me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But first, I have to deal with the Keynes family and the Wolfe family. I need Spark of Blaze to solidify its position in Wild Flame City before I can focus on Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne beckoned Darren and the others to follow him out of the training room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, Betty and the others were anxiously waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew Osborne was attempting to heal Darren and his team. Although they all thought that the injuries sustained by Darren and the others were too severe to be healed, deep down, they still secretly held on to a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they saw Osborne emerge, flanked by Darren and the others, they rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Pollitt, you... you..." Betty stammered, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren smiled, "Thanks to the Boss' treatment, we're all back on our feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, over five thousand warriors stepped forward, their energy radiating powerfully, overwhelming Betty and the others with intense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all healed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a late-stage Deity Overlord, one hundred twenty-eight Celestial Deities, and the rest Transcendent Deities, the sheer force was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow!" Betty gasped, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of power was this? The strength of Darren and his team had surpassed most of the major factions in Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the top forces among the three Upper Races living on the floating mountains could rival them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift..." Betty looked at Osborne with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand. "Betty, let's save the chatter for later! The fact that Darren and his crew are back in fighting shape is fantastic news for Spark of Blaze! You've done a great job these past few days, so you'll continue as one of the vice leaders of Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But first, we need to deal with the Wolfe family and the Keynes family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They dare to attack Spark Estate? Do they think we're pushovers? If they want to step up, let's make them our first target to establish Spark of Blaze's reputation in Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face hardened with determination, and the atmosphere among the members of Spark of Blaze crackled with excitement and resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a violent tremor shook the divine power barrier enveloping Spark Estate as powerful attacks slammed against it, bursting forth in a dazzling display of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Fabian and Gilbert, two Deity Overlord warriors attacking!" Betty exclaimed urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, already aware of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the front gates of Spark Estate, two imposing figures were relentlessly bombarding the divine power barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them was a familiar face&mdash;Fabian, the Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other, looking even stronger than Fabian, was none other than Gilbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. "Just two early-stage Deity Overlords. Darren, keep your team hidden and ready for battle. I'll go see what they want. Wait for my signal before you engage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Betty, you and the others, come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne strode confidently toward the estate's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty felt a ripple of concern wash over her. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, are we really going out there? Isn't it a bit too dangerous? I think it would be better if Mr. Pollitt accompanied us. After all, Fabian and Gilbert are both Deity Overlord warriors, and I worry they might turn on us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand dismissively, cutting off her anxious words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! Bring Darren along? What if we scare them off? I'm not afraid of them striking first; it's their hesitation that worries me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he reached the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty bit her lip, torn between her fears and her loyalty. In the end, she decided to trust him and quickly followed behind Osborne with Thera and Sophia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they approached, Osborne raised his hand, and a small portal opened in the divine power barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stepped through with an air of calm confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian and Gilbert, lost in their furious onslaught, were caught off guard when they noticed someone emerging from the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their surprise quickly morphed into recognition as they saw Osborne, along with Betty and her sisters. Their eyes lit up with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, well, you lowly human, finally decided to come out, huh? Running low on Essence Crystals?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
