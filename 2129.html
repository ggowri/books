  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment that Satan's Eye broke through to Sacredness Level, Osborne felt as if the world around him had transformed entirely. Everything became astonishingly clear; it was as though nothing could obstruct his vision anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even several hundred miles away, he could see the corrosive bubbles emerging from the depths of the marsh with crystal clarity, observing the subtle ripples on their surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyesight had enhanced to an unbelievable degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just his vision that improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, if he wished, he could perceive everything in front of him as a three-dimensional diagram. He could analyze the energy properties of objects, the direction, and speed of energy flow&mdash;everything was laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused on the corrosive bubbles rising slowly from the marsh, and without needing to touch them, he could directly analyze the gas inside. He could determine its corrosive potency, temperature, concentration, and even predict when it would explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extraordinary sensation, as if everything in the world had been digitized and transformed into data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the instant a corrosive bubble burst, Osborne concentrated, and the partially exploded bubble suddenly came to a halt, freezing the surrounding environment in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the time of the corrosive bubble had been locked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time power he wielded was a gift from Satan's Eye. Now that it had reached Sacredness Level, his time power had also surged to an incredible level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze extended further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he spotted his one hundred twenty-sixth clone over </span><span>six</span><span> </span><span>hundred miles away, engaged in a fierce battle with several Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was intense, but to Osborne, it unfolded in slow motion. He could see every opening, every movement of energy within the Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, he solidified the time around the group of Mud Golems, rendering them immobile in their previous actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, his clone unleashed a flurry of attacks, effortlessly dispatching the Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those Mud Golems are equivalent to Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings, but even from over </span><span>six</span><span> </span><span>hundred miles away, I can use Satan's Eye's time power to freeze their movements, leaving them unable to break free for a short period."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that the breakthrough to Sacredness Level would not only enhance his vision dramatically but also significantly boost his time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only downside was that his Spatial Clones didn't seem to benefit from the effects </span><span>of the Sacredness Level Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could use the abilities of Satan's Eye, but only at the peak Level Ten effectiveness, not the upgraded Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial Clones really do have limitations! The effects of Sacredness Level Satan's Eye are beyond their capacity to handle! If my space elemental essence also breaks through to Sacredness Level, I fear the Spatial Clones won't be able to utilize it either; they'll be stuck with just the peak Level Ten effects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne felt a twinge of regret, but he also recognized the logic behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his Spatial Clones could harness both the powers of Sacredness Level Satan's Eye and the Sacredness Level space elemental essence, that would be downright terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were intrinsic limits to the power of Spatial Clones, and they were already approaching those limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shifted his gaze from the deep marsh below to its murky expanse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the breakthrough to Sacredness Level, he could only glimpse about over 150 feet into the depths, but now, it felt like his vision pierced through to the very heart of the marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That marsh was over ten thousand yards deep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in the heart of the marsh, there was a menacing undercurrent of corrosive gas. The corrosive bubbles that dotted the swamp's surface were tell-tale signs of this gas seeping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This vast expanse of corrosive gas was a ticking time-bomb. If it were to burst forth, it was feared that the entire Umbra Earth continent would turn into a desolate and deadly wasteland. Every single thing on the Umbra Earth would be corroded into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Ascension Seven and Ascension Eight Supernal Deity Kings wouldn't stand a chance of surviving on this land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's eyes suddenly lit up, his face contorted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw was truly astonishing. Beneath the layer of corrosive gas, there was a thick, jet-black rock formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within this rock layer, there were countless glistening specks of crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! It's a Sacred Crystal vein!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy surged through him as he realized he had discovered a vein of Sacred Crystals at the marsh's deepest point&mdash;an untold treasure just waiting to be mined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at all those Sacred Crystals! There must be at least ten thousand of them! No, surely even more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement was palpable, but it quickly morphed into concern. The Sacred Crystal vein was completely obscured by corrosive gases, and to extract the crystals, he'd first have to traverse that suffocating cloud of corrosiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an Ascension Eight or Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King would meet an untimely end if they ventured into those toxic fumes; the gas was that powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current abilities, even with his Infinite Sacred Body, which granted him a Sacredness Level physique, and when combined with Sacred Power to don Eclipse War Armor and </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Armor for maximum defense, he would still likely be overwhelmed by those dense fumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, eyeing the trove of Sacred Crystals that were completely out of reach. It felt maddening to stand before an overflowing treasure vault while being unable to take even a single piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I have to figure out how to get those Sacred Crystals! With this many, I could easily raise my cultivation level to Ascension Ten or possibly even reach Sacredness Level! I won't ever have to worry about Sacred Crystals again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with greed as he pondered his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried extending his spatial energy toward the Sacred Crystal vein, but it was useless; the corrosive gas simply corroded his spatial energy before it could reach its destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such terrifying gases! They can erode even my spatial energy!" Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my powers can't bypass the corrosive fumes, then I can't harvest the crystals from a distance. And as for my body&mdash;there's no way it could withstand those toxins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only my space elemental essence could also break through to Sacredness Level! Then I might be able to penetrate those fumes and harvest the Sacred Crystals from afar&mdash;or even transport myself safely to the vein itself.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, I'm just stuck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What other options do I have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, he continued to mull it over, his gaze fixated on the gleaming Sacred Crystal vein, unrestrained yearning glinting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then something strange happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye emitted a burst of soft purple ocular energy that shot forward with incredible speed, piercing through the ten thousand yards of marsh and seamlessly cutting through the vicious corrosive gas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy landed precisely on the Sacred Crystal vein.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, every last Sacred Crystal within that vein vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were consumed by the ocular energy of Satan's Eye!</span></p><div class="pagination">
