The match earlier is not a big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, however, looked serious and said earnestly, "I am not kidding. A vow made is a vow to keep. Henceforth, I'll serve you. Should you require anything, you need only </span><span>call upon me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated but kept silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, he held Nathan in high regard. Despite his fiery temperament, Nathan's straightforwardness and honesty shone through, secluding him from being evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie chimed in as her cheeks were tinged with a delicate blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shall remain my brother. If you ever need anything, you know where to find me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she demurely lowered her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed and nodded. "Rest assured. I'll seek your aid when the need arises. And from now on, I shall address you as Queen, as everyone else does."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie froze in surprise before a smile bloomed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shifted his attention to Kaden and Ryan, particularly the latter. Though Ryan avoided direct eye contact, any action of Osborne was never lost on Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden offered with a polite bow, his eyes sparkling with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan followed suit, but his smile was betrayed by the coldness and reluctance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization startled Osborne, yet he masked his reaction with a smile. "Let's not stand on ceremony. By age, you're all my seniors. It would be more fitting for me to address you as cousins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan interjected firmly, "As the heir of the Augustine family, you are the beacon of our generation. Regardless of age, you lead us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simply call us by our names. We need to call you Mr. Augustine, but addressing you by your name feels more endearing. Henceforth, Queen and I shall address you by your name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback but nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. I'm feeling a bit fatigued today and wish to retire. You should all go, and we'll converse again when the time is right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan replied with a carefree smile, taking his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden and Ryan departed as well, leaving Queenie behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her with puzzlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, allow me to escort you to your residence. I also wish to visit your sister, Yulissa," Queenie proposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne echoed with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was surprised and asked, "You're unaware? Yulissa is your biological sister, the daughter of Allen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced. "My nominal father, Allen, had a daughter named Yulissa Augustine? This meant I had a sister by blood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian hadn't mentioned this either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was unreliable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inwardly chastised Brian's unreliability and quickly explained, "My childhood memories are hazy. I don't recall having a younger sister at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Naturally! Yulissa wasn't born when you went missing. She turned eighteen this year. Your mother gave birth to her three years after your disappearance. Sadly, complications during childbirth claimed your mother's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, fearing any words might reveal his ignorance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he inquired, "Queen, if Yulissa is my biological sister, why didn't she come to welcome me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was very curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie turned somber and sighed. "Yulissa was injured. After your father's unexpected demise at sea, Yulissa was inconsolable. She insisted on boarding the cruise ship to uncover the truth behind his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ship encountered pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though the escort team valiantly protected her, she sustained severe injuries. She has been in recovery since."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. Let's head back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the discomfort stirred by the sudden revelation of a "sister", Osborne accepted the reality of her existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Queenie led Osborne to a seaside villa, formerly the residence of Allen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Allen's passing and Osborne's newfound status as his son, it was only fitting that Osborne resided there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie knocked on the door, which was opened by a middle-aged woman who appeared to be a nanny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Queenie Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman greeted Osborne and Queenie respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is Mary, who is here to care for Yulissa," Queenie explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a polite smile. "There's no need for such formality, Mary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my duty, Mr. Augustine. Your room has been prepared. Please inspect it and let me know if anything is amiss or if it does not meet your satisfaction. I will rectify any issues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was spacious, yet its decor lacked the opulence of Clarissa's manor, a clear indication of the Augustine family's financial struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to see Yulissa!" Queenie exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed up to the second floor, with Osborne closely following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, too, was eager to meet his biological sister, hoping she wouldn't prove to be too challenging.</span></p><div class="pagination">
