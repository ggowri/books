  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Cosmic Translocator was fixed, Osborne let Azael and the others in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's do this together. Each time the Cosmic Translocator is activated, it consumes a certain amount of Sacred Crystal. If we teleport together, we can save some Sacred Crystal," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael and the others were instantly delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued, "Everyone, you don't need to provide the Sacred Crystal required to activate the Cosmic Translocator, but please do me a favor and don't tell anyone about what happened here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's gaze swept over everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He killed six advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors from Cobalt Island, along with dozens of mid and primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, but the island master of Cobalt Island was not among them, only a deputy island master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that if word of this got out, the island master of Cobalt Island would definitely come seeking revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne was not afraid, he didn&rsquo;t want to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he felt it necessary to remind these people to help keep it a secret. Once he found the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescued his parents, he would leave Stellar Region M72 immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the island master of Cobalt Island would have nowhere to seek revenge on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt the threat in Osborne's gaze and immediately felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was asking them to keep it a secret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was nothing to them, and they didn&rsquo;t want trouble either, so they all agreed and promised not to reveal anything about this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally nodded. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the Cosmic Translocator was fully activated. Everyone disappeared from the resource-bearing planet. After a moment of dizziness, Osborne finally felt solid ground under his feet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the situation outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Wind here was even stronger, indicating they were closer to the edge of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Inferno Planet," Angela said. "Stellar Region M72 is a desolate Stellar Region, with hardly any life-bearing planets and very few intelligent beings. Inferno Planet is the only large life-bearing planet in Stellar Region M72, but its size is only about one percent of Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fortunately, Inferno Planet has decent resources, which attracted several surrounding Stellar Regions to settle and develop here. Additionally, those Stellar Exploration Organizations and Space Pirates also use Inferno Planet as a place for trade and rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, most of them are in the northern hemisphere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The northern hemisphere of Inferno Planet is filled with various Stellar Exploration Organizations, Space Pirates, Stellar Region fugitives, and dark forces, making it extremely chaotic and dangerous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela quickly introduced Osborne to the situation on Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it was her first time on Inferno Planet as well; everything she knew was gathered by the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Inferno Planet is only one percent the size of Racial Convergence Planet, it is still immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were in a bustling city in the southern hemisphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And there are thousands of such bustling cities on Inferno Planet, most of which are in the southern hemisphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The northern hemisphere has only one mega city, and that is Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned at this moment, silently pondering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frenetic Storm Warband visited Inferno Planet six months ago and rested in Vice City. Let's head straight to Vice City; hopefully, we can still find some clues," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela hesitated for a moment. "Osborne, Vice City is very dangerous. There are no rules there, only chaos and killing. It's a haven for Space Pirates and Stellar Region criminals. I think we shouldn't risk it ourselves. We can pay some local forces on Inferno Planet to investigate for us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We just need to wait here for the news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and nodded. "Alright. Let's find a place to settle down first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other two walked out of the Cosmic Translocator. Azael and the others quickly bid them farewell and left in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't mind and quickly found a place to stay called Emberveil Haven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Settling down in the small courtyard of Emberveil Haven, Angela said, "Osborne, according to the intelligence from Racial Convergence Planet, this Emberveil Haven is run by a top-tier local Second-rate Power, Thorned Veil. Thorned Veil is quite strong, and its leader is an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior, holding a high status on Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Thorned Veil takes on some intelligence-gathering tasks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we're willing to pay, they'll surely be happy to help us investigate clues about the Frenetic Storm Warband in Vice City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Fairy Moon Sect is strong, when it comes to investigating the situation on Inferno Planet, it definitely can't compare to the local power Thorned Veil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Working with Thorned Veil is the fastest way to find clues about the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne and the other two found the senior members of Emberveil Haven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, an Elder from Thorned Veil appeared outside their small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a warrior of advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the courtyard, he looked at Osborne and the other two and said, "Let me introduce myself. I am an Elder of Thorned Veil, named Quincy Healy. Are you the ones looking to purchase information?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and repeated the request.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quincy immediately frowned. "Investigate the Frenetic Storm Warband's traces in Vice City? Finding out where the Frenetic Storm Warband is now, that's a bit tricky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Though Thorned Veil is considered a major force on Inferno Planet, we rarely go to Vice City. After all, you know, that place is swarming with Space Pirates and Stellar Region fugitives, almost all desperate outlaws."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we enter Vice City, we're likely to be attacked, and one careless move could cost us our lives."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Angela exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Quincy. "Quincy, we know it's tough, so our reward is generous. A total of one million Sacred Crystals, with three hundred thousand as a deposit here. Once we get the exact information about the Frenetic Storm Warband, we'll pay the remaining seven hundred thousand Sacred Crystals as the balance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quincy's eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One million Sacred Crystals was already a lot. They only needed to investigate some information, and this price was sincere enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still hesitated, continuing to talk about the dangers of Vice City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out another Dimensional Bag and said coldly, "Two million Sacred Crystals, this is my final offer. If you're still not satisfied, then forget it. Inferno Planet isn't the only place Thorned Veil sells information. I believe two million Sacred Crystals is enough to tempt many forces to send people to investigate Vice City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you agree, these six hundred thousand Sacred Crystals will be the deposit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't agree, we'll leave immediately and find someone else to cooperate with."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne stared at Quincy, waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quincy's eyes lit up instantly. He quickly took the Dimensional Bag and said with a smile, "Two million Sacred Crystals are worth sending someone to take the risk. We'll take this task."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, we need to agree first. We will send at least three teams of investigators to Vice City. If we find results, you must immediately pay the remaining 1.4 million Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If no results are found, we won't refund the deposit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I don't have much time, so you need to hurry."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem." Quincy immediately went to make arrangements, leaving Osborne and the other two to wait patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela's device started ringing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her eyes lit up. She said to Osborne, "Osborne, Ms. Alba has sent all the information about the Cosmic Translocator. Please check it out."</span></p><div class="pagination">
