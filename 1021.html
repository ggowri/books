  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and carefully take the Crystal of Life out from the glass container.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought its vitality would be hard to harness, just like the divine power from the Divine Bone Crystal, which needed special methods for absorption. But to his astonishment, it was far easier than he imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vitality within the Crystal of Life flooded into him effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of vitality ran through his body, </span><span>wraping</span><span> him in immense comfort and pleasure, as if every cell in his body were opening wide, spilling out vitality like an overflowing fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt energized; even some of his hidden injuries vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were wounded now, he wouldn't have needed to rely on the Light of Redemption. With such powerful vitality flowing through him, he could heal swiftly on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne also noted that this vitality didn't seem to enhance his overall strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, the vitality in the Crystal of Life can't boost my power level. It mainly restores vitality, especially when injured. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a Crystal of Life means rapid recovery&mdash;almost like getting an extra life or two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered the function of the Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vitality contained within a single Crystal was incredibly dense, roughly equivalent to all the vitality of a top-tier Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a magnitude of vitality that could surpass even a Class AAA warrior by dozens of times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a Class AAA warrior suffered a fatal injury, with the help of a Crystal of Life, they could bounce back quickly. One Crystal could help a Class AAA warrior recover from a deadly wound at least ten times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of hope glinted in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The last battle against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> claimed nearly four hundred members of the Blood Demon. The losses were huge, most of them killed by Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those fighters had Crystals of Life, their vitality could've been topped off, potentially saving lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought igniting his resolve, Osborne decided that every member of the Blood Demon should be equipped with a Crystal of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be on the front lines in the fight against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, facing off against hundreds and thousands of Class S clones and countless regular clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most trained and coordinated warriors would face injuries in combat. If equipped with Crystals of Life, their casualties could be significantly reduced, while their combat effectiveness would be greatly boosted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could fight without the fear of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked urgently, "Mr. Mirante, how many Crystals of Life do we have left in the warehouse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, we have about 10,000 Crystals of Life in stock!" Antonio replied quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned in surprise. "Only 10,000?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group controlled over 100 rare metal mines, each one producing roughly 50 Crystals of Life annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant, in a year alone, they should be yielding at least 5000 crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>100 seemed like a lot, but it just two years' production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that the Draco Group had been mining these rare metals for at least 40 years, the total output should have exceeded 200,000 crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of those crystals were sold off as ordinary rubies, often of low quality, at bargain prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, asking, "Weren't we supposed to trace and buy them back? Why do </span><span>we only have 10,000?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Antonio's expression turned troubled as he answered, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I'm not entirely sure about the details of the buyback process. You'd best ask the sales department head about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Get her in here, now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Kristen Helberg, the head of the sales department at the Draco Group, rushed in. In her fifties, she had the youthful appearance of someone in her thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, skipping the greetings, jumped straight into the question. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kristen, how&rsquo;s the buyback of the Crystal of Life going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A worried look crossed Kristen's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I've been handling the buyback of the red gems, no, the Crystal of Life. We've reached out secretly to every customer who's purchased them, offering to buy them back at ten times their original value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the results have been disappointing. So far, we've managed to buy back less than one-tenth of what we sold&mdash;around 20,000 pieces. They haven't even been stored in the warehouse yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"20,000? That means we still have a total of 30,000!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief escaped him; gaining back 20,000 pieces wasn't nothing. But considering the 200,000 sold, it was little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Why so few? Is it a matter of pricing? If so, let's increase the offer! Whatever it takes, we have to buy them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For today&rsquo;s Osborne, money was nothing but a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Crystal of Life? The more, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had an uneasy feeling that the League of Divine Descent was aimed for the Crystal of Life in securing rare metals mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Crystal of Life definitely had other uses besides healing injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, it's not just a matter of money..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
