  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's plan was straightforward. Using his spatial power and the Eclipsing Mantra, he intended to stealthily approach the seven peak Deity Overlord Deathborns alongside Diana and launch a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went according to plan, he was confident he could take down one Deathborn, while Diana would likely be able to severely wound another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would leave them with just five peak Deity Overlord Deathborns. With Diana holding two of them at bay, Osborne believed he could dispatch the remaining three in short order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all went well, they could eliminate the seven Deathborns and quickly harvest the three Miracle Elixirs before Angelo and his team even had a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no plan survived contact with the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had thought that with his current spatial power and the Eclipsing Mantra to mask his energy signature, the peak Deity Overlord Deathborn wouldn't detect his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he and Diana were closing in on the Deathborn, the humanoid stone figure suddenly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of energy erupted from the stone, sweeping across the entire platform. Osborne was stunned to find that his spatial power had inexplicably failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was supposed to be a stealthy ambush turned into a very public reveal as he and Diana materialized right in front of the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, staring in disbelief at the stone figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had thought it was just an oddly shaped rock, completely unaware of its true nature. Who would have guessed that it could unleash such a force that disrupted his spatial power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence was already at Level Seven, a feat typically reserved for Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even other Deity Kings, without special means, wouldn't be able to force him out of parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was this strange stone, doing just that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that as long as he was within a certain distance of the stone, he wouldn't be able to enter parallel space or perform interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This humanoid stone is trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's likely not just an ordinary rock but a terrifying divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sparked a glimmer of realization in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to ponder further. The seven kneeling Deity Overlord Deathborns, now aware of Osborne and Diana's presence, erupted in furious roars and charged at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, watch out!" Osborne called, his expression hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their ambush thwarted, they had no choice but to face the Deathborn head-on. There was no way he could abandon those three Miracle Elixirs, nor could he leave that mysterious stone behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to secure them, no matter what!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne shouted, unleashing his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him crackled with terrifying spatial energy as he prepared for the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched a punch infused with the power of Space Collapse, causing the very fabric of space to convulse violently in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was akin to a nuclear explosion, erupting from his fist and slamming into the chest of the fastest-charging Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a peak Deity Overlord Deathborn couldn't withstand the full force of Osborne's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Diana, he had reached the status of a Quasi-Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have still been lacking in the realm, but in terms of Divine Body and elemental essence, he had already met and even surpassed the Deity King's standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was not just a Celestial Deity but a Quasi-Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single punch, Osborne obliterated one of the Deity Overlord peak Deathborn, reducing its body to nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no sooner had he celebrated this moment of victory than four more Deathborns surged toward him, their faces twisted with rage, devoid of any fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They charged at him recklessly, like mindless killers consumed by their thirst for blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded and on the defensive, Osborne felt the pressure mounting as the four Deity Overlord peak Deathborns unleashed a relentless flurry of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his skills, he struggled to keep up, dodging and blocking as best as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was only in the mid-stage of Celestial Deity and was momentarily overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Diana was in a similarly precarious position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was in the late stage of Deity Overlord, taking on two peak-class Deity Overlords was pushing her limits. She was holding her ground, but the tide was not in her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the fierce battle at the center began to draw the attention of Angelo and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression darkened as he sensed the commotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? That direction... It's where the Miracle Elixirs are! How can there be a battle there? With such intense fluctuations, could it be that a third party is trying to snatch the Miracle Elixirs away from us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a chill through him, and he scoffed in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Edison, I'll handle the Deathborn army here! I'll carve a path for you. You need to get your team across and grab those Miracle Elixirs immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
