  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne led Primordial and Flash outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On his left shoulder was Drum, and on his right shoulder was Primordial. But unfortunately, Drum could see Primordial, while Primordial couldn&rsquo;t see Drum at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial asked, "Osborne, what exactly happened just now? Why did it suddenly end? Where is Drum of Empress Kira?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and asked, "Primordial, you can steal part of the memory from other World Tree offshoots, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Yes. Most of my memories are actually stolen. Among the other World Tree offshoots, some have already become the cosmos' top warriors, so they know a lot about the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I stole their memories, which is why I know so much. Otherwise, I might not know more than you. After all, I was just born not long ago and have always stayed on Celestara Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded seriously and said, "So, can other World Tree offshoots also steal your memories? You know about Drum of Empress Kira. Doesn't that make us very dangerous now? You know so many of my secrets. If they steal your memories, wouldn't I be in great danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Primordial was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he quickly said, "So that's what you're worried about. You don't need to worry because other World Tree offshoots can't steal my memories."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among the nine World Tree offshoots, I was the last to be born. I could only steal the memories of other World Tree offshoots at the time of my birth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, the second-born World Tree offshoot can only steal the memories of the first-born World Tree offshoot, while the third-born World Tree offshoot can only steal the memories of the second-born and the first-born World Tree offshoots."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was the last to be born, so they can't steal my memories."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile, "I see. You gave me a scare. I almost thought about killing you just now to make sure you kept the secret forever."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes, knowing Osborne was joking. "So, you don't have to worry about me spilling your secret now. Can you tell me what just happened? Why did we suddenly have to leave? What about the Drum of Empress Kira?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate this time and explained everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening, Primordial was completely stunned. "Empress Kira didn't completely die? Her consciousness still lives in the Drum of Empress Kira? She used all her power to create a descendant, giving birth to a daughter? And her daughter chose you to be her dad?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a pause, Primordial said in disbelief, "Most importantly, the Drum of Empress Kira is now inside your body?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "That's how it is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, this Dimensional Microcosm also belongs to the Drum. These Ice Beetles and the Silver Beetles in Empyrean Sacredness are all pets raised by the Drum. The Drum's horn can purify their bodies and help them break through racial limits. The Silver Beetles in Empyrean Sacredness are not their ultimate form. They can further evolve into Golden Beetles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was stunned again and said, "Purify the body and break through racial limits? The Drum is amazing! Where is the Drum? Hand her over and let her purify my body too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Primordial a bit anxious, Osborne pointed to his left shoulder and said calmly, "The Drum is right here. However, the Drum is currently in its infancy, so you can't see her. No creature can see her or harm her. Unless she trusts you and willingly wants you to see her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Primordial looked at Osborne's left shoulder. Sure enough, Primordial saw nothing, not even the slightest energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt Osborne was teasing him, but Primordial knew Osborne couldn't be that bored and was certain the Drum was indeed there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Primordial smiled and said in that direction, "Drum, hello. I am your dad's best friend. You can call me Primordial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you let me see you? Drum is the most obedient and beautiful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, he noticed that Osborne's left shoulder still had nothing on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum was looking at Osborne in confusion. "Dad, can this little tree man's words be trusted?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Primordial is an offshoot of the World Tree and indeed my best friend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay." Drum nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, she appeared in front of Primordial and said to him, "Primordial, hello, I am Drum."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing Drum, Primordial's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Drum looks exactly as Osborne described, with eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, a horn, and sharp mandibles&mdash;truly extraordinary. Is this Empress Kira's daughter?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Primordial smiled and said, "Drum, hello. You look truly unique."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, you look unique too," Drum said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was a bug, the other a tree&mdash;both were indeed unique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Primordial started talking with Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not intervene with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum had been around for a long time. However, apart from those Silver Beetles, she had hardly met anyone else or made any friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Drum and Primordial could get along well, it would be a good thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Flash...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Flash, like Drum, was newly born and still in infancy, Flash couldn't speak and could only manage the simplest communication.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Flash was an Astralwreck Dragon, more interested in battles and not very interested in Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne told Flash that all the Ethereal Blooms here belonged to Drum, and Flash must get Drum's permission before eating any Ethereal Blooms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Flash joined the conversation too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear that Flash was trying hard to please Drum, fearing that Drum might not allow him to eat the Ethereal Blooms here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so young, yet you've already learned to flatter others." Osborne shook his head, feeling quite helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Primordial, Flash, and Drum around him were not ordinary creatures, and they were all a bit unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne left this Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he stood at the cave entrance, and there wasn't a single Ice Beetle outside anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Ice Beetles in the entire glacier region had already entered this Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum waved his hand. Then, the cave entrance disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Dimensional Microcosm had been taken away by Drum. Without Drum's permission, no one could enter it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Osborne could enter it freely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides that, Primordial and Flash, who had just amused Drum, also gained access to the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored them and looked into the distance, murmuring, "Leroy and Clara are still waiting for me. I need to find them first, distribute the spoils, and then figure out how to kill the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne moved swiftly and appeared the next second at the place where Clara and Leroy were hiding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, both of them breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate and immediately threw out two Dimensional Bags, saying, "These are your spoils."</span></p><div class="pagination">
