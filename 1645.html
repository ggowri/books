  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who knew there'd be so many folks willing to risk their necks and join us for this mission?" Osborne exchanged a glance with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without saying a word, they both stepped into a quiet corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others seemed to steer clear of Diana, leaving the two of them feeling somewhat out of place amid the gathering crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice cut through the tension; it belonged to the only mid-stage Deity Overlord in the group. "Alright, everyone is here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I believe everyone is clear on our mission's objective. We're headed to Divine Peak Nine, specifically to the Celestial Crystal mine number 02!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, as most of you may have heard, this site has a dark reputation. There was once a Deity King who led an expedition here with dozens of Deity Overlords and a handful of skilled miners. In the end, only two people made it back, and the Deity King himself returned gravely injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced briefly at Diana as he continued, "So, let's not sugarcoat it&mdash;this mission will be perilously dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since everyone here volunteered, I assume you're not afraid of death, but being fearless doesn't mean you should go looking for trouble. I suggest we select a team leader before we head out, someone to unify us all. Because only by working together can we increase our chances of returning alive to claim those hefty rewards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scanned the faces in the group. "Anyone interested in taking the lead? Feel free to nominate yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Algernon Marley, you hold the highest rank, and your strength outshines the rest. As the only mid-stage Deity Overlord, you'd be our best choice for captain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely! Mr. Algernon Marley, the role is yours!" shouted several voices in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agree!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon smiled modestly, "I appreciate your confidence in me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then turned to Osborne and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And what about you two? Any thoughts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied indifferently, "I've got no objections. If you want to lead, then go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded in agreement. "I'm fine with it as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fantastic!" Algernon nodded vigorously. "Since everyone feels I should take charge, I won't turn down the opportunity. I've been to Divine Peak Nine twice before, so I do have some experience. I'll do my utmost to ensure we complete this exploration safely and return with those rewards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Mr. Algernon Marley at the helm, our chances of success just shot up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon waved his hands, acknowledging the praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then looked over at Diana and said calmly, "Diana, I've heard about you. You're with the Wild Flame Army, and it seems there are whispers that you're cursed. Many say joining you on this expedition is a death sentence. But I'm not one to buy into curses; I trust in my own abilities, which is why I'm here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, even though I'm skeptical about curses, it's wise to be cautious. Therefore, I need you to keep your distance from the rest of the group. Is that okay with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana frowned at this but ultimately nodded. "I can stay at the back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon appeared pleased with her willingness to cooperate, and the others seemed satisfied as well, wearing smiles that masked their unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staying at the back didn't necessarily mean safety, as all of them knew too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a typical exploration team, the most dangerous position wasn't at the front but rather at the rear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deathborn at Divine Peak Nine had a clever and strategic mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they spotted an exploration team, they usually wouldn't launch a reckless attack on the front runners. Instead, they would wait until the team was sufficiently distracted before striking at the ones lagging behind, allowing them to pick off the weakest links without raising alarms until it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In general, the Deathborn would choose to lay low, waiting for the bulk of the exploration team to move on before launching a sudden ambush on those left trailing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This tactic ensured that the front runners had less time to react. Even if the Deathborn's sneak attack didn't succeed, they could swiftly escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Consequently, those at the end of the line were far more exposed to danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's offer to take the rear position was met with approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great! Now, let's establish our formation! I'm the team leader, so I can either lead from the front to scout ahead or take a position in the middle to lend support as needed. It all depends on what you guys prefer!" Algernon announced, his voice steady and authoritative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Algernon Marley, you should definitely take the lead! You know Divine Peak Nine better than anyone. Plus, being in front allows you to help those in the middle, while..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the group shot a disparaging glance at Osborne and Diana. "While the back doesn't really matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're just from the Human Community; we don't need to worry about them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the majority chimed in, pushing for Algernon to take the lead, he accepted their decision without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The formation was set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they took a moment for introductions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon, leader of ten thousand from the Inferno Army, hailed from Inferno City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Inferno Army was the strongest of the four divisions in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In total, there were 30 in the exploration team, with an impressive 15 coming from the Inferno Army&mdash;essentially half the squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, eight were from the Thunderwind Army and five from the Firestorm Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne and Diana represented the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon declared, his voice ringing with determination, "Let's hope we all make it out of Divine Peak Nine alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get moving!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
