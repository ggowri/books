  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne unleashed his Thunder Power with a flourish, summoning a barrage of terrifying lightning dragons to strike at the group surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These peak Celestial Deities, once so confident as they charged forward, found their defenses shattered in an instant. Despite their Malevolence Amulets, designed to withstand a deadly blow, they were utterly helpless against the ferocity of Osborne's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lightning dragons struck with devastating force, a multi-pronged attack that detonated on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One moment, a dozen fierce warriors were screaming in fury; the next, they were nothing but lifeless husks, reduced to ashes and charred remains scattered across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The convulsion of energy lit up the gloom like a fireworks display, but the horror of it was undeniable. Only the two early-stage Deity Overlords managed to survive the blast; their defenses crumbled, and their amulets were rendered useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They lay on the ground, blackened and singed, struggling for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes mirrored disbelief and fear, encapsulating the shock of their rapid downfall. In a heartbeat, the tide had turned. Just moments ago, they had been in a frenzy, seeking vengeance for Emmett; now, they were gasping for air, while Osborne stood unscathed, the embodiment of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was rooted in place, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at Osborne, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments ago, she'd felt hopeless, convinced that Osborne was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But here he was, effortlessly vanquishing his attackers with staggering ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sheer magnitude of his power was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the depths of that underground lair, besides Osborne and Diana, only three others remained capable of fighting&mdash;Riley lost in meditation, and the two guards&mdash;peak Celestial Deities&mdash;standing watch beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze zeroed in on them, and the two Celestial Deity guards felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We need to wake Mr. Riley Raglan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's our only hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, they rushed toward Riley, desperate to rouse him from his trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley, clutching the Ultimate Essence Crystal, was deep in meditation, unknowingly oblivious to the chaos unfurling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the overwhelming surge of power crashing through the air, he seemed untouched by the commotion; his brow furrowed as the energy around him fluctuated dangerously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, recognized the signs instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley was trapped in a delusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meditation so close to reaching Divine Peak Nine could enhance his comprehension and absorb crystal energy at an accelerated rate, but it came with dire risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One misstep, and he could fall into a nightmarish state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The higher one's realm, the more susceptible one became to hallucinations. If Riley didn't wake up in time, he could suffer severe mental damage&mdash;perhaps even lose his grip on sanity entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he began his meditation, Riley had instructed Emmett to wake him after ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, that time had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone were to rouse him now, he might still recover&mdash;if only Osborne would allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the two guards lunged toward Riley, Osborne snorted, a chill creeping into the air. With a surge of spatial energy, he erupted into motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the guards felt their bodies freeze, rendered immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's powerful manipulation of space trapped them in a separate dimension, blocking any path to Riley. They couldn't move, let alone awaken their only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despair flickered in their eyes as the realization settled in&mdash;their nightmare was only just beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wore a cold smile as he looked at the two guards. "You're in luck! I've decided not to kill you. Instead, you'll be joining my Blood Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flick of his mind, the two were suddenly standing before him alongside the two severely injured Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his plan, Osborne intended to transform them all into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four drops of blood floated from Osborne, quickly merging with their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect was immediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They screamed in agony as the blood coursed through them, twisting their very essence. But soon enough, their cries ceased, replaced by looks of fervent devotion. With newfound reverence, they submitted before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!" they intoned in unison, their eyes gleaming with a mix of zeal and submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand dismissively, signaling for them to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana watched the entire transformation in horror, her hands clamped tightly over her mouth, shock etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, turning to her with a grin, "What you've just witnessed stays between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is my greatest secret. If word gets out, it could jeopardize my plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, she nodded fervently. "You can count on me! Even if it costs me my life, I won't say a word! I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised her hand, as if to confirm her vow, but Osborne gently stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're my friend, and I trust you. If I didn't believe in you, I wouldn't have revealed any of this in the first place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words ignited a warmth in Diana, her heart swelling at the trust he placed in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne turned his attention back to Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was still deep in meditation, sweat pouring down his furrowed brow. Nearly twenty minutes had passed, and no one had tried to wake him. The anguish on Riley's face suggested he was trapped in a tormenting illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, what happens if we don't wake him soon?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression grew serious. "He'll lose his mind and slip into madness, losing all sense of himself!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
