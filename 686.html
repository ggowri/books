  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held the Goddess of Grain's scythe, his eyes filled with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiny Goddess of Grain's scythe was more terrifying than he had imagined, and it was still incredibly easy to cut off the Duke Titan's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is indeed a divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and couldn't help thinking, if a killer who was good at hiding appeared behind him silently and used the Goddess of Grain's scythe to sneak attack and assassinate him, would he be able to survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result made Osborne feel a chill in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current means, he couldn't dodge if attacked by someone at close range with the Goddess of Grain's scythe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong his body was, he would surely die if his head was cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the Goddess of Grain's scythe may be more powerful than I thought! The premise is that I can get close to the enemy and launch a sneak attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished thinking, his body merged into the darkness again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this selection of the Augustine family's successor, the person ranked first would be able to be the first to choose one of the two divine artifacts, the swallow shield and the Scythe of the Grain Goddess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne&nbsp;had decided that once he got first place, he would choose the swallow shield and give the Scythe of the Grain Goddess to the second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he would change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swallow shield might be very powerful. According to legend, it was the weapon of a </span><span>Glacium's</span><span> </span><span>god</span><span>. It had powerful defensive capabilities by absorbing any physical attacks or energy attacks and converting them into energy for the user.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne&nbsp;was physically strong, and the martial art aura&nbsp;was integrated with the eighth-level Devil's Light. In most cases, his defense was sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the Goddess of Grain's scythe was more useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could help him kill powerful enemies more easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden death of the Duke Titan caused chaos in the entire rare metal mining area. Everyone looked at the headless body of the Duke Titan in horror and fled in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Duke Titan&nbsp;was a powerful Class AAA warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be terrified when the enemy could kill the Class AAA&nbsp;Duke Titan in an instant, leaving them without even knowing who did it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone was running away madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a chaotic situation helped Osborne's actions.&nbsp;He quickly rushed towards the second Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stop making a scene! Find the enemy for me! Everyone, don't run away! You are all servants and warriors of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. I order you to find the enemy immediately and kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Duke Titan roared, his voice like thunder, in an attempt to control the situation, but the effect was very weak. He could only shout angrily and rush out himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see who dares to seek death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was speaking, the Duke Titan's face suddenly changed, and he sensed extreme danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, he turned around and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His huge fist smashed into a space crack, instantly causing it to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression suddenly turned into horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! I've been fooled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Duke Titan wanted to dodge immediately, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne used the fluctuations of space cracks to attract that Duke Titan's attention, he quickly launched a sneak attack from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was the Duke Werewolf who moved quickly, he might be able to dodge it, but the clumsy Duke Titan could not dodge it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp the Goddess of Grain's scythe easily cut through his skin, sliced, through his flesh, and completely severed his huge neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, despair appeared on the Duke Titan's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head also left his body, and blood spurted out wildly from the smooth crack in his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second Duke Titan also died on the Goddess of Grain's scythe. He killed two Class AAA men. However, there was not even a drop of blood on the Goddess of Grain's scythe. It still looked so ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the second Duke Titan's body fell, the other people in the mine became even more terrified and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, "Leave two alive, kill the rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clarissa also took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the Fate Staff, she joined in the killing. The two most powerful Duke Titans had been killed by Osborne. The others, whether Class AA or A, were no match to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Osborne's spatial power, they couldn't even escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they hid deep in the mine, Osborne would still lock&nbsp;them with Satan's Eye and kill them easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than ten minutes, the entire mining area became extremely quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for two Class AA Marquis Titans, who were lying on the ground with broken limbs, all the enemies were slaughtered by Osborne and Clarissa.</span></p><div class="pagination">
