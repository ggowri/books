  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart was heavy with thoughts of Austin as he prepared for his meeting at her villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the woman who had unexpectedly crashed into his life one wild, drunken night, igniting a whirlwind of emotions he never anticipated. Austin wanted him to be the father of her child, to be more than just her fleeting romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent her a quick message to meet up and arrived to find the villa empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Familiar with the entry code, he let himself in and glanced out the window toward the east.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There it was - the sprawling estate of Clarissa, once teeming with life and laughter, now deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had moved on, as had Donna and Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pang of nostalgia settled in Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, wait for me! I'll be in Dampston soon!" Osborne thought, a silent promise hanging in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back, he heard the unmistakable sound of quick footsteps - high heels clicking urgently against the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a doubt, it was Austin arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she burst into the room, Austin lunged into his arms, her lips crashing onto his without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a fervor in her embrace, an eagerness that spoke volumes about how much she missed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after what felt like an eternity did Austin pull back, a glimmer of joy alight in her eyes, her lips glistening with a fine strand of their connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned, saying, "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin huffed, mock annoyance dancing on her cute features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You definitely didn't miss me. I bet your head's been filled with thoughts of Clarissa! She's way prettier than I am. I mean, come on, you practically already have her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her playful pout stirred something in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't miss you, why would I be here?" Osborne countered, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin crossed her arms, her expression shifting to one of feigned injury. "Yeah, right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone's saying you've been dumped by Clarissa. The Radcliffe family whisked her away to Dampston, and she's set to marry that Alexander guy from the Paltrow family soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it because you can't see Clarissa that you came to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Osborne felt his mood darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brushed aside her playful indignation, knowing well enough it was all an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl could be quite the character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she truly cared that much, she wouldn't just play the role of "the woman behind the man".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's spreading these rumors?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's playful demeanor sobered at his serious tone. "I'm not sure, but I'd guess it's the Radcliffe family trying to suppress any public association between you and </span><span>Clarissa. They don't want anyone thinking you have ties to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then said, "Austin, I won't beat around the bush. I'm here to say goodbye. I'm heading to Dampston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color drained from Austin's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to Dampston? To chase after Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded. "I have an agreement with the Radcliffe family. I'll be competing fairly with Alexander for Clarissa's hand. If I win, she'll marry me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get there as soon as I can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was born into a life without family, without a true home here in Skyefall. However, I can't shake off the thought of someone I still have to look after."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin bit her lip, searching his eyes. "Is it... Is it me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. You're my only tie to Skyefall. Though Dampston isn't that far away, I have no idea what the future holds there or when I'll be back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why I wanted to see you, one last time before heading off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Austin's eyes as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, she threw her arms around his waist, her voice trembling with emotion. "Osborne! Thank you for saying all that. I really thought you didn't care about me at all! Thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hearing you say that is enough for me. You don't have to worry about me. Just go to Dampston and take care of what you need to do. I'll find a way to visit you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before you go, there's one really important thing you need to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Austin's cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, confusion etched on his face. "What important thing? I'm not in on this secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her embarrassment only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin lowered her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper. "Well, um, Osborne, I think... I might not be pregnant. My period came again recently, so... so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight, you need to try a little harder to help me get pregnant, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she buried her face against his chest, hiding her shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Not pregnant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After our wild night together, filled with passion and intensity, she hasn't conceived?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Austin wants me to put in more effort tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, feeling the warmth radiating from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined nod, Osborne replied, "Alright, I'll give it my all tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he scooped Austin up, cradling her legs in his arms as he lifted her effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked into her bashful face with a playful grin. "Why wait for tonight? Let's get started right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne carried her into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the air was filled with the sweet sound of Austin's panting gasps, echoing like a melody as they lost themselves in each other again and again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
