  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne entered Isa's mansion with a combination and saw her exercising in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in tight sportswear, which accentuated her tall, charming, and curvy body, behaving like an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just glanced at Osborne casually and then ignored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose embarrassedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Anastasia and Zoe upstairs, he walked back to the living room, sat on the sofa, and watched Isa exercise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne found her body a little stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This exercise, though typical for ordinary people, didn't make her break a sweat. Nevertheless, she wiped her face with a towel and shot a glare at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you staring at me? Am I so sexy that you can't take your eyes away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and nodded before saying, "Isa, you are the sexiest woman I've ever seen. If I have to sum up all the praise for you in one word, it will be perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a blush actually appeared on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not surprised at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending more time with Isa, he grew increasingly familiar with her. She wielded formidable strength and a biting tongue, often rolling her eyes and teasing him at every opportunity. If he ever blushed or felt shy, she would delight in pushing further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she would be bashful if he faced her teasing with composure, showing no signs of shyness, and openly complimented her, such as, "It's because you're so beautiful that I couldn't resist looking at you more", "Your charm is irresistible, so it's natural for me to get excited", and suchlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like now, Isa glared at Osborne again and muttered, "You're sweet-talking. Who did you learn these words to please girls from? You have developed bad habits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued with a grin, "That's not the case. Isa, you are really beautiful. I admire you from the bottom of my heart. All the compliments can't express one ten-thousandth of my true feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Isa's ears turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip. Suddenly, she stared at Osborne and asked, "Tell me, who is prettier, me or Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He choked instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched his nose, at a loss for words for a moment. Deep down, Clarissa was, of course, the most beautiful, while Isa was definitely as attractive as her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Clarissa was his girlfriend, so he was partial towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, when Isa posed this question, no matter how Osborne responded, it seemed inappropriate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he admitted that he thought Clarissa was prettier, Isa would surely give him the cold shoulder, followed by her deliberate attacks and scolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a Class A martial master, he had no confidence that he could defeat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, she was like a bottomless abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was impossible for him to say that Isa was prettier because he was unwilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "Why are you silent? Didn't you just praise me for being perfect? In this case, how could I not outshine Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she folded her arms across her chest and gazed at Osborne with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, he sensed the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that if his answer displeased Isa, let alone asking her for help, he would be lucky not to be beaten by her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered and quickly replied, "Isa, I can't compare you with Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you mean I'm not qualified to be compared with Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sense of danger became stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt Isa's slender thighs were taut and poised, ready to kick him away at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he remained calm and explained, "No! I mean, you two have completely different styles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my eyes, Clarissa is like an angel. She is also perfect. I can't find any flaws in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you are a goddess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your beauty doesn't belong to this world, but Clarissa is my girlfriend. I prefer not to compare her with anyone else. Even with ordinary looks, she is the most beautiful to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my friend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The same goes for you. Whether perfect or not, you are still my friend, and no one can replace you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Isa was stunned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cold face slowly softened, and she couldn't help but roll her eyes and glare at him sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted, "How dare you still claim you haven't developed any bad habits? You must have said that to a lot of girls, right? Do you intend to please me in this way? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pivoted around and wiped her face with the towel again to cover up her slightly flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that his answer didn't upset her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the subject and said, "Isa, I need your help!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
