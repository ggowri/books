  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? An Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King defeated a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the judges were dumbfounded at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were reluctant to believe Gerald's words, but they knew he wouldn't deceive them about such matters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at them, sneering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, when Gerald witnessed the outcome of the battle, he was even more shocked than these people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Do you think this is over?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eventually, one of the princes stepped in, facing the siege of three mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors! And in the end, ten minutes later, that prince defeated them all alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the judges were stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That prince, an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, defeating mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors is one thing. But he actually won against three of them at once?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This sounds just like a myth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that those three mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, out of respect for the princes and princesses, held back and intentionally let them win?" one judge questioned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "Do you think I can't tell whether those three mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors gave it their all? At that time, besides me, there were other Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, and even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors present!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that the princes and princesses relied on the power of the Sacred Artifact to win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded. "Of course! For them to defeat mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they definitely relied on the power of the Sacred Artifact! Their Sacred Artifact is indeed very powerful, but that's also part of their strength! Moreover, I can confirm that they used their own power to drive the Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're not like Brenda. Her Ice Scepter is so powerful because a warrior from Skyearth Dominion infused it with power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When she uses it, she doesn't need to rely on her own strength to drive it! But the princes and princesses rely on their own power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, they are much stronger than Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they truly fought, she would probably be defeated by the princes and princesses within a few moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Gerald finished speaking, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were truly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they were quite experienced, but they never knew that the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom were this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't understand how the princes and princesses managed to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald continued, "I heard that these princes and princesses could have broken through Empyrean Sacredness long ago! They are deliberately suppressing their cultivation level, refusing to break through..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh? Why would they do that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, I didn't know why either, but now I think I understand! They are deliberately suppressing their cultivation level to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel won't be that simple! There must be a reason why they're suppressing their cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, the two princes and one princess I just mentioned will definitely participate in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! They are Prince Emiliano, Prince Matthew, and Princess Rosalie."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Royal Family, the three of them are considered to have relatively average talent! There are many princes and princesses stronger than them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will be thrilling!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Gerald noticed they were nearing the Cosmic Translocator and immediately waved his hand. "Alright! Let's not talk about this anymore! Remember to keep what I told you confidential, and don't spread it around."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We know what to do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone snapped out of their shock and nodded firmly. Their eyes revealed anticipation. They wished the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel could start right away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could hardly wait to witness the performances of those princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to see if the princes and princesses were really as powerful as Gerald said!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, after the Zone Duel ends, it will take another six months before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel officially begins.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they still have to wait another six months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they finally returned to the Cosmic Translocator, and Brenda and her teammates were already back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Brenda, surrounded at the center with a confident and proud expression, the judges couldn't help but shake their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, they all thought she was very impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They even thought she was the strongest below Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now their thoughts have changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda is far behind compared to the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom at the same cultivation level as her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How did those princes and princesses become so strong?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When they break through to Empyrean Sacredness, I&rsquo;m afraid even we advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors won&rsquo;t be their match, right?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They suddenly felt a bit disinterested. Some of them had initially planned to befriend these zone duel contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, they are prodigies with limitless futures. Building a good relationship with them in advance would benefit these judges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, these judges just found a spot in the distance to sit quietly and wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, several warriors were repairing the Cosmic Translocator. At this pace, it would be fixed in a day at the earliest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, they could return to the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone beside Brenda pointed in a direction and said, "Brenda, someone is coming over there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, most of the contestants had been united by her to act together. She was well aware of their gains and knew they posed no threat to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there were still some contestants acting alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for them, Brenda wasn&rsquo;t sure about their gains. Although she felt their gains couldn&rsquo;t surpass hers, she still needed to be cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she noticed a man and two women slowly approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were Osborne, Leroy, and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's that guy named Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone asked with a slightly displeased expression, "Is he still alive? I didn&rsquo;t see him in the team. I thought he was dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda raised an eyebrow and asked, "Osborne? The one who bet nearly three million Sacred Crystals on himself to win at the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, that's him! He's too arrogant. He actually looks down on all of us! I was thinking of teaching him a hard lesson here to show him he's not that special. However, I never got the chance to run into him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I guess he was deliberately avoiding us before, afraid we'd target him, so he just stayed in some remote corner with no resources."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that the zone duel is over, he finally dares to show up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone showed disdainful expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda frowned and murmured, "Three million Sacred Crystals is no small amount! Either he has so many Sacred Crystals he can't spend them all, or he's crazy, or he's extremely confident in himself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly felt uneasy and softly suggested, "Who&rsquo;s willing to go test him out? I want to know what his strength really is! It&rsquo;d be best to figure out how many resources and treasures he&rsquo;s gained!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
