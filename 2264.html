  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's overwhelming Sacred Power bore down on her, Clara made a jaw-dropping call&mdash;she threw in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden surrender left the onlookers dead silent in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense showdown had played out inside Osborne's body, so nobody had a clue what had really gone down. All they'd witnessed was Clara snaring him with her quasi-Sacred Artifact chain, and then, out of the blue, letting the chain go limp for no apparent reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzlement was etched all over the audience's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the heck just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did Clara tap out? Wasn't the match in the bag for her? No one's ever wriggled free from her quasi-Sacred Artifact chain before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did she just let him go on purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be a setup! A total under-the-table deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must have whispered to her, promising some juicy benefits, which is why she threw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just low! Osborne can't beat Clara, so he resorts to these underhanded tactics and tries to buy her off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew Osborne was up to something! He put down ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself! Who else can just whip that kind of cash out of thin air? He's definitely not just some run-of-the-mill guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can buy Clara with Sacred Crystals, I wouldn't put it past him to try and bribe Tyson, Pero, or even Marreese. Who knows? He might even sway Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just hand the championship to him already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd buzzed with indignation, many were convinced that Clara had thrown the match after receiving some incentive from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outrage didn't faze him at all; after all, opinions were like elbows&mdash;everyone had one, and they'd say whatever they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clara, seething with frustration, knitted her brows and retorted, "Osborne didn't pay me off! He thrashed me fair and square! You guys just don't get it. This </span><span>isn</span><span>'</span><span>t</span><span> just an insult to him; it's an insult to me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clara strode off the arena, her face icy but calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite losing, it hardly seemed to faze her. It was like winning the championship had never been on her radar, and she was remarkably level-headed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, her defense went in one ear and out the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clara's a real pro at this! She took Osborne's hush money and is now trying to cover for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they really think we're that dumb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne beat her fair and square? Yeah, pull the other one! We're not blind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the crowd's whispers and mutterings, Clara's surrender had effectively handed Osborne the victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't be bothered to offer any explanations as he made his way back to the sidelines, biding his time for the next match to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara had shown some seriously jaw-dropping strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had felt the heat she was bringing. If it hadn't been for his slight edge in Sacred Power and his knack for effortlessly restoring his energy, he might not have been able to wriggle out of her chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even if Osborne couldn't get out of the tight spot, his defenses would spell doom for Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Up next, we've got Leroy from Azure Haven Academy going head-to-head with..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battles kept coming, one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's opponent quickly threw in the towel, not wanting to waste any time or energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was another high-stakes showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was back in the ring, gearing up to take on Pero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much heed to this match, knowing full well that Pero didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As anticipated, once the competition whittled down to the top sixteen, Clara stopped holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her quasi-Sacred Artifact chain came alive, looking like a menacing serpent about to strike. The battle had barely started when the chain lashed out, ensnaring Pero just like it would've trapped Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero struggled like crazy, but he couldn't wriggle free from Clara's iron-grip chains. Frustrated and out of options, he had no choice but to throw in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his second loss&mdash;first to Tyson, and now to Clara&mdash;so his chances of landing a top-five finish were looking pretty slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of dwelling on Pero's plight, the audience's chatter quickly shifted back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe how easily Clara took down Pero? Her earlier loss to Osborne has got to be a dodgy deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way Osborne didn't bribe Clara! Otherwise, he would've been trounced! At least Pero gave it his all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! What a huge scandal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless Osborne! The Mystic Sirius Sect should be ashamed! Get out of the city duel; you don't belong here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's angry outbursts made the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect hang their heads in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Danilo, sitting high up, frowned with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne wouldn't have actually bribed Clara to throw the match, would he?" he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shot him a frosty look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danilo, don't you trust your own disciple? Are you really falling for these groundless rumors? No matter how things happened, Osborne is the champion of our Mystic Sirius Sect! He showed his mettle during the Sect Tournament!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that hard to believe he could beat Clara, the runner-up from Fantasia Isle? Do you have that little faith in the Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo was taken aback by Angela's fiery retort and stammered for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Ms. Olsen, calm down! I was just thinking out loud! Of course I have faith in Osborne! And anyway, the battles aren't over yet. He'll get to face other tough opponents and prove himself all over again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression softened a bit. "He definitely will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the matches rolled on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan each took part in a couple of duels. They managed to snag one win and suffered one loss, and those losses came against opponents who were truly in a league of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it was Osborne's turn again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his opponent was none other than Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the referee announced the match, Tyson's eyes blazed with intense determination, a cold resolve burning deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He zipped onto the stage in a flash, brandishing his huge fire-tipped spear and zeroing in on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, prepare to bite the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went wild with excitement, their cheers reaching a deafening crescendo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyson! Teach Osborne a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him buy you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smash him! Give him a good thrashing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encouraged by their rallying cries, Tyson grinned wider, relishing the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you stand a chance here? You might've bought off Clara, but you won't buy me! I won't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile faintly at Tyson's bravado. "</span><span>So</span><span> you believe I bribed Clara? That's the only way I could have bested her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson looked unimpressed. "Isn't that obvious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really?" Osborne shrugged, a glimmer of mischief in his eyes. "Well, if that's what you believe, let's just go with it! But you say you won't be swayed by cash? I find that hard to believe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sly grin, Osborne added, "How about this&mdash;I'll give you ten thousand Sacred Crystals if you just hand over the victory to me right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena fell into stunned silence, everyone wide-eyed, staring at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Tyson momentarily lost his composure, flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait... does he really think he can buy me off?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></p><div class="pagination">
