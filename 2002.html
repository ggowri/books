  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne Augustine?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was puzzled, trying hard to recall, but she had never heard of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, having another Supernal Deity King among the Human Community is good news, especially with the war about to break out. He..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has another name&mdash;Theodore Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro interrupted God of Light for the first time, quickly speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore Augustine?! The Theodore Augustine from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right, the Theodore from the Seven Young Deity Kings! But Theodore is just an alias. His real name is Osborne Augustine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also... he is my grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro said with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew of Theodore and the Seven Young Deity Kings. When they caused a stir in the East Zone, she went so far as to secretly send the Radiant Guardians to safeguard them and bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once praised the Seven Young Deity Kings' talent, calling them the hope of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had not heard anything about them, or Theodore, in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was hearing about them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore... no, Osborne is your grandson? Is he already broken through to become a Supernal Deity King? That is fast! Just a few months ago, when I first heard his name, he was only at mid Deity King Level, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro beamed. "That is right! He is already a Supernal Deity King! And even among Supernal Deity Kings, he still has the strength to challenge higher levels! And... not just one level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, all the other members of the Seven Young Deity Kings have broken through to become Supernal Deity Kings! They all can challenge higher levels!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's words left God of Light in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Many prodigies in the Human Community can challenge higher levels, but that is below Deity King Level. Once you reach Deity King Level, few can challenge above their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And after becoming a Supernal Deity King, it is difficult to challenge beyond one's level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few people in the entire Human Community can do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro said that all the Seven Young Deity Kings reached the Supernal Deity King Level and can challenge higher levels. Can they even challenge two levels higher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was not unfamiliar with such prodigies. She thought, "The former Seven Great Deity Kings, including myself, could challenge above their level when we were at Ascension One or Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who were we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There have only been seven people like us in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have the same combat strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light suddenly grew excited and spoke. "So, what you are saying is, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have formed a new force? They call it 'Demon Slayer'? Demon Slayer... what a name they are out to defeat Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they now? I want to meet them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If their strength is as powerful as you say, then at least we will win one match in tomorrow's border competition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a match between Supernal Deity Kings, if they participate, no one will be their match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro smiled, "God of Light, they are already waiting outside! They came here for tomorrow's border competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what are we waiting for? Bring them in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Jethro led Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others into the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked around at the Sanctum of Light's interior and could not help but feel a sense of familiarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does this place feel so familiar...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is like I have been here before... " Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, it is just your imagination! How could you have been here before? It is the Sanctum of Light, the residence of the God of Light! Maybe it feels familiar because you have seen similar designs somewhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled, but Osborne could sense she was a bit nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the person they were about to meet was the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the strongest warriors in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pillar and protector of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never met such a big shot before, even though they were now Supernal Deity Kings, and they could not help but feel a little nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you are right! But do not worry too much. God of Light is just a Supernal Deity King, and we are also Supernal Deity Kings. We are all in the same now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is only a few levels higher than you guys. With your talents, it will not be hard to reach her level or even surpass her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, just relax!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa said God of Light is easy to get along with. She is not aloof!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words did not help the others relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia rolled her eyes at him and said, "No matter what, God of Light is an iconic personality! It is natural to feel nervous about meeting such a prominent figure, okay?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unlike you, who is not nervous at all! You would better be careful and show her respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged but did not argue and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are almost there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Jethro led them to the massive doors of the sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous doors bore intricate carvings of strange patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The patterns seemed to tell a story&mdash;of a dark figure teaching a young boy and five girls the art of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at these patterns, Osborne felt that same sense of familiarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he tried, he could not remember where he had seen these patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be because I have sealed too many memories, causing some confusion? I have never seen these patterns before, so why do they feel familiar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do the dark figure, the boy, and the five girls represent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and decided not to think about it further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the massive doors in front of them rumbled open. Osborne quickly looked inside. He thought, "According to Grandpa, God of Light awaits us inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have only heard of her before, a legendary figure who stood at the peak of the Human Community a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the two survivors of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How strong is she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of person is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was curious, and as the doors opened, he finally saw the scene inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw the God of Light!</span></p><div class="pagination">
