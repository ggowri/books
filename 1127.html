  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, so using the Breath of Celestial to forge a Divine Body could potentially create something beyond a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body, or even a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body? An Omnipotent Divine Body?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Is the Breath of Celestial really that extraordinary? Isn't it just </span><span>a secret technique to boost my power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, he knew Isa wouldn't lead him astray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, are you absolutely sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head slowly. "I've told you before, no one has ever trained with the Breath of Celestial. You're the first one! I can't predict what will happen&mdash;You might create an Omnipotent Divine Body, or you might end up with something even less than a basic Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, the path you're on is entirely new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How far you can go depends solely on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, weighing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I could create an Omnipotent Divine Body, but I could also end up with a useless body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a pretty huge risk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the idea of an Omnipotent Divine Body is just a legend. The chances of pulling that off seem slim to none. If I end up with a worthless body, wouldn't it be safer to stick with the methods Isa provided and just forge a Level Seven Solar Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a Level Seven Solar Divine Body is already incredibly powerful&mdash;most Deity Kings are just Level Seven Solar Divine Bodies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I should play it safe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With hesitation, he asked, "Isa, why push me down this unique path? With your skills, you could easily guide me along a more reliable route, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa fell silent, her expression contemplative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally spoke, her voice low and serious, "Because we need hope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hope?" Osborne echoed, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded vigorously. "Yes, because the more reliable paths have already been exhausted by the seven Deity Kings. They reached their limits! Even when they banded together, they could barely defeat Lord Malevolence and seal him away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They couldn't even kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And one day, Lord Malevolence will break free from that seal. When that happens, he'll be stronger than ever before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the seven Deity Kings were to regroup or even form an alliance of eight or nine, they wouldn't stand a chance against Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To defeat him, we need to find a new path of cultivation. We need someone stronger than a Deity King to emerge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's where hope comes in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every new path of cultivation represents a chance for hope! It might lead you to a dead end, but it could also be the way to surpass the Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now, you're walking that very path!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are our hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, stunned. It finally clicked for him why Isa had been so insistent on pushing him to grow stronger, to evolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw him as the beacon of hope against Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven Deity Kings had pushed the conventional paths to their limits and still couldn't handle Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So a new route was necessary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could anyone expect to carve out a new path? The odds were that it would lead to failure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow tightly. "Isa, do you really think I can pull this off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't believe you can do it! But there's still a glimmer of hope, isn't there? When it comes to facing Lord Malevolence, we can't afford to overlook even the tiniest bit of hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least you've reached Class S! We've explored countless new paths of cultivation, and 99% of those who tried couldn't even make it to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your achievement proves that this path you're on has the potential to lead somewhere. What you need to do now is to keep pushing forward and keep striving until you reach the end of this journey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that end is beyond the realm of Deity Kings, then we might just have a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if this path doesn't lead to anything greater than a Deity King, then we're all doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I can do is buy you more time!" Isa said, taking Osborne's hand with a firm and reassuring grip. "Osborne, this path wasn't chosen for you; you chose it yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? I chose this?" Osborne blinked, confusion washing over him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Wasn't it Isa who taught me the Breath of Celestial and guided the merging of my soul powers and body? How is this my choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held back his thoughts and nodded resolutely. "Isa, I'll give it my all. I won't let you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face broke into a bright smile. "That's the spirit! You're my man, after all, and you're the best! If you can't do it, then no one else stands a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wrapped her arms around Osborne's neck and pulled him in for a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stayed locked in that moment for what felt like an eternity before she finally released him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, could you head outside and wait for me? I have a few things to discuss with the Fatebearer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? But Clarissa hasn't woken up yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa simply smiled at him, her expression serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his nose, feeling a mix of concern and resignation, and eventually stepped outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was gone, Isa turned her attention back to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess of Fate, are you still pretending to be asleep?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
