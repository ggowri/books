  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sneak attack me? I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had Satan&rsquo;s Eye&rsquo;s crisis warning and wasn&rsquo;t afraid of sneak attacks at all. He suddenly kicked back heavily on his enemy&rsquo;s fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, Osborne felt a tremendous force coming from the soles of his feet. He couldn&rsquo;t help but rise into the air, landing and taking a few steps back before getting his body under control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t help but become more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a strong power.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked and thought, &ldquo;I used my feet, and he used his fist. But in a contest of strength, I actually lost? This enemy&rsquo;s power is incomparably terrifying. Even the three werewolves combined are inferior to him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That man had a bearded face and an expressionless countenance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at his face with a look of contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, you look great in this look. You are much more handsome than you really are.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Osborne finished, the other man remained expressionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t want to change his expression, but because he was wearing a human skin mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it had been anyone else, they might not have recognized him as Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But unfortunately, Osborne had Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could see through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Through the human skin mask, Osborne saw Paul&rsquo;s expression become instantly grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. You&rsquo;ve ruined things for the organization a few times. Now I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, Paul struck again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not only was his strength terrifying, but his speed was equally impressive. He reached Osborne in an instant and quickly sliced towards Osborne&rsquo;s throat with his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne reacted exceptionally quickly and instantly raised his alloy dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s hand contacted Osborne&rsquo;s alloy dagger. Osborne stepped back again while Paul grunted. The boxing gloves he wore on his hand had been sliced through an opening, and blood flowed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a sharp dagger.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strike together and kill him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At his command, the few remaining werewolves came together at once. They cooperated with Paul to surround Osborne, hitting him with deadly moves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it were two days ago, facing Paul with so many werewolves surrounding him, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t have been sure of surviving even with Clarissa&rsquo;s healing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t the least bit flustered and grunted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You will die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A fierce battle broke out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the leader of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard team, Paul was an extremely powerful Class C martial artist. Combined with a group of Class E or even Class D werewolves, even a Class C+ powerhouse might not be his match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne, relying on Satan&rsquo;s Eye with his Class B daggers, blocked their attacks completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He took the life of a werewolf with every counterattack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, five more werewolves fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that he still couldn&rsquo;t kill Osborne, Paul turned completely serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly broke away from the battlefield, no longer caring about Osborne but making a quick dash for Clarissa&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul pulled on the car door. And when it didn&rsquo;t pull open, he slammed his fist down hard on the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bulletproof glass that could withstand sniper bullets was smashed with countless cracks by Paul&rsquo;s terrifying fist, and the entire car shook violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul blasted the car window with punch after punch. The glass shattered across the ground and was about to be smashed through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa in the car turned pale at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, help me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression changed. His ocular energy erupted violently, controlling the bodies of the last three werewolves. He stabbed his alloy dagger through their hearts instantly, ending their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned his head and just saw Paul smash his fist through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare,&rdquo; Osborne shouted sternly, unable to care too much, and violently threw the alloy dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was about to reach for Clarissa in the car. He had to stop his movement and duck quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The alloy dagger thrillingly flew past his ear, nearly cutting it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are courting death. You&rsquo;ve completely angered me,&rdquo; Paul shouted angrily as his body abruptly began to change, becoming taller and thinner. The nails of his fingers became longer, like blood-red daggers. Two long fangs appeared in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, he was like a legendary vampire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, watch out. He&rsquo;s one of the Blood Clan.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa exclaimed at the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul moved lightning-fast and was at Osborne&rsquo;s side in an instant. Even though Osborne had Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he could barely make out Paul&rsquo;s movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s left eye trembled wildly, sensing a powerful threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without thinking, he jerked aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it was still late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul caught Osborne in the chest, his sharp nails nearly ripping Osborne&rsquo;s body apart. Thanks to the Class B Defensive Soft Armor, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t disemboweled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But even so, Osborne still felt a terrifying force hit him, knocking his body fiercely out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne!&rdquo; Clarissa exclaimed at once, but there was nothing she could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul sneered and reappeared at Osborne&rsquo;s side, clasping Osborne&rsquo;s shoulders with his sharp claws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;In front of the current me, you are simply as weak as an ant. You are simply feeble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, you can go die.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
