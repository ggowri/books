  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's starting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Ascension Four match! Our Human Community is actually sending eight Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings to participate! It's simply unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two days ago, the Human Community sent out ten Ascension Four warriors, including Leopold, who was hailed as the strongest Ascension Four in the Human Community, and they still lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, sending the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings to fight in the Ascension Four match... isn't this too reckless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have already won the Ascension One, Ascension Two, and Ascension Three matches for us! They are already heroes of the Human Community. They don't need to take such risks. Even if we lose the Ascension Four match, we're already satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope nothing happens to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they get a feel for the strength of Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, they should concede immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has spatial power, so he should be safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people were watching the arena, discussing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone believed that the Human Community had no intention of winning this Ascension Four match. They were simply letting the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings experience the power of Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the strength Anastasia and Zoe had displayed was, at most, equivalent to that of an ordinary Ascension Three Supernal Deity King. Compared to Ascension Four, the gap was enormous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne had the strength of an Ascension Four, he couldn't single-handedly defeat ten Ascension Four warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, everyone thought that shortly after the battle began, Osborne would concede and use his spatial power to take the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings off the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they didn't die, their courage to face Ascension Four opponents would be enough to inspire the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what happened after the battle began surprised everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately activated the Absolute Forbidden Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive phantom of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity appeared behind him, then exploded, enveloping the arena in a blood-red energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone within the arena's range had their cultivation levels forcibly suppressed to Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden change caused the ten Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, who had been preparing to deliver a fatal blow, to change their expressions. They panicked as they felt their cultivation levels being suppressed. They struggled desperately, but the most they could do was restore their levels to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ascension Two was their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings were no match for Osborne and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's command, Anastasia and the others immediately attacked. Previously, the seven of them had been able to take on a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings. Now, their opponents were only ten Ascension Two warriors...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a fight with no suspense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others moved so quickly that most people hadn't even reacted before their opponents' Divine Bodies exploded, leaving no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened too fast. The spectators hadn't even had time to react. While they were still wondering when Osborne would concede, were the ten Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings already dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Human Alliance thought they might be seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings were, they couldn't possibly be a match for them, let alone kill them instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the facts were right before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person might have gotten dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with billions of people, it's unlikely that all of them would have gotten dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those ten Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings had truly been killed by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of intense chatter erupted. The Human Alliance was so shocked that they forgot to cheer, instead discussing what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had those ten Paramount Supreme Clan Ascension Four warriors just stood there and let themselves be killed by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength they had displayed was, at most, equivalent to Ascension Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who knew the effects of the Absolute Forbidden Zone understood what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such as the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light looked at the Human Community leaders around her, all of whom were in shock, and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Absolute Forbidden Zone is truly a terrifying ability!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder even the God of Night wants the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! If the God of Night had obtained it, even Lord Malevolence wouldn't have been a threat, would he? It's a pity... Osborne's talent is incredible, not inferior to the God of Night, perhaps even stronger. But his cultivation level is still too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He can't fully unleash the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan won't give us much time. They won't give him the chance to grow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, the God of Light sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt a violent surge of energy and let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, you're seeking death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With me here, you can't harm them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Light pointed a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive barrier of light appeared in the arena, shielding Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a black blade struck the light barrier, creating a deafening noise and unleashing terrifying energy. But it couldn't penetrate the barrier and was forced to retreat back into the Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Icy One's voice rang out. His massive divine power projection appeared, glaring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also stared at Icy One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, Icy One had suddenly launched a sneak attack on them. The speed was so fast that even Osborne hadn't reacted in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the God of Light had intervened in time, blocking Icy One's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, you truly have no shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Paramount Supreme Clan's trash couldn't defeat me in the arena, so you threw a tantrum and tried to sneak attack me? The leader of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, resorting to sneak attacks? Aren't you afraid of becoming a laughingstock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke with disdain, but Icy One didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was filled with killing intent as he said, "What was that technique you used just now? It suppressed their cultivation levels! Because of my carelessness, the Paramount Supreme Clan has lost ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I have no idea what you're talking about! It's just that your Paramount Supreme Clan's Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings are too weak. They were no match for us at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever, this is so boring! I didn't even get to enjoy the fight, and today's matches are already over! Your Paramount Supreme Clan has zero wins and eight losses. How laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to our agreement, you need to take your Dark Deity Legion and retreat five million miles! Better get moving, or you might not make it in time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For tomorrow's matches, make sure to send some stronger opponents. But I wouldn't be surprised if you're too scared to show up after such a crushing defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne looked at Icy One with utter disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One clenched his fists tightly, his expression turning extremely ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Fine, fine! Today, the Paramount Supreme Clan has lost! I never expected the Human Community to produce someone like you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll challenge again in tomorrow's matches!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
