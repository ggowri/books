  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression grew more serious as he gazed at the group of young elites in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were hundreds of them, and he could sense that the vast majority were at Class AAA, with only a few at his own Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he had mentally prepared himself for this, seeing such a large gathering of powerful figures up close was still a shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of anxiety started to wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that in just over twenty days, these same people would be in Newport City for his ceremony. Many of them would likely challenge him, and his task was clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to defeat every single one of them, fighting until no one dared to step forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was the only way he could pass The Seventh Inheritance Trial and secure his place as the rightful heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is going to be impossible..." Osborne muttered, his voice barely audible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you say?" Stuart caught his words, turning to him with a sly grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't tell me you're getting cold feet, Axell. All these young prodigies from around the world got you nervous already? And just so you know, this isn't even the full crowd yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The real big shots haven't even arrived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When the Honor Quest Ceremony kicks off in a couple of days, all the top-tier talents from around the globe will be here. They're saying there'll be over a thousand fighters at Class AAA!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His excitement was palpable, his face flushed with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A thousand! If they all went all out, they could probably level a country, maybe even send the world back to the Stone Age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before, I could only listen to Rhett's stories about these events. I wasn't at Class AAA then, so I didn't get to join. But now, I'm finally in the game, and I'm going to make sure everyone remembers my name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm getting on the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to make that list!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's excitement was barely contained, but he wisely kept his voice low to avoid drawing too much attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, however, couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the unfamiliar term. "Godson Rankings? What's that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart suddenly froze, staring at Osborne in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that moment, Osborne's heart sank as he realized he had just made a critical mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, seriously? You've been out in the world training for over a decade, and you don't even know about the Godson Rankings? I've been holed up in the family all this time, and even I know about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart looked at Osborne, suspicion written all over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Luckily, Emma jumped in quickly, "Come on, it's not that strange. Axell's been all about his training, so he's never really bothered with this kind of stuff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, the Godson Rankings are also determined by the Diviner League. Only those who've reached Class S can make it onto Quasi-Divine Rankings. Those who haven't hit Class S yet can only compete for a spot on Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are five hundred spots on the Godson Rankings. Anyone who hasn't hit S-level can make it, no matter their age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The ones who do make it are the top Class AAA fighters. The rumor is that the top ten on the list are nearly as strong as Class S.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In our generation, about a hundred have made it onto the Godson Rankings. These are the absolute best, young, talented, and powerful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly nodded as if it all made sense now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was too focused on training before, so I didn't really pay attention to any of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart let out a laugh, "Yeah, with your mediocre talent, if you'd tried to focus on anything else, you probably wouldn't even be at Class AA! Unlike me, I'm definitely destined to make it onto the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was practically glowing with pride, but Osborne just rolled his eyes, not in the mood to engage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Rhett? He must be on the Godson Rankings, right? Where does he stand?" Osborne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's expression turned a bit awkward. "Three years ago, Rhett took his first shot at the Godson Rankings, but he didn't make it. But this time, he's got a lot more confidence. He's determined to secure his spot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was a bit taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd sensed just how strong Rhett was, so it was surprising that he hadn't made the cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That meant Rhett wasn't even in the top hundreds of their generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With my current skills, do I even stand a chance at making the Godson Rankings? Who knows? I'll have to fight to find out. But in just over twenty days, all these young elites from the Godson Rankings might be gunning for me...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I can't even break into that list, I might as well give up now," Osborne thought, feeling the pressure mounting again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, they had finally reached the front of the Williamson family's castle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three arenas were set up there, with intense battles raging in two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the third arena, a guy in his mid-thirties had just stepped up, his eyes cold as he scanned the crowd below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Any contenders from the Godson Rankings want to test me? I'm aiming for a spot on that list."</p><div class="pagination">
