  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne already had confidence in completing the third heir test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday's probe showed Osborne Barlyn's weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was addicted to alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially fine wines, Barlyn had no resistance. Because of his duty as the bodyguard captain, Barlyn missed two opportunities to taste fine wines yesterday. He's probably deeply regretting it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to continue. He wanted to make Barlyn completely unable to bear it, forcing him to resign as the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Barlyn resigned, Osborne would be confident in becoming the new bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were three days left, Osborne didn't plan to wait that long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he would officially become the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Anastasia was still bedridden. Even with enough longevity herbs, she could only live for a year at most. He had to complete the six heir tests within a year and elevate his status enough to get her into the Godfather's medical research lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was pressing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne arrived at the Radcliffe Manor. Today, the fourth bodyguard unit, led by Violet, was in charge of protecting Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Violet, where's Captain Barlyn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet smiled bitterly. "He probably hasn't gotten up yet. Yesterday, an expert infiltrated the Radcliffe Manor. Even the early warning system failed. Captain Barlyn led the team and searched the manor three times but found no one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, he was still uneasy and personally guarded Ms. Radcliffe until almost dawn before he slept."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit guilty hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert who infiltrated the Radcliffe Manor was </span><span>Isa</span><span>. Osborne had arranged for her to do it. He didn't expect it would scare Barlyn so much that he wouldn't sleep all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was good too. The more exhausted Barlyn was, the more likely he would resign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go see him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived at the center of the manor. It was in front of a luxurious three-story villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This three-story villa was the main building of the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Donna, and Barlyn lived here. It was along with some female bodyguards, for the convenience of protecting Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the deputy captain, Osborne easily entered the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't go to the second and third floors of the villa, so he had to wait on the first floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Clarissa and Donna were having breakfast in the first-floor dining room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne, Clarissa's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... Mr. Augustine, have you had breakfast? Why not join us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Ms. Radcliffe, I've already eaten. I'm here to see Captain Barlyn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked a bit disappointed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't show it. She nodded and said, "Barlyn is in his room. You can go find him, but he didn't rest well last night and is still sleeping."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and said, "I'm not in a hurry. I'll wait here for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne found a corner to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From here, he couldn't see the dining room, so it wouldn't make anyone uncomfortable. However, he could hear the conversation inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, is Skyefall Security not selling to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna replied, "Sir Ashford personally contacted the Draco Group's executives and offered a billion dollars, but they still refused. Skyefall Security will be sold, but it already has a buyer. It won't be sold to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity. If we could buy Skyefall Security, your safety would be more assured. They have a Class A early warning defense system. If we bought it, we could install it here. Even the Aberrants wouldn't be able to easily assassinate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned and said, "If they won't sell, can we negotiate a partnership with Skyefall Security? Can they lease the early warning defense system to us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spending more money shouldn't be an issue, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head. "Sir Ashford asked, but they said the new owner hasn't taken over yet. They can't decide. We must wait a few days to negotiate with the new owner personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we might not be able to reach an agreement. That Class A early warning system is the only one in Skyefall. It has immense power, and many factions are eyeing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although the annual rent is five billion, it's absolutely worth it. It's far superior to the Class B early warning system we're currently using."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa sighed, too. "No matter what, we have to try! When the new owner of Skyefall Security arrives, I'll personally talk to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't know who the new owner will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, in the corner, couldn't help but be extremely surprised by their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyefall Security Services is being sold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's already a new owner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the annual rent for the Class A early warning defense system is five billion? How powerful is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hired over a hundred professional bodyguards for just two billion a year. Five billion could form a massive bodyguard team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Donna thought it's worth it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class A early warning defense system? My current status allows me to buy some Class B individual equipment. When I complete the third heir test and my status is raised to three stars, can I buy the Class A early warning defense system?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it be profitable to buy it and rent it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more eager to complete the test.</span></p><div class="pagination">
