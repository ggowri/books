  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enemy attack incoming. Take cover," Apollo shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that even behind cover, they would be targeted by a sniper. The enemy had managed to flank them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly directed his men to dodge and defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two elemental metahumans swiftly activated their extra powers, trying to protect everyone as they had done before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this required time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before that could happen, Osborne fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man nearby quickly dodged behind a large tree, but before he could fully hide, his chest erupted in a spray of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-caliber sniper bullet pierced through his chest, creating a gaping hole. Where there should have been red blood, there was only a metallic sheen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a mechanical cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with his body reinforced by cutting-edge high-strength alloy, he couldn't withstand the power of a Class B sniper gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at the hole in his chest, his mouth twitching. The life quickly faded from his eyes, and he collapsed, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another of Apollo's men fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an earth wall finally blocked Osborne's line of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fired twice more, hitting the wall and creating two large craters. Though the bullets pierced the wall, they lost their momentum and no longer posed a threat to Apollo and his men behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't discouraged and continued to wait for his opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Counterattack. Counterattack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo roared in fury. Losing two more elite men had enraged him completely. He hadn't even faced the enemy directly, yet he had already lost nine men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he hadn't even seen what his opponent looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't stand this. He had to take out the hiding sniper no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sniper position was not far from Apollo, less than a mile away. Apollo's elite snipers had quickly locked onto Osborne's approximate location when he fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they retaliated swiftly towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A barrage of sniper bullets rained down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, even smirking coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ocular energy flickered, instantly capturing the speeding sniper bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bullets lost their power before they could reach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To retaliate against Osborne, these snipers had to leave the protection of the earth wall. Even a small part of their body exposed was enough for Osborne to target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't hesitate to pull the bolt and shoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One sniper was hit in the eye by Osborne, his entire head disappearing. Another shot rang out, and the second sniper's helmet exploded, his skull flying off. The third sniper's scope was hit, but luckily, he ducked quickly and escaped death. But the next second, another sniper bullet came, piercing through his head, neck, chest, and abdomen, exiting through his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, get back. Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's eyes were bloodshot as he shouted, ordering the remaining three snipers to retreat behind the earth wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining three snipers, seeing the horrific state of their comrades, showed expressions of terror. Despite countless battles, they couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deaths of their comrades were too gruesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through their night vision goggles, they could clearly see Osborne nearby. With their marksmanship, each shot should easily hit Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their bullets seemed to hit an invisible barrier, unable to strike Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's shots continued to take out their comrades one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unscathed while they lost three more snipers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those three snipers was a Class C plus martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even ancient families found it extremely difficult and costly to cultivate a Class C plus expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each loss of such a powerful individual was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's eyes turned blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face no longer showed confidence, only madness. He was completely overwhelmed by Osborne's sniping, unlike anything he had experienced abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even confronted Osborne directly, yet he had lost twelve elite men, all members of the Viper Squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the weakest were Class C martial artists, and even a Class C plus expert had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo roared to the sky, his murderous intent nearly overwhelming his sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! I'm going to take them all out. Tear them apart one by one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security's snipers were terrifying. Apollo knew that if they didn't fight back, his men would be picked off one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only option was to use extra energy for defense, close the distance with the enemy, and engage in direct combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In close combat, the sniper gun loses its effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's remaining men immediately moved, quickly advancing towards Osborne under the protection of the earth wall and water spheres.</span></p><div class="pagination">
