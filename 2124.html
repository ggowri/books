  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Azure Ore had a unique ability: it could be infused into divine artifacts, amplifying their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was eager to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck had provided him with the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging, which contained the precise methods for integrating Azure Ore into divine artifacts. Osborne decided to enhance his Bloodwrought Bow and see what kind of results he could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the bow could become even more powerful, it would be a game changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow was a gift from the Creation Herald, an Apex divine artifact that was significantly stronger than the average Ultimate divine artifact. It fit perfectly with Osborne's fighting style, complementing his various attack techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew it wasn't the pinnacle of divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, the Bloodwrought Bow was formidable, but in the grand scheme of the cosmos, it was merely average among Apex divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still plenty of room for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Chuck had mentioned that with enough Azure Ore, a divine artifact could even undergo a transformation, becoming a Sacred Artifact imbued with Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power possessed by a Sacred Artifact was light years beyond what Osborne currently wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never seen a Sacred Artifact, but he understood its terrifying potential. Even the most ordinary Deity King could likely vanquish top-tier Supernal Deity Kings if they wielded a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Artifact..." Osborne mused, gazing intently at the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of transforming it into a Sacred Artifact sparked a fire within him. If he could pull it off, the war in Celestara would be a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they dared to refuse surrender, he'd rain arrows upon them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll keep watch and alert you to any dangers. Just focus on using the Azure Ore to enhance your divine artifact!" Alfreda offered, her voice steady and reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded appreciatively. "Thanks, I really appreciate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and flipped through the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging, meticulously studying the section on infusing Azure Ore into divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Osborne felt confident he had grasped the method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow floated before him, and in his hand, he held a piece of Azure Ore that glimmered with a blue light. A surge of Sacred Power flowed from Osborne's body, enveloping the Azure Ore as intricate patterns began to form on its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Azure Ore displayed a remarkable array of unique designs, and as it did, the once-solid ore began to melt, morphing into a blue, gelatinous form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, excitement bubbling within him, "The energy of the Azure Ore is being released!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Good thing I have Sacred Power! It'll take just a few minutes to break down the Azure Ore's energy. If I were relying solely on my divine power, it would take days!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I can't afford to waste that kind of time!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>All I need to do now is inject this energy into the Bloodwrought Bow! The Azure Ore's energy will automatically enhance the bow at its core, making it sturdier and more powerful. If I push it to its limits, it could even undergo a transformation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination, Osborne directed the Sacred Power, infusing the Azure Ore's energy into the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Bloodwrought Bow reacted as if it had been plunged into hot oil, emitting a series of sizzling sounds. The entire bow vibrated violently, and wisps of faint smoke began to waft from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the already eerie red hue of the Bloodwrought Bow intensified, as if blood coursed through its frame, radiating a terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne suddenly sliced his fingertip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single drop of blood fell onto the Bloodwrought Bow, and immediately, the bow shook violently, taking on an even more mysterious aura&mdash;as if the very next moment, it might dissolve into liquid crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne felt an unbreakable bond strengthen between him and the bow; it became an extension of himself, responding to his thoughts as effortlessly as a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the secret technique from 'the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging'!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's the Blood Fusion Technique!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>By using the Blood Fusion Technique on a divine artifact, it becomes even more in tune with its master. It transforms into a true part of the body, fully responsive to the owner's will! And if the artifact is ever taken by an enemy, it can break free and return on its own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the Bloodwrought Bow resonate deeply with him as he tested the technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Fusion Technique is definitely effective!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A triumphant smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the bow calmed, its energy having undergone a profound transformation thanks to the Azure Ore. Osborne could sense its newfound strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he tightened his grip, it felt like their bloodlines were intertwined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a shimmering arrow infused with Sacred Power materialized on the bowstring, launching forth at breakneck speed. It zipped through the air until it struck a massive rock in the distance, exploding upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gigantic boulder shattered into dust, leaving a massive crater in the swamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! The power has increased by at least thirty percent!" Osborne marveled, thrilled by the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by adding one Azure Ore, the bow's power had surged dramatically. In a fair fight, that thirty percent difference could mean the line between life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling his earlier battles, he remembered that he had defeated twenty-eight Mud Golems, yielding an equivalent number of Azure Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I infuse all twenty-eight pieces of Azure Ore into the Bloodwrought Bow? How powerful could it become? Maybe ten times stronger? By then, the Bloodwrought Bow will be among the most top-notch Apex divine artifacts in the entire cosmos!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>At that time, won't it be close to becoming a Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne retrieved a second Azure Ore. He used his Sacred Power to channel its energy, infusing it into the bow and then performed the Blood Fusion Technique once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He infused the ores one after another, until all twenty-eight were seamlessly merged with the Bloodwrought Bow. Now, the bow floated before him, radiating a brilliant crimson glow like a blood-red sun, dazzling to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without his intervention, the bow emitted an overwhelming wave of power, distorting the space around it into a dizzying array of fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt an intimate bond deepen with the Bloodwrought Bow, as if it were a third arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have to consciously control it; just thinking about it was enough for the bow to draw back its string and conjure arrows on his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne preferred to hold the bow firmly in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he tightened his grip, his entire demeanor shifted&mdash;it became sharper, more imposing, and filled with a potent aura of killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of confidence, he surmised, "The power of the Bloodwrought Bow has nearly increased tenfold!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I call upon its power with Sacred Power, the arrows it unleashes, even if not as powerful as the Dimensional Maw, would still pack a significant punch!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I might even be able to break through Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings defenses with just this bow!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the exhilarating leap in power, he knew the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow </span><span>was</span><span> still far from becoming a Sacred Artifact. To achieve that, </span><span>he would</span><span> need more Azure Ore&mdash;plenty more Azure Ore...</span></p><div class="pagination">
