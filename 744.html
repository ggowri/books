  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine training bases were scattered in various locations, making it impossible for Osborne to visit each one personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he used his Draco Star Wristlet to send a command to all nine training bases, instructing everyone, including members of the Blood Demon Organization, to gather at Training Base No. 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 1 was the largest of them all. It wasn't located in Newport City but on a private island out at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waited a full day before heading to Training Base No. 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he arrived, over five thousand people had already assembled there. They stood in neat rows, awaiting Osborne's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne did not sneak in to test their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that would be courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, at Training Base No. 6, Osborne had nearly been overwhelmed. If not for his Vampire Transformation, which exerted a powerful aura of intimidation over everyone at Training Base No. 6, he might have died on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 had only five hundred people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, there were five thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Training Base No. 6 had only three Class AA individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, there were ten who had reached Class AAA and over fifty who were Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how confident Osborne was, he knew he couldn't confront them head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne appeared, the more than five thousand people from various training bases, including members of the Blood Demon Organization, immediately saluted him, shouting loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then began to inspect the group. After making a round, even though he had already guessed it, he couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these people, there were ten who had reached Class AAA, fifty-two who were Class AA, fifteen hundred who were Class A+ or Class A, and the rest were Class A- or Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that this was an immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could lead this force to crush ninety-nine percent of Rosmandi's Ancient Families effortlessly; only those like the Augustine family would be able to stand against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that all this power belonged to him made Osborne's breath quicken and his expression grow fervent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people shared a common trait; they were martial artists, but each of them also possessed a transformational power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could transform into Vampires, Gorgons, Titans, Werewolves, or Taurens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been secretly cultivated by Godfather to be Evolved Humans meant to combat the Aberrants. Unfortunately, Godfather had underestimated the strength of the Evolved Humans, rendering them ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Godfather, having the far stronger Draco Armed Services Branch was sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, these people were given to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered how to enhance their strength. He had an ambition, a hope that one day, their power could surpass that of Godfather's Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew this would be a tough challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he also felt it was exciting and interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a plan formed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, listen to my command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately stood straight, their eyes burning with anticipation as they looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you no longer belong to your respective training bases. You are all now members of the Blood Demon Organization! I will serve as the Grand Commander of the Blood Demon Organization, with Clarissa as the Deputy Commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Demon Organization will be structured into ten Combat Battalions. The current heads of each training base will automatically become Battalion Commanders! Each battalion will consist of three Combat Companies. Select your Deputy Battalion Commanders and Combat Company Commanders among yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began issuing orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were well-trained soldiers. Upon receiving Osborne's commands, they quickly selected Battalion Commanders, Deputy Battalion Commanders, and Combat Company Commanders, standing tall before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were fifty of them in total, and they would be the future backbone of the Blood Demon Organization. All of them were at least Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked them to introduce themselves and told them to abandon their previous code names and choose a new name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were orphans raised by Godfather. They only had code names before. Now, when asked to name themselves, almost all chose "Augustine" as their surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on their rank and strength, they named themselves First Augustine, Second Augustine, Third Augustine, and so on...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Osborne a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't stop them; he just silently memorized their names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I now announce the first order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "I have a method that can allow all of you to possess the power to transform into Vampires. After transforming, I can help you increase your strength faster. In this way, even those members of Class A- could break through to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I want to ask you all. Are you willing to let me help you transform into Vampires?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, many looked stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected that transforming into Vampires would enable them to increase their strength faster, and even the Class A- members could break through to above Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other, excitement gleaming in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First spoke loudly. "Mr. Augustine, we are all willing! Mr. Augustine, whatever you tell us to do, we will do. We will follow your orders without question!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! Have everyone get ready. I will now begin transforming you so that you all have the power to become Vampires!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
