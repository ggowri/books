  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space scaling, keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was drenched in sweat, his complexion pale. It had been a long time since he had exerted himself to this extent, and the area before him had shrunk to just one yard in size, but he pushed on, determined to compress it even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the space continued to shrink until it was reduced to the size of a fist. At that moment, Osborne collapsed to the ground, utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did it! A fist-sized space! This is my limit for now," he gasped, taking a moment to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to grasp the small, gem-like orb that now occupied his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, that's heavy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as he nearly toppled over again under the weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fist-sized space had once spanned thousands of miles, equivalent to a small planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was holding what felt like a miniature world in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming weight made it feel as if he was cradling a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, with a slight exertion of his spatial energy, the orb floated effortlessly above his palm, its heaviness seemingly vanishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne studied the orb closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could clearly see the twisted, decaying roots coiled inside, along with the small sapling still protected by its vibrant barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him lay a massive pit, a void stretching for 10 thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Space seemed to flow like water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space he had severed didn't simply vanish into nothingness; it was as if he had scooped a cup of water from the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sea remained unaffected, replenishing itself from other areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the decaying roots, the sapling, and even the surrounding soil had vanished, along with any traces of the battle that had taken place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I need to gather all the Miracle Elixir and Celestial Crystals from this area, then get out of here and find a safe spot to study that sapling!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully stored the scaled-down space into Hope Haven and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the last untouched area of Primordial Divine Peak, and it didn't take him long to scour it clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had collected over 20 thousand Miracle Elixirs and more than 30 million Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to leave Primordial Divine Peak!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he swiftly made his exit, eager to put distance between himself and the site of his recent exploits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expedition to Primordial Divine Peak had yielded an astounding bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 250 thousand Miracle Elixirs, mostly the rare and precious yellow and blue varieties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he had nearly 400 million Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about hitting the jackpot!" he thought, but in his eyes, the true treasure wasn't the Miracle Elixirs or Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the massive, decaying root and the small sapling thriving atop it, drawing life from that ancient husk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't yet know what the sapling truly was, Osborne was certain it had to be on par with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, if not even more extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No ordinary tree could hold such significance; this was a genuine treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he left Primordial Divine Peak, Osborne activated interdimensional travel, moving away from the peak for several hundred million miles before finally pausing to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately entered Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were eyeing the gem-like orb that contained the scaled-down space with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne entered, they instantly swarmed around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what is this? It looks so weird! Like a mini-space with roots and a little sapling inside!" Anastasia exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but grin. "This is a scaled space! I used my spatial power to shrink it down! It originally spanned 10 thousand miles across."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he said that, Anastasia and the others' eyes went wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand miles? Are you kidding me? That's even bigger than Hope Haven! You managed to condense it into something the size of a fist? Osborne, your spatial power is getting more terrifying by the day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe interjected, furrowing her brow, "But wait, if the space was originally 10 thousand miles, doesn't that mean the roots inside must be 10 thousand miles long? What kind of tree has roots that long?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia added, intrigued yet skeptical, "That's impossible, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that little sapling must be... over a thousand yards tall?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, though he, too, found it hard to believe. "I get it; it sounds absurd, but it's the truth! Those roots are remnants of a colossal, powerful organism. Even in their decayed state, they possess an immense, pure energy that actually surpasses the Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they're incredibly tough! Even with all my strength, I couldn't cut through them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him stared in shock, their expressions a mix of awe and confusion. "What on earth is this thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I really don't know what it is. I came back specifically to study it. Why don't you all go ahead and train? I'll take it from here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
