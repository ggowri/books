  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught every word of Bradley's taunt, a flicker of realization igniting in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Number Six Elixir? Made from the blood of a Vampire deity? The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> got access to a Vampire god's corpse, so he's cloning Dukes of Blood Clan. That means the Number Six Elixir was extracted from the blood of that very corpse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious as these thoughts raced through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This theory seemed spot on. Blood Cross must have sensed the divine blood within the elixir, which was why it had reacted so suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this had ended up working in Osborne's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Blood Cross absorbing all the Vampire god's blood from the Number Six Elixir, the elixir's power had diminished significantly, leaving Bradley's strength back at square one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with a weakened opponent, Osborne felt a rush of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed, saying, "Relying on some potion for strength? That's just plain unreliable! Now that your little drug has worn off, how do you plan to keep up with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley's expression shifted from arrogant confidence to shock. Without the effects of the elixir, not only had his power faded back to normal, but his speed had taken a hit as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no dodging Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was raise his arms in a desperate attempt to block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's overwhelming force shattered Bradley's defenses, exploding within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, without the divine power shielding his insides, Bradley took a brutal hit, blood spilling from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single strike, Osborne had seriously injured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Bradley was far from finished. Even with the effects of the elixir gone, he was tough enough to keep fighting. Shifting his strategy, he decided not to engage in a brawl anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Bradley resorted to every trick in the book to try to entangle Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You think you can drain my energy? In your dreams! You're the one who's going down!" Osborne roared, unleashing the full force of his strength into Bradley's frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he sent Bradley flying across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne charged at him, Bradley gritted his teeth and summoned every ounce of strength to propel himself away from the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he also realized that Osborne wouldn't let him off easily; Osborne would relish tormenting and humiliating him. Faced with that fate, Bradley thought it wiser to concede defeat and leave the arena on his own terms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne halted his advance and smirked at Bradley. "Nice escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But weren't you shouting about revenge for Felicity? Weren't you going to torture and humiliate me? And yet here you are, fleeing the arena like a scared dog?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The third disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's disdainful comments ignited fury in Bradley, but he couldn't muster a retort, as it was undeniable that he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could manage was a cold huff. "Osborne, enjoy your little victory while it lasts! You've burned through most of your energy. You're barely at thirty percent of your peak power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you do win against me, Marlon will wipe the floor with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moment this Honor Quest Ceremony wraps up, you're finished! I'll find my opportunity to humiliate you, and you'll wish you had never been born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bradley turned on his heel and made his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted but didn't pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own Honor Quest Ceremony wasn't over yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had one last challenger&mdash;Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned his gaze towards Marlon, Osborne's expression grew grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley had been right; he was only at thirty percent of his full strength now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I've still got a good ten minutes before I can use Light of Redemption again. Can I really take on Marlon in this state?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down below, the crowd watched Osborne, who was utterly worn out, scarcely believing he could pull off any miracles to defeat Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Marlon sauntered onto the arena; his gaze locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would've thought you'd actually make it this far? If you manage to take me down, you'll clear the Honor Quest Ceremony, becoming the first from </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and the fourth in the world to do so. You'd be a legend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But standing in your way is me, Marlon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, you're like a fly trapped on a glass window&mdash;so close to the light, yet utterly lost. Even if you were at your peak, you wouldn't stand a chance against me. And let's not even talk about the fact that you're limping along at a measly thirty percent of your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's disdain was palpable as he scrutinized Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, in this state, why bother struggling? It'd be smarter to just admit defeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a cold smile, "Defeat? You think </span><span>you're</span><span> worthy of that? Even at thirty percent, I can take you down! Just don't go crying like your sister did when I knocked her around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of his sister, Marlon's face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Osborne humiliating her on the arena floor flooded back, igniting a firestorm of fury within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's eyes blazed with a murderous intent that could cut through steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you want to die? Fine, I'll be the one to grant you that wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Marlon declared, "Now, let me show you just how terrifying the strongest of the younger generation can be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he lunged forward, ready to unleash his power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
