  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong?" At this moment, Clara and Leroy finally noticed something was off with Osborne, so they asked with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. When he looked up again, he had completely returned to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when he looked at Ian again, he showed no signs of anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "It's nothing. I just felt unwell earlier, but I'm fine now. How's the situation? How are the others doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy still looked at Osborne with concern after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Clara pointed to the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their performances are all up there?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked up and was stunned. It turned out that Chief Judge Gerald had used Sacred Power to project everyone's recorded results into the sky, making it easier for everyone to check their rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't noticed earlier because he was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, more than two hundred contestants had already been recorded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person ranked first was named Jordan. Her achievements had been converted into a total of 36.5 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person ranked second was far behind Jordan, with less than 10 million Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan? I remember she also had a chance to win, and her championship odds seemed to have entered the top five. The only ones ahead of her were Brenda, Valentino, Dustin, and Mckinley," Osborne recalled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded. "That's right! Jordan does have a chance to win, but this time she was completely overshadowed by Brenda. She's just a member of Brenda's team."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their team members receive resources based on contributions, so Jordan was able to earn over 30 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. She's already amazing! She might even make it into the top ten..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, sat cross-legged, and said calmly, "He's only counted over two hundred people so far, with at least six hundred more to go. It seems it'll take at least half a day, so I need to rest for a while. Call me when it's almost over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne was afraid that if he kept watching Ian, he wouldn't be able to control his killing intent, and Ian might notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Ian had already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His perception was incredibly sharp. As long as Osborne dared to reveal even a trace of killing intent, Ian would surely sense it. Based on Osborne's understanding of Ian, Ian was a ruthless person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Ian sensed Osborne's killing intent, he wouldn't ponder why Osborne wanted to kill him but would immediately and violently kill Osborne to eliminate the threat once and for all. Eliminate the threat!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne decided not to look at Ian anymore. He planned to carefully adjust his emotions and hide all his anger and killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, she felt that something was off with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Osborne didn't tell them, they ultimately didn't ask any questions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. If anything happens, we'll let you know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy didn't rest but kept an eye on the score statistics, even though they believed the zone duel champion would definitely be Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, since Osborne would be the champion, they were certain to be the runner-up and third place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone's scores hadn't been fully tallied yet, so they couldn't guarantee whether a hidden lucky person, like Osborne, had stumbled upon a large amount of resources somewhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Didn't Osborne pick up fifteen million Ice Beetles?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If another lucky person shows up, Osborne might not necessarily win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they carefully observed the statistics.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, the situation they worried about never happened. Ian, Gerald, and others' scores were tallied quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So far, Jordan is still in first place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Brenda, Dustin, Mckinley, and others who might win the championship have yet to step forward to tally their scores, and even many of the top ten haven't done so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Clara and Leroy continued to wait patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda looked more confident, her face full of smiles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at everyone's scores, she felt she would surely win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, almost all the contestants not in her team had their scores tallied, with the highest being only around 30 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His score was already quite good, with a chance to enter the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this score was far too low compared to Brenda's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, besides those not in the team and acting alone, Brenda roughly understood the situation of others and knew approximately how much they had achieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They absolutely couldn't pose a threat to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Brenda's face lit up with a confident smile, and she couldn't help but look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she froze, because not all those acting alone had their scores tallied yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, and Leroy had not yet tallied their achievements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, she looked relieved. "There's no way those acting alone could achieve more than me! After all, I have the Ice Scepter, and my team of 800 supports me...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will surely be the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda regained her confidence again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As more results were tallied, everyone started discussing more intensely. Those hoping to make it into the top ten were extremely nervous at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only a little over a hundred people haven't had their results tallied yet..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The current first-place holder has earned 38 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The person in tenth place has earned 32 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my, their competition is so intense! The gap between first and tenth place is only 8 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Next, there's Brenda, Dustin, Mckinley who still have a chance to win, and those who might make it into the top ten..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The rankings could change at any moment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't forget Osborne's results haven't been tallied yet. He's so arrogant and confident, and his score won't be low. He's still sitting there even now. I'm afraid his points might be higher than the current first place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I even suspect his score will eventually exceed 50 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! So what if it's 50 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's not on our team, he has no idea how much Brenda has achieved. Even if he has 50 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he still can't compare to Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The final champion will definitely be Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! Brenda is definitely the champion. Osborne is overestimating himself. How can he compare to Brenda? He even said Brenda wouldn't make it to the top three."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha. So ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As everyone discussed, the score tallying continued quickly and steadily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, most of the scores had been tallied, with fewer than ten people left. Everyone started getting excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there! Only a few people left. The rankings are about to be finalized! What I'm most looking forward to now is Brenda's exact score!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll know soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian said calmly, "Mckinley redeemed 63 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"63 million!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone exclaimed in surprise and looked at Mckinley with envy. Although they already knew Mckinley's score was high, they only just found out the exact number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mckinley is definitely in the top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, we'll see if Dustin can surpass him. If Dustin can't, Mckinley will be second!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Dustin's score was tallied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dustin redeemed 64 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
