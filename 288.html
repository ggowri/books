  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his eyes in disbelief, wondering if he was seeing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations! You've been named the heir of Dampston's ancient family, the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked again. No, he hadn't misread that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather had just bestowed upon him the incredible title of heir to an ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Dampston's Augustine family? I've never even heard of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather is connected to the Augustine family in Newport City, but surely, there can't be only one Augustine family in the world. If this Dampston Augustine family is also an old family, they have to be powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no ancient family is weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why would the Godfather make me the heir to the Dampston Augustine family? What's the connection? And what does this make me in relation to them? Am I really cut out for this role?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is the Godfather really handing over the entire Dampston Augustine family to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir, once the current head of the family stepped down, everything will be mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I know nothing about this family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wouldn't it have been better if the Godfather had just given me a mid-sized company instead? Ah, whatever. I'll figure it out later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather must have his reasons for this decision, and perhaps it ties into my fifth trial as an heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can just complete that trial, I will finally meet the Godfather face-to-face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if I can tackle the sixth trial, I'll have the chance to get Anastasia into the Godfather's cutting-edge medical lab to cure her mysterious illness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne clenched his fists, determination ignited in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So I'm an heir to an ancient family now? But how do I even contact Dampston's Augustine family? Will they even recognize me as one of their own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston is just east of Skyefall, not too far from Mayby City. A few hours by car. If I have some time, I should check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he set aside his concerns for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had arrived at the Radcliffe Manor and felt a strong urge to see Clarissa. Just one hour apart felt like too long; he missed her already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, she might have information about the Augustine family in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, both the Augustine and Radcliffe families were old-money clans, so Clarissa might know something about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he stepped into the estate, his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the expansive lawn, three helicopters were parked, all emblazoned with the Radcliffe family crest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that a bigwig from the Radcliffe family is visiting? Who could it be? Clarissa's father? Or maybe her grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he had publicly declared his relationship with Clarissa, the Radcliffe family had a high-profile guest arriving. This definitely wasn't good news for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's probably related to me and Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, Osborne had made up his mind to face whatever came next alongside her. He wouldn't shy away; he would confront it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne strode purposefully toward the main house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Clarissa stood in the living room, biting her lip as she gazed defiantly at a tall figure not far away. Her eyes were filled with stubbornness and determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, please just go home! I won't break up with Osborne! I won't leave with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My life is my own to decide! You don't need to interfere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man storming in was none other than her father, Dylan Radcliffe, the head of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at her, his voice icy as he barked, "I'm your father! I'm also the head of the Radcliffe family. Why shouldn't I have a say in your life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll say it again! You and Osborne are not possible! Not a single soul in the Radcliffe family or The Wise Order approves of this. You need to end this ridiculous obsession right now and leave with me - permanently cut ties with Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care how he's enchanted you. He's simply not good enough for you! I've found a much better match for you, someone who checks all the boxes. The entire Radcliffe family is on board, even your grandfather is satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, outrage flared in Clarissa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you to choose my husband? Your satisfaction, or even Grandpa's, means nothing to me! My happiness is what matters. If you all have such great tastes, marry someone yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little brat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan thundered, his hand rising as if poised to strike her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just in the nick of time, Donna burst through the door, stepping in to block him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, hold it right there! This isn't how you resolve things. No need for violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, Clarissa is your daughter. You should respect her choices instead of treating her like property to be bartered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at her aunt with gratitude shimmering in her eyes. "Aunt Donna!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dylan scoffed, saying, "You, too? You're siding with this spoiled brat? Do you even grasp the gravity of this situation? Clarissa doesn't understand her own predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think she deserves to marry a waste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna hesitated before finally saying, "Dylan, Osborne isn't a waste."</span></p><div class="pagination">
