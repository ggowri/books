  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond sneered, "Princess Alfreda, are you taking such an unworthy human waste to Umbra Earth for a sightseeing tour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "And don't forget, you owe my sister ten Flame Gold Crystals! If you fail to find them, you will either be kicked out of Elf City or spend several years in the Dungeon of Stillness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his words, Desmond burst into hearty laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not wait for Alfreda to retort. Instead, he grabbed Monica's hand and left in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glared after them, her face burning with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes shone with cold fury. Anyone would be enraged to be called waste right to their face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he kept his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Elf City, and he knew he must remain rational!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond was a prince of the Fire Elf Royal Family, a man of high standing here. Osborne understood that no matter how venomous Desmond's words were if he struck out against him, the blame would fall squarely on his own shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Desmond, just you wait," Osborne vowed silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we leave Elf City and step into Umbra Earth, I will show you that the 'waste' you sneer at can easily beat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't let his words get to you. When we reach Umbra Earth, I will gladly help you give him a real drubbing to settle the score!" Alfreda comforted him, her anger evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a small relief. Smiling, he shook his head and replied, "No, I will take revenge myself when we arrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, she thought, "Osborne wants to take revenge himself? But... how?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that although Desmond was not a genius, he was by no means weak. His level had reached Ascension Four, a full three stages above Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't think Osborne could handle revenge on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alfreda said nothing further. She only vowed silently that she would make sure to beat Desmond and Monica soundly when the chance arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the crowd continued to murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their focus had turned to Osborne. He was only at Ascension One. Just yesterday, Peggy had scolded him here, making him the laughingstock of the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he had joined Alfreda's exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Desmond is right. Does Princess Alfreda really accept just anyone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she even taking on an Ascension One waste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say that someone with Ascension One strength can hardly protect themselves in Umbra Earth. If real danger strikes, he will only slow his team down and be utterly useless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that a corrosive aura shrouds the outskirts of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even someone at the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King struggles to endure it for long. Only Ascension Two individuals can manage for a short while, and only with special measures. Otherwise, they are quickly consumed by corrosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is only at Ascension One. If he goes in, he might die instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that is just the outskirts. Deeper inside Umbra Earth lie even greater perils. An Ascension One stands almost no chance of survival! If Alfreda brings him along, she will have to babysit him constantly and accomplish nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This waste will only hold his team back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The low murmurs reached both Osborne and Alfreda. Osborne remained calm and indifferent, but Alfreda seethed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up immediately, ready to refute the insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped her just in time. He shook his head and said, "Let them talk. I do not care. I have noted every one of them. If we run into them in Umbra Earth, I will take my revenge on each of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda wanted to say more, but in the end, she sat back down, still fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These despicable fools!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my friend, and they have the nerve to talk like that about you! If it were not for the Elven Mother Tree being in its dormant phase, leaving the Nature Elf power at its weakest, I would have taught them a lesson they would not forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still seething, Alfreda declared, "Osborne, I cannot stand being here any longer! Their words make my blood boil. I have decided to unleash my trump card now, and then we shall leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "As for how many members we recruit, let fate decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it is only me, I will surely gain something in Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda stood once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her cold voice rang out across the entire Combat Arena. "Everyone, listen up! I am Princess Alfreda. I am now recruiting warriors from the World of Racial Convergence to join my exploration team in search of treasures in Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My requirements are strict. Each team member must be at least at the Ascension Five level, and their overall score in the Astral Testing Arch must reach at least Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know many of you think these standards are too high. But you must believe that I deserve nothing less! I promise that all treasures acquired in Umbra Earth by my team </span><span>members </span><span>will belong entirely to </span><span>them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Nature Elf Royal Family will take not a single bit! I mean every treasure. Whether it is the Soul of Umbra Earth, an Element Gold Crystal, a Sacred Elixir, a Sacred Crystal, an Apex divine artifact, or a Sacred Artifact, if we acquire them together, they will be split equally, and if you obtain something on your own, it will be all yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alfreda finished speaking, the Combat Arena fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless onlookers stared at her in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Princess Alfreda claims that all treasures in Umbra Earth will be shared equally if obtained as a team. And if we get something on our own, it belongs only to us. Not a single </span><span>thing</span><span> is taken by the Nature Elf Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it true? Is there really such a generous deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the exploration teams of other Elf Royal Families, at least half of the treasures are taken first, and the rest is divided according to the captain's whims!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If a particularly rare treasure is found, the Elf Royal Family gets the first pick, and only what remains is for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Princess Alfreda promises equal sharing for team gains and complete ownership for individual finds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many faces lit up with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sharing rule was far better than that of other teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when they considered Alfreda's recruitment criteria, they could only sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She required applicants to be at least at Ascension Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they needed an overall score of Class B in the Astral Testing Arch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were very few in all of Elf City who met these standards. Even if they were tempted, most would not qualify to join Alfreda's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, could you lower the requirements a bit?" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Alfreda replied, "Very well. Those at Ascension Four and with a Class A overall score in the Astral Testing Arch may also join my exploration team. I promise that every individual treasure you earn in Umbra Earth will be entirely yours. The Nature Elf Royal Family will take nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scanned the crowd and continued, "If you are interested, meet me at Emerald Forest Lodge! Those who do not meet the standards need not waste their time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda called Osborne and left the Combat Arena with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she departed, her recruitment terms spread like wildfire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
