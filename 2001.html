  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending his call with Jethro, Osborne returned to the Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is time to get moving!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found Anastasia, Zoe, and the others. After time accelerated two hundred times, their time spent in seclusion had become too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the gains had been immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Hannah, Diana, and Bryce had all reached Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level and were advancing toward Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their talents were extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each had a Divine Body at level ten, almost reaching the limit of what this world could offer. To break through to the Infinite Sacred Body, they would need to undergo a process similar to Osborne's&mdash;fusing with the World Tree's offshoot&mdash;but that was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, their Divine Bodies had reached a certain peak. In Celestara, apart from Osborne, no one else had a stronger Divine Body or higher talent than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the former Seven Great Deity Kings could not compare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the God of Night or the Lord Malevolence could hold a candle to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their terrifying talents erupted after reaching Supernal Deity King Level, and their cultivation speed had not slowed. On the contrary, it seemed to be accelerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would not be long before they reached Ascension Two Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! It is time to make our move," Osborne called out to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Seven Young Deity Kings should reappear in everyone's sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, their eyes lit up with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These years, they had not just been idly increasing their cultivation. They had been sparring daily, and their battles were not just light exchanges&mdash;they were going all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's absolute guardianship, even if they were severely injured or even killed, they could recover quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength had improved rapidly in these intense sparring sessions, and they had mastered their Divine Ascendance Techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were itching to face real enemies now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they left the Hope Haven, heading directly to the Pioneers of Starlight's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Seven Young Deity Kings, should not get too entangled with the Hudson family! Although the Paramount Supreme Clan has probably already suspected that we have been hiding in the Hudson Manor," Osborne said, looking at the group, "I have decided that we should break away from the Hudson family. We need to create our force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others' eyes brightened. "Create our force? That is great! Although the Hudson family is good, and Jethro has treated us well, we never truly felt a sense of belonging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! It is better to create our force!" someone agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! With our current strength, the force we create will be a Dukedom Level Power!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with you, Osborne, I believe our force will be stronger than the Hudson family, even stronger than the Sanctum of Light or the Sanctum of Night!" someone else said, their voice filled with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Stronger than the Sanctum of Light or the Sanctum of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is what I want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Since no one has any objections, let's create our force here! What should we name our organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about the Pioneers of Starlight?" one suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that is too uncreative! I think it should be called the Thunder League!" another said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it should be called Flame Mount!" yet another proposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think... " They all started offering suggestions, and Osborne could not help but feel speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and said, "The organization's name will be Demon Slayer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Demon Slayer! To slay Lord Malevolence!" Osborne's eyes flashed coldly. "A thousand years ago, Lord Malevolence led the Unity Clan to invade Celestara. They slaughtered the Human Community, enslaved us, seized our lands, and monopolized our resources! Lord Malevolence has gathered over five hundred billion Dark Deity Legion at the West Zone, aiming to completely conquer the West Zone and take away the last living space of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Except for Hannah, we are all humans! We cannot accept the tyranny and cruelty of Lord Malevolence! Our goal is not to eradicate the billions of lives in the Unity Clan, as they are under the control of Lord Malevolence and can only follow his commands! We will slay Lord Malevolence, defeat him, and expel him from Celestara forever. We will even destroy him if we must!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only when Lord Malevolence is dead can Celestara return to peace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, our organization will be named Demon Slayer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, everyone's eyes lit up, and they silently repeated the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Demon Slayer! To slay Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I have no objections! Let's go with the Demon Slayer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, and a dimensional portal appeared before him. The Blood Demon members walked out, all having reached the highest Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, they had trained in the Hope Haven, battling with Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, as well as with Osborne's Spatial Clones and Dark Undead. Their cooperation had reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Demon Slayer does not need too many people," Osborne said. "Apart from the eight of us, there will only be ten thousand Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And our first battle will be on the current battlefield&mdash;the border competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a power wave, the sign at the entrance of the former Pioneers of Starlight base changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sign bore the inscription&mdash;Demon Slayer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the Demon Slayer was established.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, along with ten thousand Blood Demon members, arrived near the border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Jethro entered the Sanctum of Light to seek an audience with God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, what can I do for you?" God of Light asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking somewhat weary, God of Light had been pondering for a long time, unsure how to win the border competition the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jethro, she forced herself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro cupped his hands and said, "Congratulations, God of Light! A new Dukedom Level Power has emerged in the West Zone of Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was immediately surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another Dukedom Level Power? Which First-rate Power has someone broken through to become a Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, it is not that! It is a brand-new organization, and its name is... Demon Slayer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Demon Slayer?!" God of Light was surprised. She had never heard of such an organization before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she did not think much of it. To the Human Community, having one more Supernal Deity King and one more Dukedom Level Power did not change much. It would not alter the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a smile. "Anyway, this is good news! Who is the leader of Demon Slayer? I want to meet him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The leader of Demon Slayer is named... " Jethro hesitated. "Osborne Augustine!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
