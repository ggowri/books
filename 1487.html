  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Calvin finished speaking, Fabian's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers from various factions shifted uncomfortably, sensing the rising tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that, Calvin?" Fabian shot back coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin felt the pressure mount, even as a peak Celestial Deity warrior. Facing so many eyes from other factions left him with a sense of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He steadied his voice, saying, "My meaning is clear. I have no intention of saving Lachlan, and the Swift family isn't going to lift a finger for him! However, he has stolen a considerable amount of Essence Crystals from our vault to buy slaves here. I know those slaves can't be returned, so we're not concerned about getting the crystals back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But make no mistake, those slaves belong to the Swift family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur of discontent rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many among them had already contacted their family's hunting teams, waiting for Fabian to kill Lachlan. Once that happened, they planned to swoop in and claim the slaves when they became unclaimed property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Calvin dared to claim those slaves for the Swift family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't let that stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held their tongues for the moment, directing their gazes toward Fabian, waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you're living in a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are we to believe you? That guy clearly struck it lucky with an ancient god's vault, so those slaves have nothing to do with you or the Swift family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want to be unreasonable. Among all those slaves he bought, I can let the rest go, but those three Celestial Deity-level human female slaves? They're mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to challenge me, just know that I, Fabian, won't hold back!" Fabian said, casting a cold glance around the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face turned a deep shade of maroon as he registered the seriousness of the situation. He already knew what Fabian was referencing&mdash;the three top-tier Celestial Deity female slaves Lachlan had bought for a staggering 50 million Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian openly demanding those women was akin to snatching away 50 million Essence Crystals right from under his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling overwhelmed by Fabian's formidable presence, Calvin struggled to find the words to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everyone around him, representing their respective factions, glaring at him with hostility, his resolve wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to discuss this with my father first! Regardless, Lachlan stole from the Swift family vault, which means those slaves are theoretically ours!" Calvin asserted, though his voice was tinged with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian laughed coldly. "Ask your father? Is that your play, Calvin? You think you can use him to intimidate me? I'll give you this&mdash;your father is strong, and I may not be able to beat him just yet. But if he dares to come at me, let's see if the Wild Bull Clan agrees to stand down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's hear what the other factions think about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face grew even gloomier, his fists clenching tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the crowd, another voice rang out. "Calvin, don't assume we're all fools. We know exactly what the Swift family is up to! After that guy's dead, all those slaves he bought will become unclaimed. You're dreaming if you think the Swift family can just take them back. It'll be every faction for itself! Whoever's quickest on the draw gets to claim them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just take them all back? None of us will stand for it! If the Swift family has the guts to go toe-to-toe with us, then by all means, give it a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let your little bit of strength go to your head. You're still just a lowly human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from the crowd, and Calvin's expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt utterly cornered, unable to counter their mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things had spiraled out of his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Walter had underestimated the situation, thinking they could simply concoct a reason to reclaim the slaves worth a staggering 120 million Essence Crystals. It was a foolish fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other factions had no intention of respecting the Swift family; they were more interested in humiliating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin clenched his fists, but he held his tongue. He quickly reached out to Walter to discuss their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came down to it, they'd have to rely on their own skills to seize what they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Lachlan! That bastard gets his hands on so many Essence Crystals and doesn't even turn them over to the Swift family. Instead, he runs off to buy slaves! Now I'm the one getting humiliated, and the whole Swift family is being looked down on by the other factions. He deserves to die! If luck is on his side today and he survives, I'll find a way to finish him off myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin fumed internally as he communicated with Walter, trying to devise a strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, unnoticed by the crowd, a beautiful woman dressed in vibrant robes stood at a distance with an elderly man, observing the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Hannah, the heiress of the Gellar family from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah narrowed her eyes at the scene before her, her brows furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Swift family is truly disappointing. No matter what, Lachlan is still one of their own, yet they're just standing by and watching him die."</span></p><div class="pagination">
