  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Corrosive Marsh?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda exchanged a surprised glance at the warning left by Uriel. It cautioned that anyone below Ascension Six Supernal Deity King should not recklessly enter the Corrosive Marsh, or face almost certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he really that generous? Ten times more dangerous than Death Chasm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda frowned. In her opinion, the Death Chasm was already extremely perilous, housing Phantom Worms and Soulreaver Vines. Especially the Phantom Worms, their stealth ability was incredibly terrifying. Even as a member of the Nature Elf Clan, she hadn't been able to detect them before they launched an attack. She'd nearly lost her life to those sneaky creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Soulreaver Vine, it had withstood the onslaught of over a hundred members from Desmond and Monica's exploration teams for almost an hour before finally being slain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, the Death Chasm was a place of great danger. Even seasoned Ascension Four and Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings wouldn't claim to be able to protect themselves within its treacherous confines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Corrosive Marsh was supposed to be ten times more dangerous than the Death Chasm? Alfreda found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet there's a treasure trove in the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel probably just doesn't want us to compete with him!" Alfreda speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "It could very well be dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless, we're going in. But since Uriel warned us, we should definitely tread carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, her resolve firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King herself, she didn't think twice about ordinary Ascension Six foes. With Osborne's strength surpassing hers, they both stood above the typical Ascension Six level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's warning wouldn't deter them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not waste any time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking at the signs around here, it seems Uriel's team didn't linger long in Death Chasm and has already been in the Corrosive Marsh for a while! This suggests that the treasures in the Corrosive Marsh must be way more valuable than the Element Gold Crystals we found in Death Chasm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides Uriel's team, it looks like other exploration teams have entered the Corrosive Marsh as well! We need to hurry up and catch up, or we'll miss out on all the good stuff..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took the lead, stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead lay a muddy swamp, its dark purple sludge undulating slowly. The surface was dotted with rocks, decaying matter, and peculiar plants radiating a purplish-blue glow, featuring massive leaves reminiscent of lotus pads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tested the ground and discovered that the floating rocks and blue-hued leaves could serve as stepping stones. Though they swayed precariously, they wouldn't sink into the swamp, allowing them to venture deeper into the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also large, withered vines bobbing on the surface, appearing to be suitable footholds as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these vines were covered in sharp thorns, and they looked eerily familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those are the vines of the Soulreaver!" Alfreda exclaimed, her expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. The decaying vines floating in the swamp, resembling makeshift bridges, were indeed the Soulreaver's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they really that massive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. The Soulreaver Vines they had encountered before were comparable to an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, with vine diameters of only about 1.5 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these withered Soulreaver Vines were at least six feet in diameter, and the largest ones within sight approached a staggering 33 feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Soulreaver Vine with a diameter of just 1.5 feet is already on par with an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King! If these vines are this enormous, how powerful must they be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Seven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or even Ascension Eight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne and Alfreda both wore a grim face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their confidence, they couldn't ignore the looming threat of encountering Soulreaver Vines of Ascension Seven or even Ascension Eight, especially in this treacherous swamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a few words of caution but didn't waver, stepping into the Corrosive Marsh one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the lead, his Satan's Eye fully activated, scanning their surroundings for any potential threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the X-ray vision of Satan's Eye was severely limited in this environment; he could only see about 16 feet into the murky depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything deeper remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heightening his vigilance, Osborne pressed onward, hopping from one rock to another, and occasionally stepping on the large, purple-blue leaves or the withered Soulreaver Vines, making his way deeper into the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This swamp was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an hour of trekking, they found themselves in a desolate stretch where nothing but darkness surrounded them; the landscape was a wide expanse of shadowy marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, neither of them had encountered any dangers or attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on&mdash;there are signs of a struggle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly stopped, pointing at the rippling surface of the swamp ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda quickly turned her gaze, her expression shifting in alarm. "You're right! Those are definitely signs of a battle, and it must have happened not long ago since the traces haven't been washed away by the swamp yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his Satan's Eye scanning the area with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are bodies down in the swamp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spotted several corpses a few feet below the surface, their faces contorted in terror as they slowly sank further into the murky depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda exclaimed, shocked, "Wait, what? Bodies?! Did you see them? You need to pull them out quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As divine power surged around him, the swamp trembled violently until a fissure opened, revealing three bodies within the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They floated up before Osborne and Alfreda, suspended in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're from the Sylvan Elf Clan!" Alfreda recognized, her face tightening. "I know them&mdash;these are the guards of the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two of them are Ascension Five, and one is Ascension Four. The two Ascension Fives were part of Prince Chuck's exploration team, while the Ascension Four was with Princess Joanna's team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Chuck is an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King! If his team members fell here, their enemies must be incredibly powerful! Chuck and Princess Joanna are likely in grave danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Joanna, Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Joanna?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, recalling the first encounter he had with Joanna when he arrived in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just returned from their own venture into Umbra Earth, and Desmond had threatened </span><span>to punish </span><span>Osborne for merely taking a longer look at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Joanna who had spoken up for him, allowing him to go free, a gesture for which he remained grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when warriors from Racial Convergence Planet were recruited in the Combat Arena, Osborne had even sent a discreet message to Joanna, asking for an exceptional evaluation opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she politely declined, she had not mocked him but rather warned him against the dangers of entering Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Peggy, who openly derided and humiliated him, Joanna had left a good impression on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I remember correctly, Jaden and Renata, along with Letitia, joined Prince Chuck's exploration team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the thoughts rolled in, Osborne's demeanor grew more grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems their battle hasn't ended yet, and they've fled in that direction..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
