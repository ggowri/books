  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald's voice turned icy as he spoke, "Are you really going to refuse me? I'm not like Fabian! Speed won't save you here. If I wanted to kill you, there's nowhere you could run."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a terrifying aura of menace radiated outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tensed up, his face a mask of grimness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Oswald, who had just helped him, to turn around and start pressuring him to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And compared to Fabian, Oswald was undoubtedly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with no weakness in speed like Fabian, Osborne knew he stood no chance against Oswald with his current abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, rapidly contemplating his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I'll have to reveal my identity and use spatial power to forcibly take Betty and the others out of Wild Flame City," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision made, Osborne looked up and said calmly, "I'm sorry, but I have no intention of pledging allegiance to anyone. Whether it's Fabian or you, I won't submit. If you're going to make a move, then bring it on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left Oswald momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming divine power around him vanished instantly, replaced by a smile. "As a lowly member of the Human Community, it's rare to see someone with as much guts as you in the East Zone. But don't worry, I was just pulling your leg, trying to scare you a bit. After all, I'm a general of the City Guard&mdash;I wouldn't force you to submit, would I? Just be more careful in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash of malice in his eyes, Oswald turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Oswald hadn't given up. There must be some reason preventing him from acting against Osborne here, but once given a chance, Oswald would undoubtedly strike without hesitation, just like Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Submit or die&mdash;those were the options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious, a cold snort escaping his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're General Borden of the City Guard, huh? I'll be watching you. Don't even think about laying a hand on me, or you're in for a big surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, Osborne saw that the representatives from other factions had all departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave market was eerily quiet, leaving only the Swift family in the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin stood at a distance, still stunned by what he had witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's events had left him utterly amazed. "Lachlan" had broken through to the Celestial Deity realm, his Divine Body evolving to Level Five, and had used a formidable speed technique to toy with the Deity Overlord warrior Fabian for twenty minutes without even letting Fabian touch a thread of his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, faced with Oswald's threats and attempts at recruitment, "Lachlan" had flatly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all seemed inconceivable to Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at "Lachlan" now, he suddenly felt a sense of unfamiliarity. "Is this really my nephew Lachlan? How has he changed so drastically?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing "Lachlan" glance his way, Calvin scoffed. "Lachlan, you've lost your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First offending Deity Overlord Fabian, and now General Borden. You're just asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luckily, I acted swiftly and exiled you from the Swift family before you could cause any real trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't expect the Swift family to come to your aid. Not even if you beg!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin spoke with a haughty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but burst out laughing at this. "Calvin, what are you trying to prove with that big talk? You didn't dare say a word when Fabian and Oswald were around. You coward, do you really think I'd beg you for help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your dreams! Begging you? I pray you don't die too soon. I pray you grow a pair and act like a man for once. I pray you get out of my sight right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, Osborne's disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face turned crimson with rage as he exploded. "Lachlan, you damn scoundrel! How dare you speak to me like that? I'm your uncle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!" Osborne spat directly at Calvin, his disdain evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just moments ago, you were praising yourself for reacting swiftly and expelling me from the Swift family, cutting off all ties. Now, you claim to be my uncle? How utterly shameless can you be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Swift family's survival in Wild Flame City, their superiority over other human forces&mdash;is it all built on this shamelessness of yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's body trembled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you're looking for a fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm, his disdain unwavering. "I am indeed looking for a fight, but with a waste like you, it's not a fight you can win. Do you really think you're more formidable than Fabian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin suddenly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes bore into Osborne. Realizing he couldn't win the argument, he merely snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! Lachlan, you scoundrel, continue your arrogance and insanity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be watching to see how long you can sustain this madness! When you finally croak, I'll make sure to collect your remains&mdash;if there's anything left to collect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "I'll undoubtedly outlive you and live a far better life. Want to collect my remains? Don't hold your breath; it'll have to wait till your next life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, we'll see about that!" Calvin retorted, his anger seething.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a final, piercing glare at Osborne, he led the Swift family members in their departure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
