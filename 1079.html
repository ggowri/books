  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his desperate bid to save Anastasia, Osborne had reluctantly agreed to the wealthy heiress Ophelia's pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed money&mdash;no, he needed a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because only with Ophelia could he secure the best treatment for his sister. It didn't matter that, after marrying into the Caldwell family, he was treated like a second-class citizen, looked down upon even by Ophelia herself. Osborne remained silent, swallowing the disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to fight back; his sister's life hung in the balance, and every dime mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his heart, Anastasia was everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had entered his life when Osborne was at his lowest&mdash;the moment he felt utterly abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was she who had given him a reason to keep going, who had turned a street kid's life into something meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had sworn to cure her rare illness and give her a life fit for a princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, as the day of his promise approached, as she lay on the brink of waking, that hope was ripped away in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo killed her? He left nothing behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was overwhelmed by grief and anger, a tempest of fury surged within Osborne, consuming everything else in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rational mind vanished, replaced by a single driving force: vengeance. His eyes transformed into a vivid crimson, and his body twisted under the weight of his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's hair erupted, shimmering into long, blood-red strands that danced like flames, a vivid reflection of his seething wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if the darkness within him had a life of its own, sharp fangs elongated from his mouth, while his fingers morphed into deadly claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale, taking on sharper angles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become a Vampire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, the sound filled with pure malice, "Gerardo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne launched himself into action for the first time since breaking through the Class S barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent? One of the top Class S fighters&mdash;Gerardo. Yet all fear dissipated, replaced by unbridled fury and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Gerardo even registered the threat, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was sent flying, a gaping hole now yawning in his chest as he spluttered blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power was incomprehensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before his transformation, his physical strength had been measured at an impressive 220 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ascending to Class S, it shot up to an astonishing 1100 points&mdash;far beyond the threshold of an ordinary divine being!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Gerardo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A measly 180 points, even after merging with the corpse of Goddess Medusa, which only boosted him to around 500.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity was glaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though physical strength did not equate to absolute power, when the difference in physical strength was so vast, the consequences were as Gerardo bore now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's punch had left Gerardo gravely wounded, the damage catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it still wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed at Gerardo with a whirlwind of fury, intent on obliterating Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's relentless assault was raw power unleashed&mdash;no intricate techniques, just pure aggression fueled by his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Gerardo even touched the ground from the first hit, Osborne struck again, this time causing half of Gerardo's body to explode on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those fleeting seconds, regret washed over Gerardo. "Why did I push Osborne? Why did I taunt him about his sister's death? If I had known that such rage lurked beneath the surface, I would've thought twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late now; he couldn't even utter a word of apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of Gerardo's body was obliterated by Osborne's ferocious attack, and the agony surged through him like a thousand daggers. A scream torn from his throat echoed in the chaos, the intense sensation of danger clawing at his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had crossed the threshold into Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was now beyond anything Gerardo could withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo would die right here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by the overwhelming instinct to survive, Gerardo felt an urgent surge within him. As Osborne charged again, he could no longer afford to hold back. He unleashed the deepest reserves of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Gerardo underwent a startling transformation, his body merging with that of the divine corpse. He morphed rapidly into a figure reminiscent of Medusa, but that was only the beginning. Sharp, menacing bull horns sprouted from his head, and his skin thickened, becoming tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Gerardo felt the torment of his injuries fade away, replaced by an overwhelming surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fused not just one but two monstrous forms&mdash;the Goddess Medusa and the Minotaur&mdash;invigorating his body with strength that exceeded a thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a primal roar, he launched a fist straight at Osborne, the force of his attack colliding head-on with Osborne's advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash unleashed a cataclysmic wave of energy that rocked both fighters, knocking them back several feet. The shockwave rippled out through the air, sending Armstrong staggering and wide-eyed, struggling to keep his footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are these monsters?!" Armstrong gasped, sheer terror painted across his face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
