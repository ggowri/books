  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Greyson and Roy sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were Class S powerhouses, but when it came to taking down the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, their effectiveness paled in comparison to Osborne's. Even combined, they wouldn't match his prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their strength was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them engaged a Class S assassin from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, effectively blocking their attempts to breach Osborne's Light Realm. Stripped of the advantage of Stealth Art, these Class S assassins found themselves on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, only one Class S assassin remained capable of attacking Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really think he could shatter it all on his own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wouldn't give him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After swiftly dispatching the Class AAA assassins, Osborne charged at the </span><span>third Class</span><span> S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassin with unbridled ferocity, unleashing a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent the assassin flying, his body howling in pain as bones cracked under the force, blood spewing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for a Class S warrior, such injuries were far from fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping the blood from his lips, the assassin stared at Osborne, shock etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're dead! How could you possibly detect our Stealth Art? Clearly, we've all underestimated your strength and the threat you pose to the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization! You killed Blood Princess, didn't you? And those two Class S assassins as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your fate is sealed! Sin and Crimson are on their way; you're finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In heaven or in hell, there's no one who can save you! You're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his mouth, Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sin and Crimson are really coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of the impending threat, Osborne sneered, saying, "Whether I die or not remains to be seen! But I do know this&mdash;you're about to find out just how deadly my punches can be! Let's see how long you can withstand my might!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's martial art aura exploded forth, a dark red energy enveloping his fists as he locked eyes with the Class S assassin, an aura of lethal intent radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will use your body to test my martial art aura!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class S assassin's expression hardened, a fierce determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had felt the weight of Osborne's strength before; a single punch had already wounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped any thoughts of offense, focusing entirely on defense, confident that he could endure long enough for Sin and Crimson to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can kill me? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how gifted you are, you're still just a Class AAA! Without a divine artifact, you won't even break through my defenses, let alone kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> his arms crossed defensively across his chest as he prepared for the incoming blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous impact, Osborne's fist connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's punch struck the assassin with the same force as before, but this time, it was cloaked in dark red martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassin's confidence was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, that confidence shattered, replaced by sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized too late that Osborne's attack was far more devastating than he had anticipated. His full-strength defense crumbled like paper beneath the overwhelming force of Osborne's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the reality of his impending doom sank in, the assassin could only brace himself for the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist was like a razor-sharp axe, slamming viciously into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A horrendous scream tore from his throat as Osborne instantly shattered his defenses. The full force of the blow landed squarely on his body, first pulverizing his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist punched through his chest, emerging from his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the martial art aura instantly shredded his internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne in shock, the vitality in his body rapidly fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Osborne, he had no Light of Redemption to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, he died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left in utter amazement, even forgetting to pull his arm out of the man's chest. He had anticipated breaking through the other's defenses but never imagined he would shatter his arms and pierce through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Martial art aura, what incredible defense-piercing ability!" Osborne exclaimed in </span><span>delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a true Class S powerhouse, not far behind Greyson in strength and certainly not a newly promoted Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had defended with all his might, yet Osborne had killed him with one punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, Osborne hadn't even transformed into a Vampire or unleashed the Breath of Celestial. This was just a normal punch with his regular strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result was truly astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, let's test out the defensive capabilities," Osborne muttered, turning his gaze to the other two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both staring at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had killed a fully defended Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin with one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them drew a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's gaze fell on them, their expressions instantly changed, filled with dread.</span></p><div class="pagination">
