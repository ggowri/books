  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression darkened as he heard Marlon's threatening voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ominous words were meant for him alone, a feat requiring immense mastery of power that few could achieve.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even most Class S Supreme Overlords wouldn't have the finesse to pull off something like that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just a short while ago, Osborne would never have been able to accomplish it himself; it was a skill he had only recently honed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's threat was twofold: to showcase his strength and to keep his actions hidden from prying eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had no intention of playing along.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Marlon's threat hit his ears, he remembered the past&mdash;how Marlon had brought Ebony to Rosmandi, nearly snatching Clarissa away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It struck Osborne that Marlon had wanted Clarissa!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a frosty glare, Osborne leveled his gaze at Marlon and said, "So you want me to go easy on your sister? You want me to avoid hurting her? Then you'd better say it loud and clear, no whispers in the shadows."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd, sparking intense murmurs and speculation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's face darkened in an instant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected Osborne to bring such a thing into the open.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're asking for death!" Marlon shot back, his tone icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "Oh, I think the one looking for death is you! If you hadn't threatened me, I might have just defeated your sister casually&mdash;maybe she'd just end up with a few bumps and bruises. With today's medical tech, she'd be back on her feet in no time. But now..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne paused, his gaze locking onto Ebony, his voice dripping with malice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she dares step into that arena, I'll make it my mission to humiliate her, leaving her regretting ever participating in my Honor Quest Ceremony."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's face drained of color, her cheeks flushing with a mix of fear and anger. She shot a frantic look at Marlon, her heart racing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Osborne's cold eyes, she saw his deadly seriousness and knew he was fully capable of carrying out his threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of humiliation at his hands was unbearable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon..." Ebony whispered, anxiety creeping into her voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's expression was thunderous as he unleashed a terrifying energy directed at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He bellowed, "You better not! Osborne, since you want me to say it publicly, let me warn you right here! If you so much as harm a single hair on my sister, I'll make you pay tenfold! I'll hunt you down and end you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A deadly glint ignited in Marlon's eyes, sending shivers through those watching.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was stunned, but then murmurs started to rise as they remembered Marlon's impressive background and power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was Marlon?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was ranked 40th on the Godson Rankings, a super prodigy with rumors swirling that he might even break into the top ten.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father, Rumen, was seated high above as the vice leader of the League of Divine Descent, ranked among the top fifty on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the most formidable figure in his lineage was his great-grandfather, Helios&mdash;the world's number one powerhouse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With such a prestigious background, Marlon felt invincible and had every right to threaten Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Osborne's jaw-dropping display of strength, few believed he could hold a candle to Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Murmurs fluttered through the audience.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's Osborne going to do now?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think? He'll back down! That's Marlon we're talking about. There's no way Osborne would risk angering him over his sister!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it'd be pure stupidity to cross Marlon like that!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne regarded the seething Marlon, unable to suppress a laugh.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He nodded with amusement. "Good, I'll remember that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then he turned to Ebony, waving her forward with an impatient gesture. "Come on up to the stage; don't keep everyone waiting."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony thought Osborne had caved under the threat from his brother. Her initial panic vanished, replaced by a haughty arrogance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sneered, saying, "So, you're not completely brainless after all! Only a fool would go up against my brother. Weren't you just brimming with bravado before? Now look at you, cowering in front of him. And let's not forget Clarissa..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she stepped onto the stage, her words were cut short.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne moved in an instant. Before Ebony could react, he was right in front of her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grabbing her by the neck, he lifted her off the ground, leaving her dangling in mid-air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish, Osborne slapped her hard across the face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a brutal hit, more forceful than any before. Her once-pretty face swelled up immediately, and blood mixed with shattered teeth sprayed out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't stop there. He alternated between slapping her from side to side, each hit landing with a thunderous smack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony was soon dazed, her face a grotesque mess of blood and bruises. Her mouth, ears, and nose bled profusely, making her look hideously deformed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne discarded her like trash, tossing her to the ground. He planted a boot on her face, pressing down hard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning his icy gaze to Marlon, he declared, "I've humiliated her. What are you going to do about it?"</p><div class="pagination">
