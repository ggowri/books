  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make another big score? Who are we going to rob this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's eyes lit up. He had complete trust in Osborne now. After all, they had robbed Davy, and he had earned 200 million dollars. Where else could he find such a good opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even ancient families couldn't earn 200 million in a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Austin couldn't help but be tempted. The Montague family was known to have tens of billions in assets, but most of it was fixed assets. Watching Osborne earn over 400 million and Barlyn earn 200 million, she was tempted too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just robbing the gang's illegal money, so she had no psychological burden at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can participate too. Just give me a 20% share. You tell us who to rob, and we'll go for it. I'll even take care of the money laundering later," Austin quickly offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn rolled his eyes. "Austin, you have so much allowance, yet you still want to compete with me? Don't you have enough money? How can you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin rolled her eyes back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by competing with you? It was Osborne who said he wanted me to join! Besides, I inherited the Montague family at birth, so there's no sense of achievement in earning money. Now I want to earn some money myself. Is that a problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne interrupted them, smiling, "Alright, stop arguing. This time, we're not going to rob, we're going to pick up money! You'll each get a 30% share."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick up money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Austin's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand robbing, but picking up money... where can we pick up money? The bank vault?" Barlyn asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled mysteriously, "You'll see when we get there. If we're lucky, this time's haul won't be less than before, and it might even be more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Austin were immediately excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn thought, "We robbed 750 million before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's more than that... doesn't that mean it could be a billion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face turned red with excitement. She asked, "Osborne, is that true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's true, from now on, Osborne, you're my real brother, Austin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "I'll remember that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you need to disguise yourself so that people can't recognize you easily and expose your identity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm good at this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin started putting on makeup, while Barlyn, who was visiting Mayby City for the first time, didn't need to disguise himself as he wasn't worried about being recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the three of them set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination was the Ashford family's diamond dealing market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye's X-ray vision, the uncut diamonds in the Ashford family's diamond dealing market were like visible treasures waiting for him to pick them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought Barlyn and Austin to foster good relationships with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their identities were worth investing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A diamond dealing market?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Austin were stunned when they realized Osborne had brought them to a diamond dealing market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's money to be picked up here?" They looked at Osborne with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that diamond gambling was just like any other gambling, where most people lost. Most people who came to the diamond dealing market were not picking up money but giving it to the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "It's true that we're picking up money because I have a special ability to roughly sense if there are high-quality diamonds in the uncut diamonds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't reveal that he could directly see the diamonds inside the uncut ones, hiding most of his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the two were still stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had such an ability, it was like cheating. The diamond dealing market really was a place to pick up money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are we waiting for? Let's start picking money up! Tell us what to do, and we'll follow your lead," Austin said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, being a woman, had a weakness for top-tier diamonds, but she wasn't extravagant and didn't like to splurge on expensive jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if it were a top-tier diamond she had cut herself, that was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Let's go inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started walking toward the entrance of the diamond dealing market with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he reached the door, a group of security guards from the diamond dealing market blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were stern and unfriendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards said, his voice dripping with menace, "Stop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, is it? You better turn around and leave. Our young master said you're on the blacklist - no entry allowed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His last visit had involved selecting seven uncut diamonds, cutting them open, and turning them into top-tier diamonds worth over a billion. This not only infuriated Wesley to the point of almost passing out but also won him an uncut diamond mine worth hundreds of millions from the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise that Wesley had blacklisted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't about to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Austin and said, "Austin, it looks like making money might be a challenge. These Ashford family guards don't seem to want me in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed up to Osborne, standing in front of him, and then slapped one of the guards hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snapped, "You lowlifes think you can keep Osborne out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Wesley himself were here, he'd better treat me with respect and roll out the red carpet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now get out of my way!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
