  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know that East Zone Nine is named after the Ninth Divine Peak! At that peak alone, at least three Deity King warriors have perished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there have been over a hundred Deity Overlord warriors who met their end there! The number of Celestial and Transcendent Deities who have died is even greater! Just recently, there was another battle at the Ninth Divine Peak, and the Wild Flame Army sent in 100 thousand elite troops to assist... I can only wonder how many lives will be lost this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression was heavy with concern, and Osborne was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three Deity Kings dead? Over a hundred Deity Overlords? What kind of terrifying force could kill Deity Kings?" Osborne was in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else could it be? It's the Deathborn army! And not just the mindless ones you might be thinking of, but the truly intelligent Deathborn," Hannah replied, her face grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deathborn army?" Osborne was taken aback. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah took a deep breath, her tone shifting to a more serious narrative. "This goes back over a thousand years. Back then, Celestara didn't have any divine peaks. It was only after Lord Malevolence fought against the seven pinnacle Deity Kings of the Human Community that the land was torn apart, reshaping the landscape and giving rise to forty-two massive peaks that pierced the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These peaks are distributed evenly across the east, west, south, and north, with only two in the central region, but they are much larger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initially, no one paid much attention to these towering mountains; they were just taller than the surrounding landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But five hundred years ago, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A mysterious, powerful force began to protect these peaks, making the rock nearly indestructible. Even a Deity King warrior would struggle to break off a small piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's when the Deathborn began to emerge! All the Deathborn in Celestara today originated from those forty-two peaks, and they quickly spread to every corner of the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over the centuries, they have only grown stronger, posing a renewed threat to the Human Community, which had only just begun to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most concerning part is that the Deathborn managed to locate the sealed Lord Malevolence. They spent centuries breaking his seal, and eventually, they succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Lord Malevolence's return, the balance in Celestara shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm getting ahead of myself; let's return to the divine peaks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brushed a stray hair behind her ear and pressed on. "When people realized that the Deathborn were emerging from those forty-two peaks, they began organizing warriors to cleanse the area, to wipe out the Deathborn once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But every attempt failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it was the Human Community's efforts or the joint campaigns led by Lord Malevolence and the various races, they all ended in disaster. They faced fierce resistance from the Deathborn army on those peaks, and even Lord Malevolence was injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that among the seven pinnacle Deity Kings who fought alongside him, only two remain&mdash;God of Light and God of Night. God of Night was severely wounded in the conflict and hasn't been seen in decades."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted dramatically at this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night is injured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of her words settled heavily on him. The Human Community's pillars of strength were the God of Light and God of Night, both survivors of the cataclysmic battle a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he learned that the God of Night had been gravely hurt and hadn't shown himself in years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night... he was Isa's mentor!" Osborne's brow furrowed deeply; concern etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah continued, "The operation to eradicate the Deathborn ultimately failed for both the Human Community forces led by God of Light and God of Night, and the Dark Deity Legion under Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it wasn't a complete loss... It was then that they discovered the existence of Ultimate Essence Crystals and even Celestial Crystals within the divine peaks! Practitioners with earth elemental power could slowly excavate tunnels on these peaks, securing these precious resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite frequent attacks from the Deathborn forces and the tragic deaths of Deity Overlord and even Deity King warriors in their ambushes, the major factions nevertheless kept sending warriors to exploit these divine peaks...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because these peaks not only contained Ultimate Essence Crystals and Celestial Crystals but also even more valuable treasures&mdash;technology!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Ultimate Malevolence Airship, as well as the more powerful Supreme Malevolence Airship, were obtained through the technology mined from these divine peaks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened at this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Technology?" he echoed, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><div class="pagination">
