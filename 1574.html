  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the powerful dark energy swirling around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His complexion darkened considerably. "You're actually a practitioner of elemental power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of tension washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the various clans in Celestara, practitioners who focused on elemental power were quite rare. This was largely because enhancing divine power was significantly easier than developing elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most individuals, once they became Junior Deities, shifted their focus to boosting their divine power, often neglecting elemental power or treating it as a secondary pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a handful of practitioners ever managed to elevate their elemental power to high levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everyone knew that the most elite warriors were typically those who had focused on elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just look at Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or the seven top Deity Kings from the Human Community who once besieged him&mdash;God of Night, God of Light, God of Space, God of Time, God of Death, Goddess of Life, and Goddess of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them had honed a specific elemental power to its absolute peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength far surpassed that of ordinary Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, the number of individuals who truly excelled in elemental power remained low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a tough road&mdash;much harder than advancing divine power. For most people lacking exceptional talent, focusing on elemental power at the expense of divine power was a losing game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne's Thunder Power had already left Guy astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought he could withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, seeing Osborne reveal his dark power, which was even stronger than Thunder Power, Guy felt a clear sense of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization left him shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How much power are you really hiding? Your dark power is incredibly strong! If you're allowed to grow, you could become a massive threat to all our clans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, a murderous intent flickered in Guy's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly. "You'll never know how much I'm hiding because I don't need to go all out to deal with you! Right now, I can take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne unleashed a wave of dark energy that shot straight toward Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's expression hardened in an instant as he threw a punch to intercept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dark energy shattered, but Guy was pushed back a couple of steps, his face darkening with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's demeanor turned icy. "Arrogant! "I admit you're strong now, but do you really think you can defeat me that easily? You're underestimating me! I'll show you just how powerful I really am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Guy charged at Osborne with terrifying speed, a whirlwind of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Let's see what you've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fired off another blast of dark energy, which spiraled toward Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" Guy roared, unleashing a surge of divine power that nearly doubled his earlier strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was clear he was now going all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's casually thrown dark energy was effortlessly shattered before Guy, who closed the distance in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A glimmer of triumph flashed in his eyes as he threw a powerful punch aimed right at Osborne's chest. "Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "You've got some skill, but it's not that impressive! If I were using only Thunder Power, it might be a challenge to beat you. But too bad for you, I'm using dark power now! Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, a torrent of dark energy erupted around him, enveloping his fist. Then, with a mighty swing, Osborne unleashed a punch that radiated sheer force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clash of their attacks created a deafening sound, shaking the entire cavern to its core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rocks crumbled and fell from above, shattered into gravel by the turbulence generated by their battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the divine power barrier surrounding them trembled violently, on the verge of giving way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the midst of this chaos, a figure was sent hurtling backward, blood pouring from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He crashed into the stone wall of the cave, leaving behind a massive dent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That figure was Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained planted in place like an immovable mountain, while Guy had been blown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that brief instant, Guy felt the sharp snap of his arm as Osborne's powerful fist, wreathed in dark energy, struck him squarely in the chest, caving it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that single blow, Guy was defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his status as a Deity Overlord, he was still only at the early stage, and in the face of a serious Osborne, his strength was simply inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smirk as he appeared before Guy in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy spat out another mouthful of blood, his face a mask of shock and fear as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's dark power was overwhelming. One punch had shattered Guy's defenses, crushed his Malevolence Amulet, and left his Divine Body severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... what do you want?" Guy managed to stammer, regret and terror etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne offered a calm smile. "Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you. Instead, I'll transform you into one of my Blood Clan descendants and make you my loyal subordinate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
