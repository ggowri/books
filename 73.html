  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone present could not help but be stunned when they saw the situation in the cutting machine. They were shocked, greedy, and jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Alison was completely stunned at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had already cut out top-quality diamonds worth three hundred million dollars. Alison felt that she could bear the result, but she was still stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The core area inside was filled with flawless glass-type diamonds. The weight was probably more than 22 pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison suddenly looked at Osborne. She threw herself into Osborne&rsquo;s arms and hugged Osborne&rsquo;s neck tightly. Alison shouted excitedly, &ldquo;Osborne, we&rsquo;re rich! Luna Jewelry are going to be the largest jewelry company in Mayby City.&rdquo; This capable woman was as happy as a child at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne coughed. Alison let go of him with a blush. She didn&rsquo;t dare to look into Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It at least worth one billion dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is still the most conservative estimate. It may even exceed two billion dollars. If it is designed by a top designer and meets the right buyer&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Even more expensive!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The value of this piece of diamond is more than the total assets of several wealthy families!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What kind of luck is this?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was utterly stunned by the crowd&rsquo;s exclamations. He looked at the cut diamond and felt dizzy. He was unable to stand steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is impossible. The Ashford family&rsquo;s experts have studied this uncut diamond. It is definitely a waste. How could it have a billion-level top-grade diamond? No. Impossible!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s cheeks turned red. His eyes were bloodshot. He stared at Osborne fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;This only shows that the Ashford family is a bunch of rubbish. You can&rsquo;t distinguish between trash and treasures. I want to thank you, for not only giving us top-grade diamonds worth more than one billion dollars, but also giving us an entire diamond mine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked at Wesley with a mocking and contemptuous expression. &ldquo;Wesley, thank you very much. You helped Luna Jewelry a lot. Now it is much easier for Luna Jewelry to suppress the Caldwell Group.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Wesley was so angry that he vomited blood. He fell backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was already midnight when Osborne and Alison left the diamond dealing market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, how about transferring half of the company&rsquo;s security personnel to protect you from now on?&rdquo; Alison suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head. &ldquo;No need. No one knows that I am the boss of Luna Jewelry. You should be careful next time. I am worried that someone will be greedy. Wesley might also do something desperate.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What happened in the diamond dealing market tonight would soon spread throughout Mayby City. The top-quality diamonds worth more than one billion dollars were worth the risk for many people. Wesley was so angry that he vomited blood and fainted. He was also likely to take revenge. Even the Caldwell family probably wouldn&rsquo;t allow Luna Jewelry grow stronger. Alison might be in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Alison didn&rsquo;t care at all. She said calmly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Nothing will happen to me. If they use normal business methods, I might still be worried. But if they want to do something dirty, I will make them die without knowing how.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned when he heard this. He did not understand why Alison was so confident. But he soon figured it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna Jewelry was once the Godfather&rsquo;s property. To take advantage of the Godfather&rsquo;s property was really looking for death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, Osborne picked out a Land Rover off-road vehicle from Alison&rsquo;s fleet and drove back alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the trunk of the car, there was a piece of uncut diamond with a strange shape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Among the uncut diamond, there was the top-quality diamond that Osborne needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was not glass type, but Imperial Green.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was very excited. He sped up the car and returned to the Institute of Human Research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After moving the uncut diamond back to the room, Osborne began cutting it. He didn&rsquo;t have a cutting machine. So, he could only use an alloy dagger to peel off the diamond skin bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was very strong. It only took him half an hour to peel off all the diamond skin. It revealed an Imperial Green diamond. The size was like a volleyball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brilliant green filled the entire room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">More than twenty pounds of top-grade Imperial Green diamond was worth at least tens of billions of dollars, or even hundreds of billions of dollars. But Osborne wanted to use it to enhance his supernatural power, Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he used this to enhance Satan&rsquo;s Eye, the Imperial Green diamond would be ruined. If he used it to exchange for money, it would be enough for him to live a luxurious life for ten lifetimes in Mayby City. Would someone else be willing to use something worth tens of billions to increase the strength of his supernatural powers? In fact, Satan&rsquo;s Eye could be improved by using cheaper types of diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was hesitant. But in the end, he made up his mind.</p><div class="pagination">
