  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caesar was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's realization hit him like a thunderbolt, igniting a fury within him that he could barely contain. As a protector sent by the Eldridge family, he had failed in his duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caesar was one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a prodigy with an unlimited future, and now he lay lifeless under Hubery's watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept this failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vengeance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was imperative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to avenge Caesar. Every single one of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings must pay for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his heart racing, Hubery charged toward the arena. As a peak Deity King, his speed was astonishing, and in the blink of an eye, he entered the Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no fear stepping into this dark dimension; his power far surpassed Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's Eclipse Realm affected his senses, it wouldn't leave him lost or blind to his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, Hubery quickly sensed the presence of Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you all!" he roared, his voice echoing in the darkness as he surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and Hannah were focused on healing Bryce, desperately trying to expel the dark energy that had taken root in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't afford to divert their attention, not even for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they stopped, the dark energy belonging to Lord Malevolence would surge back, sealing Bryce's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him! Buy me one minute!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one minute, and I can drive out the dark power and heal Bryce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we can leave here!" Osborne shouted urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it! We'll hold him off!" Anastasia replied, her face etched with determination as she stepped forward to confront Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her stood Zoe, Kendra, Mila, and Diana, and each of them felt a twinge of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were about to face a foe more powerful than Caesar&mdash;a peak Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan. The gap in their realms was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anastasia, the strongest among them, had only just reached the mid-stage of Deity King, putting her two levels below Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of difference was not something talent could bridge. Doubt gnawed at her, but she had to step up and buy Osborne the time he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Anastasia shouted, unleashing her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder crackled at her command, hurling toward Hubery with ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Kendra, Mila, and Diana followed suit, each unleashing their own devastating attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe attacked with her soul power, with Kendra engulfing the area in flames, Mila summoning blinding holy light, and Diana wielding the earth's elemental force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they unleashed everything they had at Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, momentarily disoriented by the Eclipse Realm, only realized the danger as their attacks closed in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of fear, a cold smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, you're actually attacking me instead of fleeing? You're asking for it! I acknowledge your strength; you're among the best of the younger generation. It's been ages since the Human Community produced talents like you. But the gap between us is beyond your imagination! Now, stand back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling resolve, Hubery unleashed a powerful punch, sending a shockwave of energy that effortlessly shattered Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, and the others' combined efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" they shouted, their faces pale as they realized the sheer force of his attack was headed straight for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in as they scrambled to defend themselves, knowing that the stakes were higher than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Hubery's attack landed, the impact was devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force sent the young warriors flying, and even though they were shielded by the Supreme Malevolence Shield, they couldn't help but turn pale from the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Zoe, clad in her Supreme Sovereign's Armor, emerged unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Kendra, Mila, and Diana, however, all tasted blood as it trickled from the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, their Divine Bodies were strong enough&mdash;each at least at Level Eight&mdash;so the injuries were manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, a grim seriousness settled over their faces. Hubery was too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia wiped the blood from her lip, her expression steely. "Truly, a peak Deity King is a force to be reckoned with. In Celestara, peak Deity Kings sit at the top of the pyramid! Aside from the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, Lord Malevolence, and his Nine Dark Sovereigns, they are virtually invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between us and him is massive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter how big that gap is, we have to hold for one minute! If we don't, Bryce will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anastasia surged forward once more, determination radiating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, noticing that his previous attack hadn't seriously wounded the group, narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially at the sight of Zoe's Supreme Sovereign's Armor, anger coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caesar was truly dead, and now the armor had fallen into the hands of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze burned with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death! I'll see to it that you pay dearly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, prepare to join Caesar in death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to end this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
