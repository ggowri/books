But fourteen? I could slap myself for getting into this mess just because I was attracted to someone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if I survive this, you have to help me unlock Satan's Eye! Or this won't be worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Emma began her attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Psychic Blast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death's Stare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma didn't hesitate. She unleashed all her power and trump cards in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying cold aura spread over hundreds of yards, covering everything in thick ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourteen Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were strong enough to shatter the ice layer instantly, glaring at Emma like she was a mere insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Emma to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All fourteen Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> moved, but Emma's Psychic Blast hit their minds just then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, these Evolved Humans weren't affected by Psychic Blasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed unaffected and kept charging at Emma, causing her expression to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, her right eye's Death's Stare was activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying and eerie white light shot out from Emma's right eye, instantly hitting the two Werewolves in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Awooo</span><span>!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aaaah</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Piercing howls filled the air as the two Werewolves suddenly stopped. They rolled on </span><span>the ground in agony. The blood streamed from their eyes, noses, mouths, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The life force quickly drained from their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stunned the remaining twelve Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, who all halted, too afraid to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them had died in an instant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Emma, seeing that her face was deathly pale from the enormous energy drain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Evolved Humans exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid! That was her trump card! She can't use it again. If we attack together, we can easily tear her apart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa said this, then unleashed a trump card of her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashes of Death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma immediately sensed something wrong. She barely managed to raise the swallow shield in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crackle, crackle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Medusa's attack was blocked by the swallow shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her expression change drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom, boom, boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eleven Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attacked Emma again. They had guessed correctly. Emma couldn't use Death's Stare again so soon and had to rely on the swallow shield for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom, boom, boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the barrage of attacks hit, even the swallow shield began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the swallow shield was a divine artifact, Emma, as a Class AA, couldn't fully wield its power. Against the combined attacks of over a dozen Class AAA Evolved Humans, even the shield was struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy absorbed by the swallow shield surged into Emma's body, making her cheeks flush red as she felt like she was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no choice but to keep attacking, trying to release the overwhelming energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with several Titans blocking her, her attacks couldn't inflict any fatal damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Emma became a punching bag for the dozen or so Class AAA Evolved Humans surrounding her. Fortunately, the swallow shield was strong enough, or she would have died multiple times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the swallow shield absorbed most of the attacks, Emma still had to endure the intense shockwaves. Blood quickly trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma couldn't help but curse again, her eyes turning bloodshot. She didn't have time to regret her decisions. She felt like a small boat caught in a storm, on the brink of capsizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all she could do was grit her teeth and hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only hope that Osborne would defeat his opponents quickly and come to her rescue. Otherwise, she would surely die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was repeatedly knocked back. The power of the swallow shield seemed to be weakening under the relentless onslaught, and Emma's injuries were worsening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept coughing up blood, her face growing paler by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I about to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma </span><span>muttered,</span><span> her mind suddenly flooded with memories of her past twenty-odd years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a young age, she had always been the most talented in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had awakened three extra </span><span>energy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone believed she was exceptional, and she thought so too. She even believed that no man was worthy of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she was about to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's vision began to blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hold on any longer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
