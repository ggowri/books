  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened as the reality of the situation hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King had not simply been sitting idle. He had secretly summoned his army, which was now racing toward the battlefield at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least a hundred peak Deity Overlords were charging forward, and just behind them were even more&mdash;mid-stage and late-stage Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, a staggering 30 thousand Deathborn soldiers were on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they managed to regroup with Deathborn King, Osborne and Angelo wouldn't just be unable to kill him. Perhaps their very survival would be in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to hesitate any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their best chance&mdash;Deathborn King was severely injured. If they could finish him off now, he could obtain the death scent liquid, and Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would fully restore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't let this opportunity slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne missed this chance, taking down a Deathborn King protected by his army would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne launched himself into the fray once more, joining Angelo in a frenzied assault on Deathborn King, hoping to eliminate him before the army arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Osborne truly felt Deathborn King's terrifying vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the severe injuries he had sustained and the relentless attacks from both Osborne and Angelo, the King's life force remained stubbornly resilient. With their power levels so closely matched, finishing him off proved to be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the Deathborn army arrived in full force, a wave of peak Deity Overlord surging toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Angelo exchanged glances, both realizing the dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said urgently, "Angelo, your attacks can't deal the fatal blow to Deathborn King. You need to hold off the Deathborn army and buy me some time. I'll take care of the King. If we don't finish him off, none of us will make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Angelo nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks could only inflict wounds that the King would quickly heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's dark power was pure and formidable, capable of inflicting damage that Deathborn King's Divine Body struggled to recover from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Mr. Bowman, I'm counting on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angelo charged at the approaching the Deathborn army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edison, you and everyone else, join me in holding off the Deathborn army! If we can just hold on until Mr. Bowman takes down Deathborn King, we'll win this!" Angelo shouted, rallying his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and the others wasted no time, rushing to fight alongside Angelo against the oncoming horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King laughed triumphantly, and his excitement was palpable as he saw his army finally arrive. His gaze turned to Osborne, filled with malice and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with menace. "You're not even a full Deity King yet, and you managed to wound me like this. What a genius you are! But it's too bad you couldn't finish me off. Now, you're all done for! I'll offer your flesh and blood as a sacrifice to my lord; he'll be thrilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Deathborn King's eyes were all hideous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't kill me. Sure, you've got Deity King-level power, maybe even stronger than most, but you have no idea how resilient a Deity King's life force is. You're just not capable of taking me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, unfazed. "Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The life force of a Deity King is indeed impressive. But do you really think I can't kill you? No matter how strong your vitality is, it will eventually run dry. Let's see just how long you can hold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had taken a moment to catch his breath, finally ready to unleash Abyssal Spear once more. He first enveloped Deathborn King in an eternal darkness, stripping him of all perception. The King sensed the danger looming, but despite his frantic dodging in the darkness, he could not escape the lethal strike of the Abyssal Spear, which was as swift as a flash of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abyssal Spear pierced the Deathborn King's body again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wretched scream erupted, echoing through the air as Deathborn King's already severe injuries worsened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he found himself unable to shatter Osborne's Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's determination surged. The Deathborn army was closing in rapidly. Even with Angelo holding them back, it wouldn't be for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to eliminate Deathborn King, and he had to do it fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Undead Cataclysm! Come out! All of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eternity shrouding the battlefield, Osborne was confident his spatial power would remain hidden from Angelo. Without hesitation, he unleashed the full extent of his power. In an instant, one thousand Dark Undeads materialized, with eight clones accompanying them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the very fabric of space around Deathborn King began to fracture and collapse, a terrifying force ripping at his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne plunged into Eternity, wielding the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged alongside his eight spatial clones and a thousand Dark Undeads, launching a ferocious assault on Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how resilient Deathborn King's life force was, he simply couldn't withstand such overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that decisive moment, Deathborn King fell&mdash;dead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
