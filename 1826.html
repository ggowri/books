  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, you and your little crew will die here!" Orlando sneered, his contempt evident as he looked at Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando had always assumed that Darren was the leader of this group, especially since he was the deputy leader of the Pioneers of Starlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't seen the actual leader among them, and the likes of Osborne and Anastasia seemed far too young for such a role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the attacks from the dozen Deity King warriors, neither Darren nor Osborne showed any signs of fear or panic, as if they were completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were just dealing with a handful of early-stage Deity Kings and one mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a barrage of attacks descended upon them, a gentle ripple of spatial energy erupted from Osborne, enveloping everyone in a translucent spatial shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the incoming attacks crashed against the shield, disintegrating into nothingness, while the shield remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's expression hardened dramatically, shock washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coolly, "Let's end this. There's no point in wasting time with them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're not willing to leave the base, we'll just take it by force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Bryce, the battle enthusiast, was practically bouncing with excitement. He laughed heartily. "You all stay back! Let me handle them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already sparred with the various talents under Lord Malevolence, but I haven't had a chance to test myself against the Human Community warriors from Celestara yet! They may be a bit weaker, but they'll be perfect for a warm-up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bryce charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Radiant Era Syndicate, huh? You dare to occupy someone else's base and act so arrogantly? Time to take a nap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of power radiated from Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his time in Hope Haven, he had been training relentlessly, determined not to be the weakest among the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. For over two hundred days, he pushed himself hard, and now his strength had grown significantly since the arena battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reached mid-stage Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just him&mdash;Zoe, Mila, Kendra, and Hannah had also reached mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Diana remained at the peak of early-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's power now far surpassed what it had been before. Although Orlando was also a mid-stage Deity King, he and Bryce were not even in the same league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cultivation level might be the same, but the differences in their Divine Body levels and elemental essences were vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the other ten or so early-stage Deity King members of the Radiant Era Syndicate? They appeared utterly weak in comparison, completely outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome was sealed the moment Bryce made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With effortless precision, he struck. The early-stage Deity King warriors of the Radiant Era Syndicate couldn't hold up against him. Even when they tried to band together, Bryce shattered their defenses with ease, leaving them injured and sprawled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a heartbeat, the dozen or so Deity King warriors from the Radiant Era Syndicate were left battered and bruised. The only one still standing was Orlando, who stared in disbelief at Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando stammered, his voice laced with panic as he stumbled backward, fear etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce chuckled. "Trying to run? Not a chance! Get on the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming surge of water elemental power crashed down upon Orlando.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fought desperately to resist and struggle, but it was futile. A moment later, he let out a strangled cry, dropping to his knees, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt as if a divine peak rested upon him, rendering him utterly immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in sheer terror, "Stop! Who are you really? You aren't even from the Pioneers of Starlight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Pioneers of Starlight have someone as powerful as you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who I'm connected to? I'm part of the Baxter family! I work for the Baxter family! They're a Dukedom Level Power, one of the rulers of Apocalypse City! If you dare touch me, the Baxter family won't let you off the hook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, you'll all be dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apocalypse City may be vast, but there's no refuge for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this revelation, Bryce hesitated, halting his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, his expression shifting to one of interest. "Did I hear that right? The Baxter family, one of the ten major families of the West Zone? A Dukedom Level Power? Are you saying the Radiant Era Syndicate works for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of misguided triumph, Orlando replied, "Yes! The Pioneers of Starlight are backed by the Baxter family! You can't oppose them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you're a hundred times stronger, you're still just an ant compared to the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially in Apocalypse City, the Baxter family is the strongest force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have any sense, you'll let me go, apologize, and offer compensation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you're all finished!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
