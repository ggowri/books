  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet nodded at Osborne, then turned to Paul and said, &ldquo;Captain Paul, stop. We&rsquo;re all on the same side; there&rsquo;s no need for this to escalate.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sharon also added calmly, &ldquo;This is a critical time. Ms. Radcliffe has been repeatedly attacked by assassins and needs more strong people around to protect her. Infighting now disregards Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, Harris said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all disperse.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s face turned extremely grim. &ldquo;What if I say no? This piece of trash has provoked me several times. Am I supposed to endure it and do nothing? How will I maintain my authority as the captain of the Bodyguard Unit?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three of them frowned, feeling the situation was tricky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you apologize to Captain Paul?&rdquo; Violet suggested to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled and shook his head directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you for your suggestion, Deputy Captain Harris, but I refuse. I did nothing wrong, so why should I apologize?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet was stunned and suddenly felt a headache coming on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a temporary retreat. After all, he is the captain. Besides, if you really fight, you can&rsquo;t beat him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sharon also nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Captain Paul is very strong. Even if the three of us combined our strength, we might not be able to defeat him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just let it go. There&rsquo;s no need for such a direct confrontation. He is the captain. If you insist on not backing down, the three of us can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed and still shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you for your help, but I still refuse. As for Paul, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve my apology.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three of them were taken aback by Osborne&rsquo;s response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul, seeing this, laughed coldly. &ldquo;Harris, Violet, Sharon, you all saw it, right? It&rsquo;s this kid who&rsquo;s too arrogant. He&rsquo;s asking for death. If I don&rsquo;t teach him a lesson, how can I still be the captain?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Paul glared coldly at Osborne. &ldquo;Trash, if you&rsquo;re a man, step out and face me one-on-one. Let&rsquo;s see how I kill you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne responded coldly, &ldquo;You want to kill me? I&rsquo;m afraid it will be you who dies.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne holstered his gun, ready for a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his view, this was a good opportunity. If he could defeat Paul in a one-on-one duel in front of so many people, it would certainly help him replace Paul and become the new captain of the Bodyguard Unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two stood face-to-face, the tension between them palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed as though a fierce battle could erupt at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But just then, a group of people appeared in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leading the group was the true manager of the Radcliffe family, Donna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Behind Donna was Clarissa, heavily protected by bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked at the tense standoff between Osborne and Paul, a trace of surprise in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Ms. Donna, Paul quickly restrained his anger and respectfully said, &ldquo;Ms. Donna, just now, the third perimeter security team reported a suspected metahuman enemy intrusion. I was leading an investigation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Really? Did you catch the intruder?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression turned cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Recently, Clarissa had been repeatedly attacked by assassins. Any hint of danger made Donna extremely vigilant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Not yet, but I suspect he&rsquo;s behind it all.&rdquo; Paul pointed at Osborne with a cold smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was surprised and turned to look at Osborne, frowning. &ldquo;Hmm? Why are you wearing a security guard&rsquo;s uniform? Are you a security guard now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s face immediately darkened. &ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul noticed Donna&rsquo;s anger and quickly explained, &ldquo;Ms. Donna, I arranged for him to be a security guard. I believe his background is suspicious, and his intentions in coming to the Radcliffe family are questionable. So, until we fully investigate, it&rsquo;s better to keep him in the security team.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he glared at Osborne, eyes full of threats, as if warning him not to speak out of turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, however, ignored Paul&rsquo;s threats and sneered. &ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s not retaliation because I suspected you of being a traitor yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo; Paul was instantly furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna snorted coldly, already understanding the situation. She glared at Paul and said, &ldquo;Captain Paul, with Osborne&rsquo;s strength, it&rsquo;s not suitable for him to be a security guard. Even if you doubt his identity and intentions, it would be more appropriate to have him as an inner circle bodyguard.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was displeased but nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, I didn&rsquo;t consider this carefully. I&rsquo;ll immediately adjust his role to an inner circle bodyguard.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nodded and then turned to Osborne. &ldquo;Osborne, what&rsquo;s the situation here? Explain in detail.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Nothing much. We were just messing around, having a little sparring.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Donna&rsquo;s appearance, there was no way Osborne and Paul would fight. Osborne wasn&rsquo;t interested in reporting Paul to Donna because it wouldn&rsquo;t help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He already knew yesterday that the Radcliffe family had special trust in Paul. Even if Donna knew Paul was at fault, she wouldn&rsquo;t punish him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul glared coldly at Osborne but said nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes, we were just sparring. It&rsquo;s all a misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
