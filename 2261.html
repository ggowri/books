  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group matches continued to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the second day, Osborne was scheduled to fight early, facing Earl from a Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to form, he didn't waste any time&mdash;he drew his bow, loosed an arrow, and swiftly defeated his opponent before heading back to the competitors' lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, fellow Mystic Sirius Sect disciples Jamar and Bethan, both seed players, had a smooth ride in their own group. They easily dispatched their opponents, securing their spots in the next round without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the same couldn't be said for the other Mystic Sirius Sect participants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many found themselves up against equally matched opponents, and some unfortunate souls were even placed in groups with other seed players, leading to quick eliminations and a bleak path to advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the third day of group matches began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's next opponent was Quincy from Azure Haven Academy, a man with cold, piercing eyes. Quincy had bested Lavoy from Fantasia Isle the previous day and was riding high with two victories under his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their upcoming duel would determine who would advance from their group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy glared at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> his expression icy. "Look, I know I might not stand a chance against you, but don't think you can take me down easily! I heard you bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on yourself to win the whole thing? Hilarious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, his voice dripping with disdain, "You'll never beat Leroy! She's the pride of Azure Haven Academy, and she'll wipe the floor with you, showing you just how big the gap really is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't even need Leroy to take you down; Marreese and Pero could handle you with ease! You think you can make it to the top five? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect is washed up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Quincy crossed his arms, a smug look plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained </span><span>unfazed,</span><span> his calm demeanor unbroken. "Is that all you've got? If you're done talking, why don't you head to the sidelines? You seem to enjoy critiquing others&mdash;maybe you should stick to that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne drew back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow coalesced, radiating a terrifying force that locked onto Quincy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy's determination hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't take me down that easily!" he shouted, swinging his massive battle blade in front of him like a makeshift shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade was enormous, resembling a door more than a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since defensive divine artifacts were prohibited in the city duel, Quincy had cleverly chosen this massive blade, hoping to exploit the rules and use it for defense at a critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed this would give him a fighting chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Quincy, he underestimated Osborne's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Quincy brandished his "shield," Osborne smirked, the arrow on his bow glowing brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot forth, disappearing in an instant, only to reappear right in front of Quincy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was lightning fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why no one had managed to evade Osborne's arrows so far&mdash;his Sacred Power was a fusion of spatial and dark energy, allowing the arrow to fly with the speed of teleportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the Empyrean Sacredness, dodging Osborne's attack was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy realized this too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his divine power, channeling it into his blade in a desperate attempt to block the incoming arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena erupted with a deafening blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, everyone watched in horror as Quincy screamed, the massive blade was sent flying, and he was thrown off the platform, unconscious from the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne wins!" the referee announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's victory was marked by yet another arrow fired with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One arrow! Another victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Quincy tried to get around the rules by using his massive battle blade as a shield, he still couldn't hold up against Osborne's non-stop onslaught and was quickly taken down by a single arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marreese and Tyson, watching from the sidelines, exchanged grave looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that was some serious firepower on display!" Marreese exclaimed, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure, a formidable opponent! Guess Mystic Sirius Sect isn't as washed-up as people say! But if you </span><span>wanna</span><span> make it into the top five, you'll have to get past us first!" Tyson chimed in, his competitive juices flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, didn't give them a second glance. He simply turned around and walked away, leaving them to chew over their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the third day of the group matches came to an end, and the top sixteen players were decided. It was no shocker that all nine seeded players had sailed through without a hiccup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the remaining seven contenders, four were from Azure Haven Academy, two from Fantasia Isle, and one from a Third-rate Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, the sixteen finalists consisted of seven from Azure Haven Academy, five from Fantasia Isle, three from Mystic Sirius Sect, and one from the Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Azure Haven Academy was still in top-notch form, and Fantasia Isle had lived up to expectations. In contrast, Mystic Sirius Sect was lingering at the bottom of the rankings, a glaring sign of its decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Angela and Danilo, look a bit on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela tried to convince herself, "It's only the group stage. Maybe there'll be some game-changers in the round of sixteen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought of Osborne, a glimmer of hope ignited within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Mystic Sirius Sect had the smallest contingent among the Second-rate Powers, if Osborne could snatch the championship, no one would dare to write off the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the title of champion was the ultimate bragging right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Game-changers?" Danilo shook his head and let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't as starry-eyed as Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just praying those three can make it into the top ten. In the last city duel, we had three in the top ten. I'd be gutted if we do worse this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela kept her silence, her mind preoccupied with the upcoming matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the group stage was finally over, the sixteen most powerful contestants were on the verge of engaging in thrilling battles. The top ten would earn the privilege of representing Tempest Fortress City in the state duel </span><span>across</span><span> the whole Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anticipation reached a fever pitch, each of the sixteen competitors was champing at the bit to showcase their mettle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was abuzz with excitement, passionately debating the matches they had just watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's a shoo-in for the championship! I'm sticking to that! Sure, her opponents might have been weak, but she's been knocking them out in one fell swoop every time&mdash;she's in a league of her own!" one spectator asserted with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate Marreese, though! Just like last time, no one can withstand even a single strike from his blade! His attacks are brutal; if you get hit, it's all over!" another spectator retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Tyson's no pushover either! You can tell he's hungry for revenge after coming in second last time! He's got his eyes set on Marreese. I wouldn't be shocked if they go head-to-head again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually reckon Clara from Fantasia Isle is the biggest wild card! Her divine artifact, that iron chain, is a nightmare! She's had every opponent in a stranglehold so far&mdash;nobody can move an inch against her, and they end up throwing in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, give me a break! Let's not overlook Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect! His archery skills are off the charts! His arrows seem to teleport, and they pack such a punch that if you can't dodge, </span><span>you're</span><span> toast! He took out his last three opponents with a single arrow each&mdash;just like it's nothing!" someone else exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Whether it's Marreese, Tyson, Clara, or Osborne, they're all just vying for second place! The championship is as good as Leroy's!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure! Leroy is invincible!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
