  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Newport City, the capital of Rosmandi, wasn't located in the center of the country. Instead, it was perched on the far eastern edge, making it the first place in Rosmandi to greet the sunrise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It also sat right by the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surrounded by mountains to the north and south, Newport City enjoyed a unique climate. The northern mountains were tall and formidable, shielding the city from cold northern winds, ensuring that even in winter, the temperatures remained pleasantly mild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To the south, the mountains were lower and more numerous, but their environment was equally pristine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of Newport City's wealthy residents lived to the south, where they had built sprawling villas and estates atop several of the finest peaks, creating their own private kingdoms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family's main bloodline occupied the best of these peaks, with a stunning view of the ocean from their mountaintop estates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne and his companions disembarked from the airport, they were met by a fleet of luxury cars waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each vehicle bore a distinctive emblem&mdash;a black wolf's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This symbol, a mark of the Augustine family, was a sign of respect and prestige, not only among ordinary citizens but also among the city's elite and officials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The black wolf's head was the crest of the Augustine family, the oldest and most venerable family in Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wolves were pack animals, not the strongest beasts individually, but when united, they could rival any predator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The convoy was there to pick up Osborne and his party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the ninth branch bloodline of the Augustine family, the Dampston branch had come to Newport City to celebrate Godfather's eightieth birthday. Naturally, the main bloodline of the Augustine family, as the hosts, had to give them a warm welcome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was taken aback when he saw the main bloodline's convoy waiting outside the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given that the Augustine family was the oldest family in Rosmandi, he had expected them to have a more grandiose reception, not to be waiting like ordinary passengers outside the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Interesting!" Osborne murmured to himself as he and his entourage approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two people from the waiting convoy immediately came forward to greet them. Among them was a striking woman with a warm smile, who extended her hand towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Augustine, welcome to Newport City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Louisa West, a senior steward from the Augustine family's main bloodline. I'll be handling all your arrangements here&mdash;your schedule, accommodation, everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I look forward to working with you," Louisa said with grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Ms. West," Osborne responded, then turned his attention to the other individual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This person, wearing a faint smile, introduced himself, "I'm Jeremy Augustine, a member of the main bloodline. Welcome to Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's head to your accommodations."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without further ado, Jeremy led Osborne and his group to the waiting luxury cars and took his place in the front vehicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could sense a subtle air of superiority from Jeremy, reflecting his status within the Augustine family's main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he paid it no mind and climbed into one of the luxury cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the convoy moved through the bustling streets of Newport City, Osborne gazed out the window, visibly impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was his first visit to Newport City, and he was immediately struck by its grandeur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every vehicle on the road seemed to be a luxury car, skyscrapers soared along the streets, and even the pedestrians were dressed to the nines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most astonishingly, Newport City had no slums or underground gangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Newport City was renowned for its exceptional safety&mdash;unlike the disorder in Skyefall and Dampston, crime was rare here, and gun violence was almost unheard of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How wonderful," Osborne murmured to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been born right here in Newport City&mdash;his true hometown. If not for his parents' tragic accident, he might never have ended up in Skyefall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, his excitement growing, "Very soon, I'll get to see Godfather! And soon, I'll learn more about my parents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, he noticed the convoy coming to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The vehicles slowly pulled to the side, and another convoy roared past, leaving Osborne stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to Louisa with a puzzled expression. "Ms. West, what's going on? Our convoy just gave way to another one? We, the Augustine family, are the oldest family in Rosmandi. Who on earth are they for us to yield like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa's face flushed with awkwardness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But since Osborne had asked, she had no choice but to explain, "Mr. Augustine, the other convoy belongs to the Yalynch Embassy. Although we, the Augustine family, are indeed the oldest in Rosmandi, in Newport City, we have to show respect to diplomats from various countries."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Respect?" Osborne mused, finding Louisa's choice of words a bit too mild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was more than just respect; it felt like they were being overshadowed and pushed aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Yalynch Embassy, huh? It seems the Augustine family's main bloodline in Newport City isn't quite as untouchable as we thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Interesting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the Yalynch Embassy's convoy finally disappeared from view, the Augustine family's convoy resumed its journey. They quickly left the bustling city center and reached the southern outskirts of Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here, the mountains rose one after another, each peak surrounded by high walls with luxurious estates perched atop them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne glimpsed the Caldwell family's estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then the Hayes family's residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, they arrived in the area reserved for the Augustine family's main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Twelve mountain peaks were exclusively owned by the Augustine family in Newport City.</p><div class="pagination">
