  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you angry?" Emma spoke, still smiling, "Could it be that you have no confidence in maintaining your relationship and are worried that he will fall in love with me and dump you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa became even angrier when she heard this. She was about to speak but suddenly stopped, turning her head to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Osborne had recovered his mental strength and stood up. "I'm fully recovered! Let's keep moving forward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you talk about just now?" Osborne came closer and asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled and said, "We just talked about you, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't talk. Let's go!" Before Emma could finish speaking, Clarissa interrupted her and took Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. He noticed there was something off about the atmosphere between them, and Clarissa looked sullen. But he, at the thought that Clarissa was worried about her relatives, didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" He held Emma's hand again, about to tear open the dimensional space and continue on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, he suddenly felt that when he held Emma's hand, she gently tickled his palm with her finger. He was stunned by her flirting movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly and turned to look at Emma, only to see her maintain her composure as if she had done nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and didn't dwell on it. Maybe it was just an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne performed interdimensional travel again to get to Dragon Scale Island, which was several hundred miles away, and stopped again when they were 12 miles away from their destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dragon Scale Island is ahead. There's a bit of time left until the agreed time. I need to restore my mental strength to its peak state." After Osborne finished speaking, he began to recover his mental strength again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Emma both walked to a distance so as not to disturb Osborne. Clarissa had calmed down at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled and said, "Clarissa, you seem to have calmed down. Did you accept it? I see. It's acceptable that a brilliant man like Osborne has several girlfriends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa stared at Emma and said, "Are you trying to piss me off? I don't know what you are up to, but if you like Osborne, that's your business. If he likes you too, I will have no issues with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But forgive me for being blunt, Osborne won't like you! From what I know about him, he might fall in love with another woman, but it couldn't possibly be you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Emma was stunned and frowned. "Why couldn't it be me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you don't know how to love someone! You just want a man who is good enough for you!" After saying that, Clarissa just ignored Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stood there in a daze. "I don't know how to love someone? I just want a man who is good enough for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's words seemed to have a profound impact on Emma, who did not speak to Clarissa again and focused on adjusting her state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Osborne finally stood up. At this time, his state had returned to its peak, and the large amount of star power he absorbed had further enhanced his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's almost time!" Osborne murmured, "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> probably didn't expect that I could recover my mental strength so quickly. They must assume that performing interdimensional travel will consume a significant amount of my mental strength, so I won't be able to maintain my peak state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold look in his eyes, he added, "No matter what plots or traps you have, I will foil them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne said to Clarissa and Emma, "We need a battle plan! I have the dark power, so I will sneak in ahead of time to check the situation on Dragon Scale Island and identify the location of the hostages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I identify the location, I will send a message to you, and then you go and </span><span>rescue the hostages, while I will hold the enemies back. You should leave immediately after rescuing them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa said worriedly, "Osborne, what are you going to do? There must be a lot of enemies, and you can't handle it alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "I have the spatial power, so I am sure I can escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he said so, he had no confidence at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> be unprepared since they knew he had the spatial power? They would definitely freeze the space. If there were too many enemies, he wouldn't even have a chance to perform dimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's still too dangerous." Clarissa bit her lip, disagreeing with this plan. She took a deep breath and said, "Once you identify the location of the hostages, Emma can go and rescue them! I want to fight with you, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma looked at Clarissa at this time, frowning slightly. She seemed to have understood something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a moment and said, "Let's take action as Clarissa said! Osborne, you may not be able to hold the enemies at bay by yourself, and it will make it riskier for me to rescue the hostages. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> don't know I've joined you, so it's most appropriate for me to go and rescue them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked worried, but in the end, he nodded and said, "Okay, I'll take action now. Wait for my message!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
