  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo and Armstrong stepped inside, bold and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were among the top-tier Class S warriors. With their formidable skills, danger didn't even cross their minds, nor did they worry about potential traps left by the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Augustine family had the capability to leave any threats behind, they would have unleashed them during the previous battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they zeroed in on the energy signature, it grew stronger and more compelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep within a secluded chamber, Zoe's face was as pale as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let them find us! Please, don't let them discover our hiding place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This room served as a makeshift safe house, built from sturdy materials that could withstand the might of even Class S fighters nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Zoe could only pray that the intruders wouldn't stumble upon their refuge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, while the safe house was fortified against physical threats, it wasn't particularly adept at masking energy signatures. At that very moment, Anastasia lay unconscious, her body radiating powerful energy as she underwent a significant transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Gerardo and Armstrong, the intensity of the energy emanating from her was like a beacon, guiding them closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they found themselves right outside the safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Zoe's heart raced as the sound of approaching footsteps grew louder, each step tightening the coil of anxiety in her chest. She held her breath, panic taking over her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong's voice rang out, a crooked grin on his face. "Wow, an upscale safe house!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like there's some real treasure hidden here. I can sense that incredible vitality emanating from the inside! This has to be one of the Draco Group's highest-grade safe houses. Even a standard Class S would struggle to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's definitely something valuable in there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the kicker. We're both top-notch Class S warrior. This kind of safe house won't keep us out. Who's going to tackle it, me or you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo furrowed his brow. "Treasure, huh? I have a sneaking suspicion there are people inside, not just goodies. I'm curious who could be using such a top-tier safe house. The Augustine family is already down and out. Why aren't they fleeing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out," Gerardo said, stepping aside to signal Armstrong to take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll handle this," Armstrong replied with a shrug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for the fortified door, his fingers ablaze with a brilliant energy that radiated like a laser. In an instant, he sliced through the heavy metal like it was butter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the door collapsed under the force of his kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrified shriek pierced the air, followed instantly by a probing mental attack that aimed straight at Armstrong's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the mental assault was far too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Armstrong brushed it aside and peered inside with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, would you look at that! There are people in here! Two women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong's eyes widened in surprise as he took in the scene&mdash;Anastasia, unconscious, and Zoe, her face painted with shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe watched helplessly as her mental attack had no effect on Armstrong, dissipating like mist in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart sank. Zoe now held Class A status with exceptionally strong mental strength. By Isa's reckoning, her power was divine, something that could even influence those above her level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here she was, easily brushed aside by Armstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic tightened its grip on her heart as she realized she was no match for these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair clouded her thoughts as Zoe tried to come to terms with the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stepped into the safe house, his gaze sweeping over Zoe before landing on Anastasia. His eyes widened with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What incredible vitality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in closer, the energy radiating from Anastasia catching him off guard. "Is that a Class S power fluctuation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, a Class S at such a young age? Her physique...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo pointed decisively at Anastasia, his enthusiasm palpable. He could sense her extraordinary potential and envisioned taking her back to refine her with the finest Human Slave cultivation serum, transforming her into a formidable Human Slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong raised an eyebrow, puzzled by Gerardo's sudden fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, she was just another woman, even if she was a Class S. He had no interest in competing for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast his eyes around the room, searching for anything else of value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Gerardo had already moved toward Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Anastasia's power erupted as if she sensed an impending threat, launching a fierce attack on Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Gerardo threw a punch, effortlessly shattering the energy that surged toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! She can protect herself automatically? She's definitely something special! But that level of attack won't faze me. You'd be better off coming along quietly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo pressed on, undaunted by the assault, inching closer to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come any closer!" Zoe shouted, unleashing her own attack in a desperate attempt to shield Anastasia from Gerardo's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Gerardo stood before them, his hand reaching out toward Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's mine!" Gerardo declared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
