  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess of Fate, are you still pretending to be asleep?" Isa's voice echoed through the dimly lit dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had been there, he would have been utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was the Goddess of Fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was one of the most powerful goddesses from the Court of the Sun, a key player in the battle against Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Isa was addressing Clarissa as the Goddess of Fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Isa finished speaking, Clarissa's eyes snapped open, revealing a gaze filled with complexity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had witnessed this, he might have thought that Clarissa had been possessed by the Dark Deity; her demeanor and aura had shifted entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Clarissa sighed and slowly began to move her body, as if shaking off the remnants of sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Isa, her expression calm yet layered with unspoken thoughts. "How did you know I was pretending?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "It's simple! You should have woken up ages ago! The only reason you haven't is that you've been grappling with the memories of reincarnation Clarissa and are reluctant to face the reality of your life now&mdash;specifically, your relationship with Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Isa's words, Clarissa's expression grew even more conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she merely shook her head, her voice firm. "You're mistaken! Clarissa is not just a reincarnation; I am Clarissa, and Clarissa is me! What I've received are merely memories from my past life! I am still Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at her in surprise. "I'm impressed that you would think like that! I expected you to follow in the footsteps of the God of Time, prioritizing your past life over your current one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa raised an eyebrow, taken aback. "The God of Time has regained her memories? No wonder I feel the energies of this realm reviving! It seems like those old friends are starting to come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa studied her for a moment before asking, "I'm curious, who exactly are you? I can sense that you're not a reincarnation of any old friend; you're just an ordinary girl! Yet, you know so much! And I can feel the power of the God of Night within you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled. "You're right; I'm just an ordinary girl, not the reincarnation of any deity! And yes, you're correct&mdash;I do possess the power of the God of Night because he is my mentor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His power was bestowed upon me at birth! He also gave me a mission: to find you and save this fragile world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night actually passed his power to you? Why would he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa interrupted her, "Don't ask! I can't divulge that information, and you shouldn't ask either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just know that my mentor is involved in something significant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you inquire further, Lord Malevolence might sense it, and that could jeopardize my mentor's plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious expression crossed Clarissa's face as she furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, with a hint of anguish in her voice, she asked, "Is he... still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa burst into a smile. "Looks like you can't quite forget my mentor! But now, you belong to Osborne! What have you two been up to? You should remember, right? If not, I've recorded everything; you can take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Clarissa's face flushed a deep crimson, and she shot a glare at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're annoying! If my powers were fully restored, I'd squash you right now! Even if your mentor is alive, he wouldn't be able to stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a flood of memories rushed through Clarissa's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled everything she had shared with Osborne, including the moment when she had given him a blowjob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa immediately shut her eyes and let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to remind me! I've told you before, I am Clarissa, not the Goddess of Fate anymore! Osborne is my man, and he will always be my Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was resolute, a fierce determination radiating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Is that really what you thought? I expected it would take more time to convince you to pass your fate power to Osborne. After all, you've reached Class S, and if you're unwilling to transfer that power, there's nothing I can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned. "Transfer my fate power to him? The reason I've been hesitating to wake up is because of this very decision... I've been torn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what's your decision now?" Isa pressed gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Clarissa replied, "I've said it before: I'm Clarissa, and I'm Osborne's woman! As for the God of Night, he and I were never meant to be in the last life, and that hasn't changed in this one! Perhaps that's just fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I'm Goddess of Fate, I can't change it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Clarissa's demeanor shifted, her resolve solidifying like steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at her with newfound respect. "Goddess of Fate, you've really impressed me! But trust me, you won't regret this decision!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mysterious smile, she continued, "Now, let's find a moment to transfer your fate power to Osborne. We've got a lot to do, and time is of the essence..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
