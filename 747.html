  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are many Secluded Families like the Lambert family in Rosmandi, and even more throughout the world! Besides them, there are numerous hidden clans and organizations. Their strength is formidable, and some of them are even more powerful than the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They usually do not get involved in worldly disputes and have a longer lineage. Their entire focus is on enhancing their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because they are so focused, they are powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you ever encounter such a Secluded Family, clan, or organization, it's best not to provoke them casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised. He hadn't expected there to be families, clans, and organizations in the world that didn't pursue wealth or power but were instead dedicated to secluded cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that there were many hidden masters in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Caleb, we understand. We won't go looking for trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb smiled and nodded. "That's good to hear. But if you do run into trouble, don't hold back&mdash;fight back if you must."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can just bully someone from the Augustine family! The Augustine family will always have your back. And even if the Augustine family can't hold the line, there's still Godfather and the Draco Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I won't take up any more of your time. I'll have someone help you with your disguises. Everyone attending the Honor Quest Ceremony will be a master, so even with skin masks, they could easily see through them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Caleb clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman in her thirties entered the room, holding a photograph. It showed a handsome man and a beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are who you'll be disguised as Axell and Maia. They're siblings who left the Lambert family at a young age to train on their own, so even the members of the Lambert family are not very familiar with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only Ms. Aleena Lambert from the Lambert family knows your real identities. Even the younger generation of the Lambert family is unaware, so you need to be well-disguised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aleena is a good friend of mine, and she'll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Caleb waved to the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help them with their disguises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman began to apply makeup to Osborne and Emma's faces. Her technique was remarkably skillful. She used the finest materials, allowing the makeup to seamlessly blend into their skin and subtly alter their facial contours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary makeup removers wouldn't work on this kind of makeup; only a special method could restore its original appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the disguises were finished, Osborne and Emma were both surprised by their reflections in the mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that should do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The time is almost here; you should start preparing! Aleena will come to Newport City to pick you up, and then you'll fly directly to Tethynia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, do not reveal your identities in Tethynia. It's one of the strongholds of the Aberrants, and their power there is overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your identities are exposed, it will be very difficult for us to rescue you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone within the Augustine family asks, I'll tell them you're both focusing on your training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb finished his instructions, Osborne and Emma both nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, led by Caleb, Osborne and Emma left the Augustine family estate and arrived at an ordinary house on the outskirts of Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, wait here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aleena will come to pick you up. Here is some information about Aleena and the Lambert family to help you conceal your identities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb left them with some documents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm off. Make sure you come back safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb waved his hand and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately picked up the documents about the Lambert family and quickly began to go through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family has been secluded in Pelycosaur Mountain. Over four hundred years ago, after a great conflict with their enemies, even though they won, they were nearly annihilated. To ensure the continuation of their family, they went into seclusion and have remained so ever since."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aleena is one of the highly respected leaders of the Lambert family and a top-tier Class AAA metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most outstanding member of the younger generation of the Lambert family is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly skimmed through the Lambert family information, and Emma leaned over, joining him. She seemed to be intentionally close, her whole body pressed against his. Osborne could even feel her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit exasperated, Osborne said, "Emma, could you keep some distance? We're supposed to be siblings now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma laughed and replied, "So what if we're siblings? Siblings are supposed to be close, right? Besides, it's just a fake identity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she directly hugged Osborne's arm, pressing her ample chest against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to pull his arm away, but when he realized he couldn't, he gave up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued studying the Lambert family information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were basic details, not classified, and Osborne quickly memorized them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of a car engine came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family members had arrived!</span></p><div class="pagination">
