  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed deeply to the elderly man,</span><span> their attitudes full of reverence. Even Vincent's grandfather, Declan, a member of the Augustine family's main bloodline, was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Osborne and the unconscious Owen, everyone was paying their respects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in surprise at the elderly man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man had a head full of silver hair and appeared even older than Godfather. Yet, his spirit was vigorous, his gaze sharp, and his frame tall. From his facial features, one could imagine that he must have been exceptionally handsome in his youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "They say this man is a butler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A butler for which family? How does even Declan treat him with such respect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why can't I sense any aura from him? Does this mean he's just an ordinary person, or...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that, like Godfather, he is also a Class S Supreme Overlord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was startled. He knew the Augustine family members wouldn't show such deference to a mere mortal. He realized that this elderly man named Wesson had to be a Class S Supreme Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesson waved his hand and smiled, saying, "There's no need for such formality, everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few of the older members of the Augustine family stepped forward and began conversing with him in low voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of the distraction, Osborne moved quietly beside Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, who is this old man?" he asked in a hushed tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma replied softly, "Mr. Wesson Augustine is Godfather's butler. He has served Godfather for seventy years. He has worked for Godfather, protecting him since Godfather was ten years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is also a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather rarely manages the family affairs directly. If he gives an order, it's almost always Mr. Wesson Augustine who carries it out. Mr. Wesson Augustine is essentially Godfather's representative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he really is a Class S Supreme Overlord warrior! But he's Godfather's butler and his representative? Since Godfather went to deal with the Aberrants, does that mean all matters concerning the Draco Group are now decided by him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed at Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson looked back at Osborne, nodding slightly with a friendly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly responded in kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, everyone, stop crowding around me. I have two announcements to make today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson waved his hand, signaling for the crowd to disperse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, the war initiated by the Aberrants has ended, but their ambitions haven't disappeared. They could launch another attack at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, the defense of the six coastal regions will be handled by the Draco Group's Draco Armed Services Branch. All of you can return to Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Wesson finished speaking, a collective sigh of relief swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, the Draco Armed Services Branch is here. We don't have to worry about the defense here anymore, and we can finally return to Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The war is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people began to cheer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and asked Emma, "Emma, how much do you know about the Draco Armed Services Branch? How strong are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma quickly replied, "I don't know much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I know is that the Draco Armed Services Branch is Godfather's private armed force, independent of the Augustine family's control. Mr. Wesson Augustine is the deputy commander of the Draco Armed Services Branch. Decades ago, it was Godfather, leading the Draco Armed Services Branch, who crushed the Aberrants and drove the King of the Aberrants out of Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one knows exactly how powerful the Draco Armed Services Branch is. It's said that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of Class AAA warriors among them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Draco Armed Services Branch is Godfather's sharpest sword and the sturdiest shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Draco Armed Services Branch exists, the Draco Group will remain safe, and our Augustine family will always have a fallback!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Emma finished speaking, a look of admiration appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Godfather's personal armed force, and since Godfather was the head of the Augustine family, Emma naturally felt proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but click his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Dozens or even hundreds of Class AAA warriors? Is that why the Aberrants, despite their strength, didn't dare launch an all-out war and instead tried to secretly plot for the Divine Bone Crystal...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this is Godfather's trump card against the Aberrants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing about the strength of Godfather's private armed forces, Osborne suddenly felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Draco Armed Services Branch, the ten training bases that Godfather rewarded him seemed average, far inferior to the might of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many more secret armed forces does Godfather have?" Osborne wondered silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesson continued, "Now, onto the second matter, which is the most important one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, the crowd fell silent, eagerly awaiting Wesson's next announcement, curious about what important matter he had to declare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson smiled slightly, "Who ranked first in this family heir selection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped forward slowly. "That would be me! Mr. Wesson Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! You are young but capable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your responsibility is immense. Godfather has asked me to inform you that in one month, the Augustine family will hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honor Quest Ceremony?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? An Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be kidding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Godfather mistaken? How could Osborne deserve this?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
