  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As the moment arrives, I will overturn the tables and reign supreme, showing you all who truly holds sway in this family!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Osborne declared his ambition, Isa erupted into a cascade of giggles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wrapped her arms around his neck, planting a tender kiss on his lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't wait to see you overturn the tables and claim your throne," she said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile was as sweet as honey. Then, her gaze shifted abruptly to the horizon. A sneer played on her lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marvin is back," she announced.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your hunch was right; he's found reinforcements."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing those words, Osborne turned anxious. His entire frame stiffened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should we do? Flee?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's response was a soft chuckle. "Flee? Why would we flee? If anyone should run, it's them."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No sooner had she spoken than two figures materialized before them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One was Marvin, and the other, older and exuding a mightier aura, was none other than Peter Williamson, the former head of the Williamson family and another S-class Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Father, it's her!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's Night, who topped the Godson Rankings! She injured me and forced me to hand over a top-grade divine artifact."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin jabbed a finger at Isa. His face contorted with rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Father, you must end her. Avenge me! She's merely an AA-class warrior, yet she had the audacity to wound me so. Her life must be the price for this affront..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Marvin could finish, he was silenced by a resounding slap from Peter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stunned, Marvin clutched his face, staring at his father in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Father, you..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter, whose eyes were blazing with fury, slapped Marvin again and wished to strike him dead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa broke the silence. Her voice was calm yet cutting, "What's this? Did you not eat? Or is it because he's your son that you can't bring yourself to hit him?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Give him three more slaps. Each slap must knock out at least one of his teeth. Don't stop until you've done it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words left both Marvin and Osborne in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They struggled to figure out her intention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, the scene that unfolded next was even more astonishing. At her command, Peter shuddered. A cruel glint flashed in his eyes as he proceeded to slap Marvin thrice in rapid succession.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each blow sent a tooth flying from Marvin's mouth. Despite being an S-class Supreme Overlord, Marvin was left in a daze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring Marvin, Peter turned to Isa, bowing deeply.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Night, I am at fault for not disciplining him properly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This incident is our Williamson family's mistake. We are prepared to compensate for all losses. Ms. Night, I beg for your mercy to spare my son's life."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After his plea, Peter remained bowed, not daring to lift his gaze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With keen eyes, Osborne found the beads of cold sweat trickling down from Peter's cheeks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was too dumbfounded to utter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze shifted to Isa, seeking answers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter was Marvin's father and a former member of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings. He possessed formidable strength despite his age and the slight decline that had seen him fall from the ranking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he cowered before Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made no sense.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Isa could best Marvin with ease, she was no match for a seasoned S-class warrior like Peter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't fathom it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's lips curled into a faint smile as she whispered into his ear, "Surprised? I hail from a mysterious force; he fears the power behind me, not me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for Osborne's reaction, she turned her cold gaze to Peter. "For your sake, I won't take his life. But the agreed compensation must not be diminished in any way."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter's face lit up with a mixture of surprise and relief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Ms. Night! Thank you! We have prepared a top-grade divine artifact."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter removed a pair of gloves from his hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quivered as he spoke, "Ms. Night, this is the Thundergod Gloves, which are integrated with the Volt Hammer. The Volt Hammer is merely its accessory. By wearing the Thundergod Gloves and wielding the Volt Hammer, you will no longer suffer its electric shocks. Instead, the power of the Volt Hammer will be enhanced. Among the top-grade divide artifacts, the Thundergod Gloves are one of the most potent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Furthermore, once you don the gloves, the Volt Hammer will never fall from your grasp. Even if you discard it, you can summon it back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter where the Volt Hammer is, it will return to your call."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter offered the explanation and glanced at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned. "The Thundergod Gloves can summon the Volt Hammer? So, the Volt Hammer you offered as a prize for the Honor Quest Ceremony! Even if I took it, you could summon it back!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter's expression turned sheepish.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed, that was our intention. The Volt Hammer is incredibly valuable..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rolled his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He muttered under his breath, "Shameless!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Williamson family knows no bounds to their deceit."</p><div class="pagination">
