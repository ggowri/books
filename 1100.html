  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian continued, "Even now, if I were to face Helios again, he'd likely still easily defeat me. Even with the Godfather's scepter and the advantage of being within the Augustine family's domain, my chances of beating him are slim."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian fixed his gaze on Osborne. "Osborne, I'm telling you this because if you're truly preparing to go head-to-head with the League of Divine Descent, you must be ready for the worst possible outcome! Yes, you've grown stronger. Stronger than me, even. But don't let pride blind you, and don't think you can relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There will always be someone stronger than you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must continue to push yourself, to grow more powerful if you ever hope to stand a chance against Helios Thornberry. You need that strength for yourself and to protect the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face became deadly serious. He had known Helios was universally recognized as the strongest warrior on Blue Planet, holding the top spot on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings for two hundred years. But Osborne never truly grasped just how mighty Helios was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, a Class S was still a Class S. No matter how strong Helios was, the gap couldn't be that wide. He thought of other top-tier warriors like Gerardo, Armstrong, and Sin, all ranked highly on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings. Surely, they weren't far behind Helios.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne understood how naive that thinking was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios wasn't just above the rest. He was leagues beyond them. He could likely defeat even the likes of Gerardo or Armstrong with a single blow, while Osborne himself couldn't dream of doing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were to face Helios in battle, the odds were clear. He wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I understand!" Osborne took a deep breath. "I'll keep getting stronger! No matter how powerful Helios is, I'll defeat him one day. And as for my parents, I will find them! I've already beaten Gerardo. He's run back to his hideout. Once I've dealt with things here, I'll settle things with him for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it'll be Emperor Dare and Reginald's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll hunt down everyone involved in my parents' disappearance, one by one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled and nodded. "Don't put too much pressure on yourself. You've already done more than enough. Even if Helios were your age, he couldn't have accomplished what you have. In fact, he wouldn't have come close! So go ahead. Fearlessly pursue what you need to do. I will always stand behind you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Then, let's deal with this group from the League of Divine Descent. Grandpa, I need you to continue pretending you're seriously injured and unconscious. When their reinforcements arrive, we'll give them a surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded. "Alright. You're the Godfather now. I'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian laid back into the wooden crate, masking his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Osborne dispel the Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's control, those outside the Realm had neither seen nor heard what transpired within. As the light faded, everyone looked on with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian remained lying in the wooden box, still unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at them calmly and said, "There's still one more battle ahead. Once it's over, we'll return to the Augustine Estate. Everyone, move back. And make sure my grandfather is well taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned and headed toward the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm coming with you!" Emma rushed out and stood by his side, clinging to his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then shook his head. "No, you can't. The upcoming battle is too dangerous. Without Class S strength, you won't be able to protect yourself. Even Class S fighters might not make it out alive! Stay here and protect everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was a little disappointed by Osborne's words, but she didn't argue. She knew Osborne was right. Her strength wasn't enough. Following him would only be a distraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then take this," Emma said, handing Osborne the Swallow Shield, her eyes filled with determination. "You better come back safe. If anything happens to you, I'll go down fighting. I swear, I won't live without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused before accepting the shield. In return, he pulled out a divine artifact dagger and gave it to Emma. "Take this for protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger was of higher quality than the Swallow Shield, something he'd claimed after defeating Sin. It was a top-grade divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma didn't refuse and tucked the dagger away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne patted Emma on the head before turning away and heading toward the battlefield's edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, the battle between the League of Divine Descent and the clones of the Aberrants was still raging. The League had around fifty fighters left, while the clones numbered just over a hundred. The fight was intense, but the League appeared to have control, dragging things out deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stalling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and suddenly shouted, "Everett, are you all useless? Or are you just buying time? I'll give you five more minutes. If you don't wipe them out by then, I'll wipe you out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
