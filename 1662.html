  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of adventure electrified the air as everyone eagerly agreed to follow Angelo up Celestial Sword Peak in search of the legendary Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the ten miners were on board, unable to refuse when Angelo himself insisted they join the expedition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miracle Elixirs were known to grow in the toughest of rocks, with roots that burrowed deep into Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the miners' expertise, extracting the elixirs intact would be a time-consuming challenge, and any damage to them would diminish their potency significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the entire group fell in line behind Angelo, ready to embark on their climb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, through Riley, learned the situation unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, excitement mingling with disbelief, "So, there really is a Miracle Elixir up there? And besides the elixir, there's a chance of finding even rarer treasures&mdash;like advanced techniques?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of ambition sparked in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this Celestial Sword Peak is bound to be dangerous! If it weren't, Angelo would have gone solo to claim the elixirs and treasures for himself. The fact that he's bringing others along suggests he's looking to share the risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne calmed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Deity King like Angelo is being cautious about Celestial Sword Peak. I can't afford to act recklessly! I'll just follow behind and assess the situation. If the opportunity arises, I'll snatch that Miracle Elixir for myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held back for a moment, observing Angelo and the others as they slowly made their way up the towering peak. To Osborne, their hundred-plus figures resembled a swarm of ants scaling the colossal Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain was steep&mdash;almost impossibly so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, flying straight to the summit would have been the best option. Though the peak rose a staggering 600 miles, at their flying speed, they could reach the top in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angelo and his team opted for a more hands-on approach, climbing without using their divine powers, moving like ordinary people as they ascended the sheer cliffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, their formidable Divine Bodies allowed them to make decent progress despite the challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the reasoning behind this?" Osborne pondered, perplexed, and turned to Riley for clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley quickly provided an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, Angelo mentioned that Celestial Sword Peak is a sacred site for the Deathborn. There's a terrifying force lurking nearby that could be triggered by flight. If one were to take to the skies, it could lead to disastrous consequences&mdash;Divine Bodies getting shredded! Even a Deity King warrior might not withstand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath caught at Riley's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A force so powerful that even Deity Kings can't resist it? And flying could provoke it? Thank goodness I asked; otherwise, I might have soared right into danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious as the weight of the situation settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dangers of Divine Peak Nine are far more numerous than I could have imagined! I must tread carefully and avoid any impulsive actions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne began his own ascent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he concealed himself in a parallel space, he still refrained from flying. Instead, he approached the base of Celestial Sword Peak and began climbing up the steep rock face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he wouldn't have to scale it bare-handed; his method would be far easier than Angelo's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne trailed behind them, keeping a distance of about six miles, steadily making his way toward the summit of Celestial Sword Peak alongside the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At an elevation of 600 miles, the ascent was nothing short of monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the group encountered no major mishaps along the way. After half a day of climbing, they finally reached a point just a few miles from the summit of Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, the fog thickened, swirling around them like a living entity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howling winds whipped through the air, biting into their Divine Bodies and leaving behind streaks of blood. Yet, no one dared to use their divine powers for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were too close to the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any display of power would likely alert the Deathborn that surely roamed the summit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, they'd be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo whispered to the group, his voice barely cutting through the wind, "Wait here for me. I'll scout ahead and see what we're up against."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nods of agreement rippled through the crowd as they watched Angelo's form shift into a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved with the grace of a lizard, darting up the slope until he vanished into the thick mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, maintained his vantage point through Satan's Eye, tracking Angelo's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost to the top," he murmured, his heart racing as he watched Angelo stealthily reach the summit of Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the peak, a vast platform lay waiting, but due to the angle of his view, Osborne couldn't make out what lay upon it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye, while equipped with powerful X-ray vision, was significantly weakened by the oppressive atmosphere of Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could see was Angelo peering cautiously over the edge of the platform, a frown creasing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Angelo chose not to ascend onto the platform. He quickly retreated back down the slope, urgency in his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group watched him with bated breath, anticipation hanging thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he reached them, Angelo's expression was grave. "There are indeed Deathborns up there, performing some kind of ritual."</span></p><div class="pagination">
