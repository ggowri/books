  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Kurt couldn't help but curse, frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Who the hell buys Miracle Elixirs like this?" He had attended plenty of Miracle Elixir auctions and understood the market better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when someone was desperate, the price never soared absurdly high&mdash;there was always a limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was witnessing something unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't just spending five hundred Celestial Crystals on a single red Miracle Elixir. He was slapping down two thousand Celestial Crystals for four of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one fetching a price of five hundred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After each winning bid, Osborne shot Kurt a look of disdain, a smirk plastered across his face. Kurt gritted his teeth. After tolerating it the first two times, he felt the strain creeping in. When Osborne turned to him with that contemptuous gaze for the fourth time, Kurt snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?" he demanded, fury evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally clicked for Kurt. A person who could throw down two thousand Celestial Crystals couldn't possibly be a nobody. There was no way they were without connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even considering his status, two thousand Celestial Crystals was not pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter family was a Dukedom Level Power, true, but with so many relatives, the amount of Essence Crystals each member got was finite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Kurt was the son of a Supernal Deity King, that kind of cash was significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who didn't regard two thousand Celestial Crystals as a lot of money wasn't someone to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt locked his gaze onto Osborne, as if trying to see right through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, a calm radiance in the chaos around them. "Didn't you say it yourself? I'm just a country bumpkin&mdash;someone who's not even worthy to compete with you for a Miracle Elixir, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!" Kurt shouted, his frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet down! This is a Miracle Elixir auction, not a battleground. Any disruption will not be tolerated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A commanding voice echoed through the room, silencing the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Supernal Deity King of the Luminous Commerce Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the authority wielded by the Supernal Deity King made Kurt regain his composure, albeit temporarily. He fixed his steely gaze on Osborne and hissed, "Are you going to tell me your name or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chuckle slipped from Osborne's lips. "You want to know my name? Since you're so eager to ask, I'll indulge you. My name is... Theodore Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne finished, the room echoed with two astonished voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was Kurt's, filled with disbelief, and the other belonged to the Supernal Deity King of the Luminous Commerce Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were equally taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt stared at Osborne in shock. "Theodore? You mean you're the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;Theodore? This can't be right! The Seven Young Deity Kings were just in the East Zone three days ago. How could you possibly be here in the West Zone so quickly? It must be a coincidence of names!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice may have been low, but Osborne heard every word, his expression shifting from amusement to genuine surprise as he regarded Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "He knows who I am?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knows about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's unexpected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like he said, just three days ago, we were still in the East Zone. Given the distance between the East and West Zones, news doesn't travel that fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took me two days to get here, and I was flying the Supreme Malevolence Airship at a hundred times the normal speed. Under regular circumstances, it would take about two hundred days to make this journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I'm right, news should be even slower to spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he is, talking about the Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We only started using that title a little over a month ago when we helped the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, does the Baxter family have some sort of special intel network?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a terminal device for ultra-long-distance communication that covers all of Celestara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained a calm facade, though confusion flickered in his eyes. "The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? What are you talking about? I've only heard of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings! There's no mention of a Seven Young Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flatly denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until he was sure he could handle the Baxter family, he didn't want to reveal his true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Baxter family had betrayed the Human Community, aligning themselves with Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his companions had just defeated the young geniuses of various clans in the East Zone, killed one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, and wiped out over five hundred Deity Kings. Their talent and potential had surely raised concerns within the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they discovered Osborne and his companions were in the West Zone, they would likely pressure the Baxter family to eliminate them before they could grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne decided to keep his identity under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether he could successfully hide it was another matter entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Osborne with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he let out a cold laugh. "You're right! There's no way you could be the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. Besides, just three days ago, they were still in the East Zone, likely hiding from the Paramount Supreme Clan's pursuit. They couldn't possibly have made it to the West Zone this quickly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kurt dismissed the thought, his gaze turning icy as he fixed it on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you're too scared to reveal your real name. I must've overestimated you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
