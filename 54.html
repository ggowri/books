  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the end, Clarissa shook her head. &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. He really doesn&rsquo;t have any intention of pursuing me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that said, she was suddenly somewhat depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She preferred if Osborne had deceived her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, her superpower assured her that it was his truthful answer rather than a lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did she misunderstand Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was he attempting to be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard not out of a desire to be with her? If not, what was his intention? Did he intend to harm her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna felt compelled to uncover the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at that moment, something strange happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a weird dark cloud drifted overhead, unleashing a downpour that enveloped Radcliffe Manor, accompanied by rumbling thunder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why is it raining so heavily all of a sudden? There&rsquo;s no thunderstorm in today&rsquo;s weather forecast,&rdquo; Ophelia exclaimed in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at Ophelia, aware of her long-standing fear of thunder. In the past, whenever there had been thunder, he had instinctively stepped forward to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, he ignored her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia shrank back with fright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unaware of her unease, Wesley said casually, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be stunned. The weather in Mayby City is always unpredictable.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne abruptly shouted, &ldquo;Something is wrong!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His Satan&rsquo;s Eye instantly started pulsating wildly, and a strong sense of impending crisis surged within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone&rsquo;s eyes turned to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Donna asked, frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a straight face, Osborne refrained from an immediate reply. Instead, he fixed his gaze in a single direction. His Satan&rsquo;s Eye pierced through the dense rain and fog, extending over half a mile, observing the surroundings outside Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, he became alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an attack!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, everyone grew nervous, but they soon calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna glared at him and said icily, &ldquo;Osborne, are you trying to evade my next question? You should make up a better excuse.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul, standing behind Clarissa, sneered, &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense here. Nearly a hundred guards are protecting and patrolling the periphery of the manor. If there is really an attack, I will be informed right away.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nodded and warned, &ldquo;Osborne, don&rsquo;t play tricks. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll deem your identity verification unsuccessful. Let&rsquo;s proceed with the questioning.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but curse, &ldquo;I told you, there&rsquo;s an attack. Numerous and formidable enemies are on their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a fucking emergency. Do you still want to ask questions? Damn it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Osborne immediately rushed to Clarissa, grabbed her, and ran away with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His sudden scolding shocked and irritated Donna.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In all her life, no one had ever dared to reprimand her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, at the sight of Osborne&rsquo;s actions, she grew anxious at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop! Stop him!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, even without Donna&rsquo;s order, Paul had already launched an attack. He angrily punched Osborne with lightning speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne felt tremendous pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was definitely stronger than Milo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not daring to confront him directly, Osborne utilized Satan&rsquo;s Eye to slow down Paul&rsquo;s movements and barely managed to evade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let go of Ms. Radcliffe. You really have bad intentions and want to harm her. I will kill you,&rdquo; Paul shouted angrily with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was on the verge of unleashing his full strength to take Osborne&rsquo;s life when suddenly something unexpected occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a boom, a bolt of lightning tore through the sky, twisted toward their location, and struck down with alarming speed. In an instant, everyone&rsquo;s hair stood on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s Satan&rsquo;s Eye activated wildly, signaling something grave was afoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without hesitation, Osborne swiftly hugged Clarissa, covering her ears and protecting her tightly in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Deafening noises echoed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, a fierce bolt of lightning struck the roof directly above them. Instantly, the surroundings were illuminated with bright flashes, and the thunderous roar left their eardrums ringing and heads buzzing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a lightning strike!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, over half of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards collapsed on the platform. Both Wesley and Ophelia felt a sudden numbness throughout their bodies, followed by unconsciousness as black blood trickled from their ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t a natural lightning strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Donna, Paul, and the others still standing looked up at the sky in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was seething with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is the elemental metahuman with the power of thunder and lightning, and it&rsquo;s Raymond once more. Damn it!&rdquo; Donna roared, casting a glance at Clarissa, who appeared unharmed in Osborne&rsquo;s arms with her eyes wide open. She soon breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, another bolt of lightning struck down wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, protect Clarissa! Raymond, you bastard! You can&rsquo;t hurt Clarissa while I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that said, Donna swiftly ascended into the air under Osborne&rsquo;s shocked gaze.</p><div class="pagination">
