  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana reminded, "You just need to drop the first drop of blood on the Star Token, and it will bind to your aura. If you encounter danger, just tap the Star Token three times, and I will sense it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you're not extremely far from me or in a completely sealed space, I can teleport to you instantly through the Star Token to protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, Osborne eagerly cut his finger and dropped blood onto the Star Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the Star Token emitted a dazzling light, enveloping Osborne entirely. Its power gradually synchronized with Osborne's aura, and then the light slowly dimmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fiddled with the Star Token in his hand, pondering, "Although the Star Token has no direct offensive ability, it can passively trigger a defense mechanism in deadly crises, teleporting me to a safe place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although it offers limited help in enhancing my strength, it provides me with an extra layer of security."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I hang it on the Warfare Ancient Tree, could it further enhance its power? If it evolves into an Imperial Artifact in the future, its might would surely become even greater."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought flashed by, and the Star Token in Osborne's hand instantly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, it appeared in his Soul Current Ocean, hanging on the trunk of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression suddenly changed, and she curiously asked, "Why has the aura of the Star Token on you disappeared? How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this and said, "You can sense the aura of the Star Token?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded and replied, "I mentioned before that the five Star Tokens are interconnected and can be used for mutual assistance. One serves as the main, while the other four are secondary, and I hold the main Star Token. In theory, I can sense the location, aura, and status of the other four secondary Star Tokens."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you don't actively seek my help, as long as the Star Token's defense mechanism is triggered, I can still sense it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the moment you put away the Star Token, I could no longer sense its aura, as if the connection had been severed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne simply smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So the Star Token actually has a primary and secondary distinction. Ms. Alba can actively sense the status of the other four secondary Star Tokens through the primary Star Token."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Warfare Ancient Tree possesses the ability to suppress all Sacred Artifacts. Once the Star Token is hung on it, all its aura will be completely concealed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, with the presence of the Warfare Ancient Tree, my Star Token will gradually strengthen, possibly even surpassing Ms. Alba's primary Star Token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the future, which one will be the true primary Star Token remains uncertain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne naturally wouldn&rsquo;t tell Adriana that this was the effect of the Warfare Ancient Tree, not because he didn&rsquo;t trust her, but because it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone has their own secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana only asked out of sheer surprise. Seeing that Osborne had no intention of explaining, she smoothly changed the subject, "Anyway, from now on, you are the honorary patriarch of the Fairy Moon Sect. However, keep your identity confidential for now. This time heading to Necropolis City, the Fairy Moon Sect has two spots. I will bring another deputy patriarch along with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and curiously asked, "Ms. Alba, how much do you know about Necropolis City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shook her head and replied, "Not at all! I only know it's a very mysterious place, and only the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom knows how to get there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also know that it holds great opportunities, possibly even the secret to quickly breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Of course, it's also extremely dangerous, and even the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom can't accomplish certain things alone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why Emperor Frederick invited supreme warriors from other forces to enter Necropolis City together. If his strength were strong enough, he definitely wouldn't reveal the secrets of Necropolis City to us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, there seems to be a special area in Necropolis City that only those below Empyrean Sacredness can enter. And there, the key to uncovering Necropolis City's secrets might be hidden."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only by finding that item can the secrets of Necropolis City be unlocked and its opportunities obtained."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Other than that, I don't know much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head after listening and thought, "Ms. Alba knows even less about Necropolis City than I do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This won't do!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Necropolis City is full of dangers. If she knows nothing about it, she could easily be used by Frederick or even lose her life there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered, "Ms. Alba, Necropolis City is actually where the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet rose to power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Adriana jolted. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked shocked, her eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied, "Necropolis City is where the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet rose to power. At that time, the Overpowering Dynasty ruled the Racial Convergence Planet, and the beings there suffered under oppression. Until the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet suddenly emerged, the twelve supreme warriors defeated and destroyed the Overpowering Dynasty in one fell swoop, shaping the current structure of the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Few people know why the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet were so powerful. But I do! They gained their strength in Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Necropolis City hides a huge secret!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And this secret has always been controlled by the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Their exploration and research of Necropolis City have lasted for tens of thousands of years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick's high-profile announcement to lead people into Necropolis City is likely because he has found a way to harness its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, he might quickly break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, can the Fairy Moon Sect withstand him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Adriana's eyes narrowed sharply, and her breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, she finally spoke, "Osborne, if your information is true, it means so much to me. Once Emperor Frederick breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, not only will the Fairy Moon Sect be unable to oppose him, but even the Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild will face trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems our most important task in Necropolis City this time is to stop Emperor Frederick from obtaining its power and prevent his breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Adriana's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Frederick breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, his first move will undoubtedly be to force her. If she refuses to marry Frederick, he will mercilessly kill her and destroy the Fairy Moon Sect to eliminate any threat to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly said, "Osborne, I have some important matters to handle. Stay in Nebula City, and contact me with the Star Token if anything comes up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, she was going to prepare a countermeasure. In the past, although she knew Necropolis City was full of dangers and opportunities, she hadn't paid much attention to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, after learning the true origin of Necropolis City, she naturally needed to make more preparations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was precisely why Osborne told her the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne worried that relying on his strength alone, he couldn't stop Frederick's plan in Necropolis City, nor prevent him from breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the gap in strength between him and Frederick was too great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana added, their chances of success would be much higher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even if Adriana's strength was slightly inferior to Frederick's, the gap wouldn't be too large. With Adriana's help at a critical moment, things would become much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered seriously, "However, this still isn't secure enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emperor Frederick, since he dared to bring powerful figures like Adriana into Necropolis City, must have not only intended to leverage their strength but also considered the possibility of them competing with him for opportunities. He must have made preparations..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a day passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne woke up Clara and Leroy; it was time to head to the treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><div class="pagination">
