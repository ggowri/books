Osborne greeted Sebastian with a warm smile as he entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his ascension to godhood, Sebastian appeared significantly younger, resembling a vibrant middle-aged man more than an elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's return brought a beaming smile to Sebastian's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally out of your retreat? You've been in there for quite a while; I bet you've gained a lot!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a grin. "I've ascended to Superior Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Sebastian's eyes sparkled with excitement mixed with a hint of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! That's incredible! You're advancing at an unbelievable pace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembled, not just with joy but with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian mused, "He ascended to deityhood not too long before me, and now&mdash;just a couple of months later&mdash;he's already shot past Intermediate Deity to reach Superior Deity! That's just extraordinary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Sebastian, who had witnessed so many members of the Augustine family ascend to deityhood, this was staggering. Over five hundred family members had attained that status, yet none had managed to break through to Intermediate Deity, let alone make it to Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood better than anyone how challenging it was to progress from Junior Deity to Superior Deity, even in the abundant energy environment of the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian said, pride evident in his voice, "It's fantastic, really! You've grown so much that I can hardly keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With you around, the Augustine family can truly thrive in peace. You're here to catch up on the family's happenings over the past month, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, eager to hear the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian quickly filled him in on the developments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, it's been smooth sailing for the Augustine family lately. We haven't faced any troubles at all. Over five hundred family members have crossed the threshold to godhood, and our Draco Armed Services Branch now boasts over 200 thousand members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's remarkable, especially considering our meticulous selection process; otherwise, it might have exceeded a million! You made the right call putting Bryce in charge of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's responsible, capable, and has enough talent to command respect. The strength of the Draco Armed Services Branch keeps rising every day. With the endless resources at their disposal, many members are reaching Class A or close to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, several have already broken into Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't be long before we see someone ascend to godhood from within the Draco Armed Services Branch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled widely, clearly pleased with the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Blood Demon members were indeed powerful, they felt more like his personal army. The Draco Armed Services Branch was solidifying its strength, which meant better security for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce truly is impressive!" Osborne complimented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Anastasia was the leader of the Draco Armed Services Branch and several others held vice-leader positions, Bryce was the one who truly ran the show. Osborne had complete faith in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian replied, nodding eagerly, "Absolutely! Oh, and during this time, it's been unusually quiet with Rosmandi and the neighboring countries. I can't quite figure it out, but the Beast Tide has vanished without a trace. There haven't been any attacks on our cities lately. The Dark Exotic Beasts and Dark Deities seem to have disappeared completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Sebastian's expression shifted to one of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, mirroring his unease. "Dark Exotic Beasts and Dark Deities just vanishing? That doesn't sit right with me. It screams trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian agreed, nodding gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly my thoughts. I've sent Wesson to look into it, but so far there's been no news. Now that you're out of your retreat, if you have some time, it might be a good idea for you to investigate too. I can't shake this nagging feeling; it's like the calm before a storm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a serious look crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, his expression hardening, "I'll look into it. These Dark Deities pose a greater threat to us than the Pantheon League or the Eityreia Organization. We have to wipe them out whenever we get the chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of eliminating every Dark Deity on Blue Planet was crucial; only then would he feel safe enough to leave for Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he kept that part to himself, not wanting Sebastian and the others to know he was already preparing to seek out a passage to Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded, but his demeanor shifted to one of seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Osborne and said, "Osborne, what I'm about to tell you is personal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Personal?" Osborne raised an eyebrow with his curiosity piqued, and his expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember Reginald?" Sebastian asked, his voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed. "Of course I remember him. He's one of the vice leaders of the League of Divine Descent, and he was one of the prime suspects in the abduction of my parents! Last I checked, he was locked up in our dungeon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded in acknowledgment. "I've been interrogating him for some time, trying to find out if he was behind your parents' disappearance over twenty years ago. But he's tough as nails. I haven't been able to crack him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of anticipation coursed through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Grandpa, you're saying you've finally managed to get something out of him? You have news about my parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's nod was slow but deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I've managed to pry it out of him. Your parents were indeed taken by him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that revelation, Sebastian's eyes burned with a fierce intensity, filled with the promise of vengeance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
