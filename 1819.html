  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as he absorbed the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the West Zone, the Human Community was a sprawling network of factions, but when it came down to it, there were only twenty-two top-tier powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these, two were classified as Sanctum Level Powers, while the remaining twenty were Dukedom Level Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Sanctum Level Powers were the Sanctum of Night and the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their leaders, the God of Night and the God of Light, respectively, held immense influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Night was particularly enigmatic, with a membership rumored to be fewer than a hundred. Its status as the most elite Sanctum Level Power stemmed entirely from the prowess of the God of Night, a figure comparable to Lord Malevolence&mdash;the only one capable of standing against him in a direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night was a force unto himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the God of Night had been absent for decades, and the Sanctum of Night had become exceedingly reclusive, rarely opening its doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many speculated that the God of Night had suffered severe injuries from the Shadow Terror Fiend, wounds deeper than those inflicted on Lord Malevolence, and was currently recuperating&mdash;or worse, perhaps he had already perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the body of the God of Night hadn't been found, no one dared to underestimate the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Sanctum of Night still stood, no one would risk provoking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the Sanctum of Light was vibrant and active.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the years of the God of Night's disappearance, the God of Light had become the beacon of hope for the West Zone's Human Community. She led the charge against Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion, repeatedly pushing back their advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light was, without a doubt, the ruler of the West Zone's Human Community, and the Sanctum of Light had emerged as its strongest faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Sanctum of Light remained intact, there was still hope for the Human Community in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond these two powerful sanctums, the twenty Dukedom Level Powers comprised the ten great families and ten organizations, all serving as the primary bulwark against the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the right hand of both the God of Night and the God of Light, ensuring that the Human Community of the West Zone maintained its foothold and wasn't wiped out by the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These twenty Dukedom Level Powers were exceptionally strong. While they might not match the Paramount Supreme Clan, they were no weaker than any of the tribes under Lord Malevolence's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these ten great families were the Baxter family and the Faulkner family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued to sift through Hubery's memories, a chilling discovery struck him, the Baxter and Faulkner families had betrayed the Human Community. They had thrown their lot in with Lord Malevolence, secretly feeding intelligence to the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more alarming, they were plotting to assassinate the God of Light with the help of the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their plan succeeded, the God of Light would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The West Zone's Human Community would be left leaderless, and at that point, the Baxter and Faulkner families would turn against their own, working in concert with the Paramount Supreme Clan to seize control of the West Zone with minimal resistance when the Dark Deity Legion attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the Baxter and Faulkner families were traitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They aimed to eliminate the pillar of the Human Community&mdash;the God of Light. If they succeeded, the fate of the West Zone would be sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, despite scouring through Hubery's memories, Osborne couldn't find any specific details about the Baxter and Faulkner families' plans. He only knew that they were set to act soon, but the exact timing and nature of their actions remained a mystery, even to Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baxter family! Faulkner family! You've signed your own death warrants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a storm of fury and disbelief. As two of the top Dukedom Level Powers in the West Zone Human Community, it was unthinkable that they would betray their own kind and align themselves with Lord Malevolence. Worse still, they were plotting against the only hope the Human Community had left&mdash;the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, grappling with the weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I manage to find the God of Light and warn her about the Baxter and Faulkner families' treachery, would she even believe me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't present any solid evidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both families are powerful; they might just turn the tables and pin the blame on me! How can I convince the God of Light? And how do I thwart the Baxter and Faulkner families' plans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, realizing that his current status might not even grant him access to the Sanctum of Light to speak with the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he had to admit he was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll just have to take this one step at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, it seems like the Baxter and Faulkner families' scheme isn't set to go into action just yet. I still have a chance to change the course of events. My first priority is to establish a strong foothold in the West Zone and prove my worth. Only then will I be able to gain entry to the Sanctum of Light and meet the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I need to gather evidence of the Baxter and Faulkner families' betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything else can wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne pushed aside his worries. Hubery's memories hadn't offered much in the way of actionable intelligence, so he returned to his training, focusing on honing his skills and preparing for the challenges ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed in the outside world, but aboard the Supreme Malevolence Airship, an astonishing two hundred days had gone by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the massive vessel arrived in the West Zone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
