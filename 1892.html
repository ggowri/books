  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Grandpa, I just wanted to clarify everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded, his expression serious. "That's fair enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Binding Twin Pearl works both ways. Once we're bound, if your energy signature starts to weaken, I'll know you're in trouble. I can sense it through the pearl and teleport to you immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you ever feel my energy signature fading, that means I'm in danger, too! But don't be foolish and try to teleport to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like I said, if I can't handle the threat, you showing up would just be throwing your life away! Remember, only I can use the Binding Twin Pearl to reach you. You absolutely cannot come to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you're in a dire situation and need to escape, that's a different story. Just know that using the Binding Twin Pearl to teleport takes a bit of time to guide, and for a true warrior, that time is often enough for the enemy to finish you off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have spatial power at your disposal, so when it's time to run, use that instead! The Binding Twin Pearl should only be a last resort!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation&mdash;that's his Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a Supernal Deity King, and you're still at mid-level Deity King. If you get caught in his Universe-Sealing Formation, you won't be able to use interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But with the Binding Twin Pearl, you can still teleport to me; the formation won't stop that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro finished speaking, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Universe-Sealing Formation was indeed formidable, and he had no idea how to escape if he ever fell into such a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Binding Twin Pearl, he had a backup plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, he asked, "Grandpa, you mentioned that the Universe-Sealing Formation is Trevor's Divine Ascendance Technique? What exactly is a Divine Ascendance Technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro chuckled. "I knew you'd ask that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Divine Ascendance Technique is a power only a Supernal Deity King can master! It's incredibly strong, akin to a formation&mdash;it harnesses the very forces of heaven and earth! I can't explain it all right now, but you'll understand once you become a Supernal Deity King yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just know that every Supernal Deity King has their own unique Divine Ascendance Technique! Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation isn't all that impressive; it's just good at trapping people. Once you're caught, it's tough to break free from the inside, even if you're stronger than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it has its weaknesses, it lacks raw power and can be easily breached from the outside! In short, the Universe-Sealing Formation isn't worth worrying about! You'll encounter many Divine Ascendance Techniques far superior to it in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What seemed like an insurmountable challenge to Osborne was, in Jethro's eyes, merely a minor obstacle among the vast array of techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious expression, Osborne nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's your Divine Ascendance Technique, Grandpa?" His curiosity got the better of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro smiled knowingly, saying, "Even if you hadn't asked, I'd want to share it with you! Since you're heading out on your journey, I don't have much to offer you as a parting gift, so I'll give you my Divine Ascendance Technique instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro pulled out eight tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These tokens shimmered with a smooth, polished surface, clearly crafted from the finest materials. Intricate patterns were etched all over them, radiating a unique energy that was hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro revealed the tokens, Zachary and the others stared in wide-eyed amazement, their expressions a mix of envy and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro declared, a proud smile on his face, "These are my Divine Ascendance Technique! Because of their immense power, activating a Divine Ascendance Technique usually requires a bit of time to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in the heat of battle, you often don't have that luxury!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why most Supernal Deity Kings seal their techniques in advance. Take Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation, for example&mdash;he had it sealed within those young men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moment he thinks about it, the formation activates, saving him precious time. While it won't be as powerful as if he cast it himself, it still packs a solid punch&mdash;about sixty to seventy percent of its full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The tokens I'm giving you are sealed with my Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Gale of Netherworld! Each one can unleash the Gale of Netherworld once, and when it's activated, it carries about eighty percent of my full power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for effect, his pride evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me tell you, my Gale of Netherworld is in a league of its own, far beyond Trevor's Universe-Sealing Formation! Once activated, it can summon the chilling winds of the underworld to sweep away your enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Supernal Deity King like Trevor would have to flee in the face of my Gale of Netherworld! If he hesitates for even a moment, he's as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each of you will get one of these tokens as a parting gift from me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
