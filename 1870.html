  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sighed, "So, what you're saying is, you've found your mother's family? They're one of the top ten families in Celestara's Human Community? But they don't know where your mother is? They treat you well, but they all believe it was your father who 'tricked' her away? And now, everyone hates your father?" His voice dropped as he finished speaking, followed by another sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yes, Grandpa. That's exactly how it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian thought for a moment and then stood up to say, "Let's go. No matter what, the Hudson family is your mother's family. They're her blood relatives. Even if they hate your father to the core, I need to meet them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, Grandpa. I've got a good feeling about the Hudson family. They just don't like 'Father,' but they won't take it out on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled at that, saying, "I'm not worried at all. I may not know the Hudson family personally, but I know exactly what kind of person your mother was. Any family that raised someone like her has to be a decent one. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then led Sebastian to Hudson Valley. When Osborne introduced Sebastian to Zachary and the others, their expressions froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they realized Sebastian was Osborne's grandfather&mdash;Theodore's father&mdash;their expressions turned peculiar. But eventually, Zachary took the lead, nodding respectfully as a younger family member should. "It's an honor to meet you, Sir Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne had said, no matter how much his uncles and aunts resented Theodore for "stealing" their sister away, they wouldn't take it out on anyone else. Following Zachary's lead, the others all nodded politely to Sebastian as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled and said warmly, "May I ask where your father is now? No matter what, my son Theodore was indeed in the wrong. If it weren't for him, Vivienne might not have gone missing. But it's pointless to dwell on that now. What matters most is finding them. Besides, they had Osborne together. Since you've accepted Osborne as family, then we're all family now. I'd like to meet Vivienne's father personally and apologize to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's words made Zachary and the others a little uneasy. Zachary quickly replied, "You're Osborne's grandfather, so we'll just call you Sebastian. No need to be so formal. After all, we're family now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for our father... We've already sent him the message. However, he left for the Sanctum of Light not long ago, and we haven't been able to reach him. Once he sees the message, he'll return as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that time comes, he'll personally welcome you, Sebastian. In the meantime, why don't you stay with us here? You can see the place where Vivienne grew up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded. "That's exactly what I was thinking. Thank you for hosting me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had settled in Hudson Valley under Zachary's arrangement and hadn't returned to Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that they were getting along well, Osborne felt more at ease. In fact, he was starting to feel curious about his mother's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time Osborne had glimpsed the Hudson family, he saw the Ascension Two Supernal Deity King of the Hudsons&mdash;his mother, Vivienne's father, and therefore his grandfather&mdash;Jethro Hudson. Unfortunately, Jethro had gone to the Sanctum of Light and wasn't in Hudson Valley at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also intrigued by the place his mother had grown up. So, he spent the next few days wandering around Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Hudson family who saw Osborne greeted him with warm smiles. Knowing who he was, they accepted him with genuine kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This atmosphere made Osborne feel deeply at ease. For the first time since arriving in Celestara, he felt the warmth of home. He murmured to himself, "It'd be perfect if Mom and Dad were here too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he thought of his parents, his expression grew heavy. He reflected, "They returned to Celestara over 20 years ago but never came back to Hudson Valley. Where could they have gone? Could something terrible have happened to them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his fists tightly, he thought, "No matter what, I have to keep searching. Unless I find their bodies or confirm they're gone, I won't give up. Even if I have to turn Celestara upside down, I'll find them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne returned to his room. The Hudson family had provided him and Sebastian with a villa in the heart of the valley to stay temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne soon entered his training state. He understood that his current strength wasn't enough; there were still many people in Celestara who could threaten him. He had to grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, having found his mother's family, Osborne felt an even greater sense of responsibility. The Hudsons' situation wasn't looking good recently, and that weighed heavily on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, "Mom, don't worry. Now that I've found your family and your people, I'll protect them. Anyone who dares to harm them will become my enemy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, morning came. Osborne then went to see the others and said, "Uncle, I need to head out for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary frowned at his words and asked, "You're going to deal with Kurt, aren't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
