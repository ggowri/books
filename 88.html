  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s words caused Osborne, who was eavesdropping downstairs, to suddenly reveal a murderous glint in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Justin, you&rsquo;re courting death.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In recent days, Osborne had been busy completing the Godfather&rsquo;s heir test, so he hadn&rsquo;t sought trouble with Justin yet. He didn&rsquo;t expect that Justin would actually want to hire a hitman to kill him and even get caught by him in the act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Given this, Osborne could only strike first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t rush to act. He wanted to hear more of their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Caldwell, are you overthinking this? Milo is a Class C assassin in the organization with powerful psychic gifted. The person you want to kill is just a waste, right? Could he really turn the tables on Milo?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy sneered, &ldquo;Milo must have been delayed by something. Just wait for the news. The organization has more important matters to attend to in Mayby City right now and can&rsquo;t spare the manpower.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin frowned and raised his voice. &ldquo;Mr. Jones, I paid a ten million dollars, but the person I want dead is still alive. I suspect you&rsquo;re not really trying to help me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy was getting impatient. &ldquo;Alright, alright, stop shouting. Give me the information on the person you want dead, and I&rsquo;ll arrange for someone to take care of it. Happy now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin smiled. &ldquo;The person I want dead is named Osborne.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne? Why does that name sound familiar?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy was surprised, then suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;You said Osborne? Could it be the Osborne who just joined the Radcliffe family as Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was also surprised. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of him?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy&rsquo;s expression grew serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Heard of him? This guy has messed up big plans for the organization. If it&rsquo;s him, then Milo might indeed be in trouble. Even our mole in the Radcliffe family is wary of this guy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing that, Justin grew even more anxious. &ldquo;What should I do then?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That bastard Osborne has been at my family for three years. I always thought he was a useless fool, but who knew he was hiding so deeply?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for him, I would have killed that bitch Ophelia long ago and become the Caldwell family&rsquo;s heir. Only as the Caldwell family heir can I fully support the organization. Now that Milo is in trouble, that bastard will definitely guess it&rsquo;s me and come to kill me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was getting agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy, however, smiled faintly and said, &ldquo;No need to worry. That guy might have some skills, but he won&rsquo;t live much longer. Tomorrow night, the organization has a major operation against the Radcliffe family. He&rsquo;s as good as dead. Just wait for the good news, Mr. Caldwell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really scared, stay here for a few days, and enjoy yourself. It&rsquo;s absolutely safe here. No one can harm you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Justin happily nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stay here for a few days. Once that waste Osborne is completely dead, I&rsquo;ll go back. I won&rsquo;t bother you, Mr. Jones. I&rsquo;ll just go downstairs to look around.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy nodded and had someone escort Justin downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Downstairs, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t expect to gather so much useful information from Davy and Justin&rsquo;s conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">First, Davy was indeed connected to the Aberrants, possibly as their liaison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Second, the Aberrants had a mole in the Radcliffe family, most likely Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Third, the Aberrants were likely scheming against the major families, and Justin had long sided with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fourth, and most crucially, tomorrow night, the Aberrants would launch a major operation against Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Justin come down to watch the fight by the octagon, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He swore that Justin must die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, he needed more precise information from Davy. The information he had now was mostly conjecture and wouldn&rsquo;t easily earn the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this in mind, Osborne decided to act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Using his Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he released a burst of ocular energy, enveloping a member of Maelstrom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This Maelstrom member suddenly felt his body freeze, bound by a tremendous force controlling his arm to draw his gun from its holster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, the gun swiftly aimed at Justin&rsquo;s head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next second, a gunshot echoed through the fight club. Justin&rsquo;s head exploded like a watermelon, blood splattering onto the faces of the surrounding guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin didn&rsquo;t even know what happened before he died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chaos erupted instantly in the fight club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd screamed in terror, frantically fleeing and trampling over each other. The Maelstrom member who fired the shot was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; he shouted, but no one listened. His arm, still uncontrollably, raised the gun and fired at other Maelstrom members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He fired three shots in quick succession!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, two Maelstrom members fell to the ground, hit by bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">More Maelstrom members finally reacted, quickly taking cover and returning fire. The sound of gunfire filled the fight club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was utter chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many Maelstrom members tried to regain control, but bullets from their members&rsquo; guns kept them all on edge, not daring to trust anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Osborne took advantage of the confusion to rush upstairs.</p><div class="pagination">
