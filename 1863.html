  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all my fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary Hudson, Seth's eldest brother, struck his own face repeatedly, guilt flooding his features, his eyes red and puffy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of his failure was crushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the father of Virgil, the Hudson family's brightest young talent, and the Miracle Elixir that Tristan had brought home was originally meant to heal Seth. But Seth had insisted that Zachary take it to save his son instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary had hesitated at first, but Seth had pressed him, threatening to refuse treatment and even suggesting he might take his own life right in front of him if Zachary didn't comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such desperation, Zachary had reluctantly taken the elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just used it to heal Virgil when Tristan's urgent call had pierced the air, and panic gripped him. He feared the worst&mdash;that Seth had already passed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of his brother sacrificing his own life for his son's made Zachary's heart ache with self-loathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't save either of them, and the guilt was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around him, the others stood silently, allowing Zachary to lash out at himself. There was no denying that Zachary owed Seth a debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood the gravity of the situation and shared in his sorrow, believing Seth was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan stood frozen, watching the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tristan saw Zachary's self-recrimination and the pain etched on his face, all the resentment he had felt toward Zachary and Virgil for taking the Miracle Elixir evaporated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rushed forward, grabbing Zachary's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, stop! It's not what you think! My dad is still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I called you all here not because he's dead but because of something incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing Zachary by the arm, Tristan headed straight for the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary was taken aback, confusion washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the family exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what to make of Tristan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Seth isn't dead? Then what's going on that would make Tristan so frantic?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity rippled through the group as they followed him into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they found Seth lying on the bed, flanked by Osborne and Anastasia, who had returned to their original appearances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family barely noticed them, their attention riveted on Seth. As they took in his frail state, the reality of his declining health struck them like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed forward, worry and heartbreak etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in their eyes, and some couldn't hold back their sobs, unintentionally crowding Osborne and Anastasia to the back of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the commotion, Seth's voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all doing? Step back! I'm not dead yet! Why are you crying? And hey, you're pushing Vivienne's child to the back! Move aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shout brought an immediate hush over the room, everyone turning to him in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seth, what did you just say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind from the pain? Vivienne's child? She's been missing for over twenty years! That scoundrel Theodore tricked her and disappeared. If I ever catch him, I swear I'll make him pay!" someone growled, anger and pain mingling in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the back of the crowd, Osborne felt a wave of awkwardness wash over him as he nervously rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Wait a minute... Are they saying my mother was 'tricked' away by my dad? What exactly did my dad do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And did he come to Celestara before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounds like the Hudson family has some serious grievances against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he took in the faces around him. These were the core members of the Hudson family, the main bloodline&mdash;the current heads of the family, Jethro's sons and daughters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also his mother Vivienne's siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization struck him hard. These were his relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, Seth's voice broke through the tension. "Everyone, back off! I'm not insane! Vivienne's child has returned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne's child is back! That's him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth pointed directly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all eyes turned to Osborne, shock painted across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, straightened up, and bowed respectfully. "I'm Osborne Augustine. It's a pleasure to meet you all, my uncles and aunts! My mother is Vivienne, and my dad&mdash;the one you just mentioned wanting to skin alive&mdash;is Theodore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen or so middle-aged men and women stared at Osborne, struggling to process the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Osborne's mother is Vivienne! So that means he is our nephew?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for real?" Zachary asked, disbelief etched on his face as he turned to Seth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth nodded vigorously, his expression serious. "Zachary, it's true! He is Vivienne's child!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
