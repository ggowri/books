  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could speak in the chatroom, Owen sent a message: [Osborne has abandoned all his territories. Now, his people have all retreated to Campbell. There's no one left in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> or </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. I've never seen someone so cowardly. Even though Lance held the line at </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, at least he fought the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Osborne just ran away.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's mocking comments left the chatroom silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled faintly and ignored the jabs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly replied to Matthew: [I knew I couldn't hold off the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' first wave, so I wisely pulled everyone back. But I stay behind.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chatroom quickly came alive again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew texted: [Avoiding the front lines isn't a bad strategy. If I had known the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were this strong, I would have given up on less critical territories earlier and focused on defending the headquarters to minimize losses.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sent a message: [I was too confident and lost some manpower. Had I known earlier, I would have pulled back sooner and concentrated on defending the headquarters.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent replied: [That's a good strategy, but aren't you going to defend the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>? That seems a bit much to overlook.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen texted: [He's just scared.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added: ["You've retreated everyone and stayed there alone. What are you going to do alone? This is war, a brutal war. With just your Class A+ level, what can you really do? It's laughable. You should just give up.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance typed: [Yeah, it's a brutal war. Before coming here, I was confident in my abilities. But now, as you can see, I just hope I can find a way to recapture </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen replied: [Lance, you've done well. At least you didn't run away without fighting like Osborne did. Now, he's foolishly staying behind alone. He can't do anything on his own. His score is likely already fixed.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance texted: [Osborne, we're all from branch bloodlines. I suggest you leave quickly. If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> find you, you won't even be able to escape.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew added: [Osborne, your strength is limited. Since you've abandoned </span><span>Dampston's</span><span> defense, you should leave now and avoid taking risks.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma followed: [Osborne, stay safe.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne read through the messages. His lips curled into a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly: [Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. You all keep up the good work. I'm heading out now.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne closed the chatroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already had a good sense of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength. They were indeed formidable, and their attacks on various provincial headquarters were beyond what he could currently handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had taken over Draco Group's assets and had to leave some forces behind to guard them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guards wouldn't be very strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ready to stir up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the roles have reversed. Defense is always passive. Only attack is the way to go," Osborne murmured, tearing open a dimensional rift with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped into the dimensional rift, heading for a rare metal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mining area had been taken by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> a few hours earlier, but before that, Osborne had already evacuated everyone, so there had been no casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne aimed to reclaim the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he had reached Class AA and could control spatial power far beyond his previous level. Each dimensional shift could cover over 30 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several interdimensional travels, Osborne arrived at his destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a rare metal mine controlled by the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know the exact type of rare metal, but he knew that the Draco Group placed great importance on these mines. They controlled all the rare metals in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how many enemies are still here," Osborne murmured, using his dark elemental power to blend into the shadows and cautiously enter the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no battle having erupted, everything in the mine seemed normal, except that the machines had stopped working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne soon picked up on the scent of enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, he quickly spotted a dozen or so enemy figures scattered around the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These figures were at least Class A in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't confirm whether there was any Class AA among them without taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> left only a handful of people to guard the mine? Even if there are Class AA among them, with my current strength, I don't need to worry. I can either eliminate them or easily retreat if needed." Osborne's eyes gleamed with a cold, murderous intent. "But I must act quickly. I need to strike and leave immediately, without getting entangled. Otherwise, if more </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, or even a Class AAA, show up, I might not be able to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne decided to go for a stealthy approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the dimensional space and took out a scythe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
