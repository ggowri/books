  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's expression was icy, but inside, her heart was ablaze with competitive spirit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had to win!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, Clarissa had already begun to suspect the nature of Osborne's relationship with Emma. It didn't sadden her; after all, such things were all too common in elite circles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her own father, Dylan, had more than one wife.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a world where truly capable men were constantly pursued by beautiful women, it was no surprise that they often found themselves surrounded by admirers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa had never thought of monopolizing Osborne, but now that an exceptional woman like Emma had entered the picture, the reality of competition hit her hard. It was suffocating, and it stung.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood that some things were beyond her control.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she couldn't stop the tide of women flocking to Osborne, she had to prove that she, Clarissa, was the best among them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's battle!" Clarissa murmured, her icy gaze igniting with fierce determination.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I challenge you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a young man stepped onto Clarissa's platform. Although she had easily defeated Vincent with a single strike, her rank was still only Class AA. To the onlookers, it seemed less about Clarissa's strength and more about Vincent's incompetence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, a Class AA like Clarissa appeared far more manageable than Emma, who was ranked 299th on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man's eyes sparkled with confidence. "So, I hear you're Osborne's girlfriend? He's about to hold the Honor Quest Ceremony. I might not stand a chance against him, but defeating his girlfriend would still be a nice feather in my cap."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's expression turned frosty. She had no interest in wasting words with this guy. Without hesitation, she unleashed her power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a dramatic flourish, her Divine and Demonic Wings unfurled, half divine and half sinister, transforming the already stunning Clarissa into a vision of a goddess.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's fight!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wings whipped through the air with tremendous force, crashing down on the challenger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, he was sent flying, blood spewing from his mouth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he was a Class AAA, he was no match for Clarissa, who made him look as weak as Vincent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One blow, and he was defeated!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of astonishment rippled through the crowd, who was clearly impressed by Clarissa's display of power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, even that didn't deter more challengers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, another young man stepped forward, eager to take on Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Emma interjected, "Hey everyone, we are here to see who can last longer in this showdown. If you keep challenging her like this, I'll end up winning by default, and I don't want that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, here's the deal: we'll take turns facing you. One challenge at a time!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emma beckoned the young man forward.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll challenge me first!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man hesitated, clearly torn. Emma was ranked 299th on the Godson Rankings&mdash;how could he possibly compete? But with Emma calling him out, he couldn't back down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "Alright, I accept your challenge!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, Emma had him frozen in place, swiftly defeating him with a single move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like that!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her victory, Emma turned her gaze back to Clarissa. Though she didn't issue a direct challenge, the intensity in her eyes spoke volumes, filled with the same competitive spirit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa bit her lip, ready for the next challenger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With her Divine and Demonic Wings swirling around her, she effortlessly dispatched her opponent, then cast a determined glance at Emma, their eyes locked in a silent battle of wills.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere crackled with energy as Clarissa and Emma seemed to mirror each other's moves&mdash;one strike to defeat an opponent, and then the other would follow suit. Neither was willing to back down; each was determined to prove their superiority in this fierce contest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One challenger after another stepped forward, only to be defeated in moments before the formidable duo.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd below was astounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the challenges continued, they realized that Clarissa, despite being only a Class AA, was no less formidable than Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her performance alone was worthy of a place on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My word, are we dealing with two demigods here?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the top contenders from the Godson Rankings had yet to make their appearance, and the challengers before Emma and Clarissa stood no chance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Down below, Kendra and Yulissa exchanged a glance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems they're just blowing off some steam," Yulissa whispered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendra couldn't hide the excitement in her eyes. "Blowing off some steam? No, they're fighting over a man! Osborne really has a knack for getting into these kinds of situations, doesn't he? But this kind of spectacle is exactly the kind of thing I love to watch!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa rolled her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should we tell Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendra shook her head. "What would be the point? He's in seclusion. Besides, even if he came, it wouldn't make a difference. They're both fired up and itching for a win."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The match between Clarissa and Emma continued, their victories over their challengers spreading the news of their duel far and wide.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't long before other high-ranking contenders from the Godson Rankings were itching to test their mettle against the two formidable fighters.</p><div class="pagination">
