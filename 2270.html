  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the referee announced the impending showdown between Osborne and Leroy, the crowd erupted into a frenzy of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew this match was the championship battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne emerged victorious, he would claim the title.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Leroy won, she was likely to take the championship as well, despite having to face Clara afterward&mdash;yet no one believed Clara stood a chance against Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was it&mdash;the battle for the crown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supporters from Azure Haven Academy chanted Leroy's name, their faces alight with fervent admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, fans from Mystic Sirius Sect were equally passionate, shouting Osborne's name in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face darkened as she shot a disdainful glare at the higher-ups of Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How despicable!" she hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just wrapped up a grueling battle with Marreese, unleashing a whopping thirteen Sacred Power arrows in rapid succession. It was obvious that his Sacred Power reserves were running on empty. Yet, just a few minutes later, Azure Haven Academy had thrown him back into the arena to face Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply outrageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela felt helpless. Azure Haven Academy was the defending champion of the last city duel, which was why this year's event was being held on their turf. They had full control over the match pairings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the privilege of hosting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela fumed silently.</span><br><span>"</span><span>Hmph! If Osborne wins, the next city duel will be held at the Mystic Sirius Sect! Just </span><span>you wait&mdash;then I'll show you what a real home-field advantage means and what it's like to face a worthy opponent!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Osborne step onto the stage, a pang of worry shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has his Sacred Power recovered? Not a </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Chance</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's only an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Even if he managed to get his hands on Sacred Power early on, there's no way his reserves are all that deep. When he let loose a barrage of thirteen Sacred Power arrows before, it must've drained him big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even I wouldn't be able to bounce back much in such a short span.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Osborne's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be running on fumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, how's he </span><span>gonna</span><span> go toe-to-toe with Leroy? She's got Sacred Power too and is at a higher cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Angela's view, Osborne's odds of winning this match were next to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a pity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But he's done an amazing job! Even if he loses, he's shown his mettle! Maybe I should get in touch with Ms. Alba?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the arena, Osborne and Leroy stood facing each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy had a frosty look on her face, as if the world had wronged her. "You're quite something! The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were no ordinary person. You'll be a worthy adversary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it turns out I was right! Here we are, you and me, battling for the championship. It's a pity, though, that your cultivation level is just too low&mdash;Ascension Eight? You can't possibly compete with me! The title will still belong to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe in ten years, when you've broken through to Ascension Ten, you'll be able to challenge me properly. But for now... you're just not there yet! Save yourself the embarrassment and concede. I don't want to crush your confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words ignited excitement among the audience below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Leroy is really something else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's an obvious disparity among the dark-horse contestants! I'll give Osborne credit, he's quite remarkable. But when stacked up against Leroy, he's still a greenhorn! Leroy is the top dog here. If Osborne doesn't throw in the towel, he's </span><span>gonna</span><span> get crushed and end up completely deflated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Leroy, a smile appearing on his face as he took in her taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you guys from Azure Haven Academy are all this cocky, huh? Pero said he'd put an end to my winning streak, but he couldn't even withstand one of my blows! Marreese wanted to go toe-to-toe with me, to see whose attacks were stronger, and I flattened him! Now... it's your turn, </span><span>ain't</span><span> it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me, back down? Do you really think that's </span><span>gonna</span><span> happen? If you were any good, you'd come at me straight on! But I don't think you've got what it takes," Osborne retorted, his eyes alight with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Down in the area below the arena, Pero and Marreese exchanged looks, their faces clouding over at Osborne's show of defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, though, just smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! If you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> throw in the towel, then let's get this show on the road! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> prove to you that I'm nothing like Pero or Marreese! I'll show you why I'm the star disciple of Azure Haven Academy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift flick of her wrist, a searing spear suddenly appeared in Leroy's grasp, emanating an aura of menacing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in gasps as people shot to their feet, gaping at the blazing weapon in Leroy's hand with a mix of awe and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Empyrean Sacredness warriors hadn't managed to get their hands on a Sacred Artifact, yet here was Leroy wielding one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is trouble!" Angela's face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated that Leroy would have a Sacred Artifact. With her already formidable strength bolstered by such a weapon, Osborne's chances were looking pretty slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heck, he might even get seriously hurt if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact! Leroy is actually using a weapon? Holy smokes! She didn't need a weapon to take down Tyson or Marreese!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Leroy's brought out the Sacred Artifact, this fight is basically over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excited murmurs brought a subtle smile to Leroy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the flames licking the Inferno Drake Lance, declaring, "This is the Inferno Drake Lance! A Sacred Artifact! It might be a rather ordinary one, but it's definitely not something your bow can compare to! You're the first to make me use the Inferno Drake Lance in this city duel. Being defeated by it? That's something to be proud of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Leroy swung the Inferno Drake Lance, causing flaming dragon phantoms to erupt from the spear, radiating a terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Artifacts naturally came infused with Sacred Power&mdash;a far cry from Osborne's diluted version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a wave of tension wash over him as he stared at the Inferno Drake Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder I sensed a threat from you! It's because you wield a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think a Sacred Artifact's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be enough to beat me? You're dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, a smug grin on his face, "You're getting way too cocky! Let's see just how hot your Inferno Drake Lance really burns! Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fighting spirit erupted like a volcano. Leroy was the first to stir such fierce resolve in Osborne since the city duel kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he pulled back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a Sacred Artifact, but it was still a top-notch quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he channeled his Sacred Power into it, ten menacing Sacred Power arrows materialized, homing in on Leroy like guided missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's eyes popped in surprise. "You've got some serious juice in that Sacred Power! Not bad, not bad! Maybe I did underestimate you! But that just makes this more </span><span>exciting. If you run out of steam too soon, taking you down won't be any fun! Come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy casually grasped the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance in one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear's tip aimed squarely at Osborne from a distance, as if daring him on without an ounce of trepidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne let go of the bowstring. The ten Sacred Power arrows shot off like lightning bolts, streaking towards Leroy at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The championship showdown had begun!</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
