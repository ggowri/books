  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the Paltrow family's port!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grim. If Kendra's senses were correct, the ancient ship that attacked the Alisa Ship was now hidden within the Paltrow family's port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, the force behind the Ghost Ship is actually the Paltrow family? Are they targeting the Augustine family? The Paltrow family is one of the top three oldest families in Dampston. With their wealth and influence, they certainly have the means to do something like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Clarissa, a confrontation between him and the Paltrow family's Alexander was inevitable, and he would sooner or later become an enemy of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne realized that the force behind the Ghost Ship might be the Paltrow family, instead of feeling worried, he felt a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his two enemies had suddenly become one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, whether the Paltrow family was truly behind the Ghost Ship still needed to be investigated. At this point, it was just a suspicion, so they needed to capture some of the higher-ups from the Ghost Ship to question them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But given that they were hiding in the Paltrow family's port, the Paltrow family was the prime suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, can you sense how strong those energy fluctuations are? What level of strength do they have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra hesitated for a moment before answering, "Four of them are about the same level as the five who attacked us earlier, just a bit stronger. They're on the same tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The others are similar to the ones who boarded the ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne quickly understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems my guess was right. The Ghost Ship has four Class A- metahumans. As for the dozen or so Class B+ metahumans, they're not much of a concern!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly assessed the situation, weighing their strengths and considering whether to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked over at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said flatly, "Why are you looking at me? Do you expect me to help? If I step in, what do we need you for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you before, unless you're on the brink of death or down to your last breath, I won't be stepping in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only respond with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had indeed hoped Isa might assist him. After all, with her help, the enemies in the port wouldn't pose any threat, and he could easily deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Isa refused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, "Can't I even just look at you? I'm not actually asking you to help. It's just four people in Class A-. I can handle them myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a cold laugh and didn't pay him any more attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. He finally decided to take action. Opportunities like this were rare. The Ghost Ship had suffered heavy losses this time, so they might </span><span>relocate their base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with just four opponents in Class A-, he definitely had a fighting chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had withstood an assault from five Class A- metahumans before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he hadn't even used his Illusion Projection technique back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Illusion Projection as his trump card and Isa providing backup, he was confident he could sweep through the Ghost Ship's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's resolve was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, stay close to Isa. She'll protect you. I'll be back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne descended to the water's surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stood calmly on the sea, holding Kendra's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. Don't go dying on me. If I can't save you, don't hold it against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sped off. To avoid detection by the enemies in the port, he used the power of the water element to part the sea, diving beneath the surface and slowly approaching the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kendra watched Osborne disappear, her face was full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, are you really not going to help Osborne? There are four very strong people in there. What if Osborne can't handle them? Aren't you worried about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied coolly, "What's there to worry about? If he can't overcome this challenge, I'd be very disappointed in him. You should worry more about the people inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's level might not be that high, but he has many tricks up his sleeve. If his opponents don't have overwhelming power, they'll eventually fall to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was stunned, her face full of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Isa and carefully asked, "But Osborne's all alone. Isa, aren't </span><span>you</span><span> his girlfriend? Don't you care about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said I'm his girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra blushed. "</span><span>I..</span><span> I just guessed. You two seem to have a really close relationship. Even though you argue a lot, you both seem to care about each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked surprised. "I care about him? How could that be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of curiosity crossed her eyes, and she softly asked Kendra, "Kendra, you're in your twenties, right? You must have been in love before. Can you tell me what it feels like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra exclaimed, her face turning even redder. "Um, Isa, I... I don't really know what being in love feels like. I've never been in love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've never been in love? </span><span>So</span><span> you don't know what it feels like either?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra nodded, still blushing. "I really don't know, but I think being in love means missing him, worrying about him, caring for him, understanding him, and then... not </span><span>being able to live without him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you feel any of those, it probably means you're in love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Just feeling a few of those things counts as being in love? Then does that mean I..." Isa thought.</span></p><div class="pagination">
