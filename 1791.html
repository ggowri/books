  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of seven young figures soared from different Supreme Malevolence Airships, landing gracefully on the arena floor beside Tristram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their powerful auras radiated confidence, their eyes sparkling with an intimidating brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of these seven was at least mid-stage Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading them was a square-faced man whose presence overshadowed the others, clearly at late-stage Deity King. His attire was opulent, shimmering with a divine light that marked it as a special divine artifact. Just standing there, he exuded an air of nobility that was almost palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other six looked at him with respect, their expressions filled with reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he scanned the arena, his gaze fell on Tristram, who immediately lowered his head, shame flooding his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that Mr. Caesar Eldridge?" someone whispered in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely, it's him!" Another confirmed, excitement buzzing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Eldridge is here! We've got this in the bag now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't believe Mr. Eldridge showed up! With him around, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings won't stand a chance! They're in for a serious lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Eldridge is a direct descendant of the esteemed Lord Malevolence. He was raised under his tutelage and is one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Mr. Eldridge in the mix, this final battle is a sure win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers from various races recognized the square-faced man, their faces lighting up with excitement and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar Eldridge, as he was known, was indeed a direct descendant of Lord Malevolence, his bloodline flowing with the power and talent inherited from one of the most formidable figures in history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar, one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, was considered one of the strongest among the younger generation, with a future that could very well lead him to inherit the mantle of Lord Malevolence himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he absorbed the crowd's admiration, a faint smile played on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coolly, his gaze piercing into Tristram's soul, "Tristram, you've let me down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a super talent of the Paramount Supreme Clan, you're at mid-stage Deity King level, and you can't even handle a lowly Human Community fighter at early-stage Deity King? And now you've led us to defeat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've really disappointed me. The Bowman family chose you as their heir, and frankly, I'm worried about their future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those words, Tristram's face turned a deep shade of red, embarrassment washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone else had spoken to him like that, Tristram would have fired back without hesitation, maybe even resorted to violence. But this was Caesar&mdash;he was the direct descendant of Lord Malevolence and a member of the Eldridge family, which held a royal status in the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faced with Caesar, Tristram could only bow his head in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right, Mr. Eldridge. I've tarnished the name of the Paramount Supreme Clan! I promise to work harder from now on and not bring shame to our clan again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Tristram's sudden humility, Caesar nodded, satisfied, and turned his attention to Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept over Osborne, Anastasia, Mila, and the rest, his eyes glinting with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar spoke coolly, "A bunch of lowly humans and a traitor from the Mystic Feather Clan causing such a ruckus! The younger generation of talents from various races is becoming increasingly disappointing. I was merely here to observe, but now I have to step in and show you so-called Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings the truth. The only reason you've been able to strut around is that the real talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan couldn't be bothered to deal with you. But now, your good days are over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a proud flourish, Caesar's words dripped with disdain, and the seven behind him, including Tristram, shared cold smiles as they regarded Osborne and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar continued, his voice firm, "This is the final battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't stand a chance. I'm giving you a chance to surrender. If you're willing to submit to me, I can spare your lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Considering your decent talent and the effort you've put into your training, I'm offering you the honor of becoming my personal guards. This is your last shot at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll give you ten seconds to think it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he crossed his arms, exuding an air of superiority as if it were a privilege for Osborne and the others to even consider his offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce grinned widely, unable to contain his amusement. "Is this guy for real? Did he hit his head as a kid or something? Asking us to bow down to him? To be his guards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra chimed in, laughing, "Oh, let us be your guards? You know, if you were begging us, we might consider it! We'd be as gentle as possible when we turn you down, just to spare your fragile ego."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, they all exchanged mocking glances with Caesar, their laughter ringing out across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At their words, Caesar's expression darkened instantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
