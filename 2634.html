  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After one person was eliminated, they ultimately only received the minimum reward. Seraphina looked very annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're all useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the people around her, Seraphina felt very dissatisfied, thinking, "If these people were a bit stronger and provided me with more help, how could we possibly struggle to pass the challenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she didn't dare to say such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, for the upcoming trials on the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth floors, she still needed their help. Even if they couldn't help her defeat enemies, they could provide her with extra protection, allowing her to focus entirely on offense without worrying about defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without these people, it would be hard for her to clear the levels alone. If she were surrounded and attacked, she might be defeated and eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she failed to obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket on the eighteenth floor, her father wouldn't spare her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Seraphina not only didn't dare to scold them, but she also had to comfort them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, thank you for your hard work!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and said, "Through everyone's joint efforts, we finally passed the trial on the fifteenth floor. Although we only got the minimum reward, each of us has one million battle points. That's already quite a lot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, on the upcoming sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth floors, the top rewards will increase tenfold again. If we can still clear them, we can earn at least ten million battle points, enough to exchange for a high-quality Legendary Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, everyone immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks to Princess Seraphina. Without her leading us, we wouldn't have been able to pass the fifteenth floor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Luckily, Princess Seraphina and the other princes and princesses are here. We would have struggled to even fend off these warriors' projections, let alone defeat them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for you, we would have been eliminated long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was talking loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and said, "Alright. Now is not the time for us to celebrate. Next, we still have the final three challenges. As long as we pass them, the royal family will definitely fulfill their promise of generous rewards for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, it all depends on everyone's performance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying some encouraging words, Seraphina led everyone into the sixteenth level. They spread out to search for the trial area of the sixteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina, Emiliano, and Matthew gathered together at this moment, searching in the same direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, based on the previous patterns, the trial on the sixteenth level is likely to feature projections of warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness. And there will be at least ten of them..." Emiliano said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina nodded and responded, "That might be the case. But it's fine, the sixteenth level won't stop us. It's just ten warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. The six of us already have the strength to defeat them. As long as those useless ones can protect us, it won't be hard to pass the sixteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The tougher challenges are on the seventeenth and eighteenth levels. If nothing unexpected happens, the seventeenth level will have fifty warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and the eighteenth level will definitely have a hundred."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Seraphina's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If a hundred warriors besiege us, we won't be able to hold out for long. So, those useless ones must help hold them off. Even if they all end up eliminated, as long as they buy us enough time, we will likely pass the trial of the eighteenth level..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, Osborne, Clara, and Leroy aren't in our team. Their strength is formidable, far beyond those useless ones. If they were here, things would be much easier for us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina immediately responded angrily, "Don't mention them. Even without them, we will definitely clear the eighteenth level. When I get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I will make sure to tell Father about their lack of cooperation. Father won't let them off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, he will definitely regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They only have four people, but they have to face a hundred warriors' projections. It's even harder for them to clear the level. In my opinion, they won't even pass the fourteenth level's trial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if they barely pass the fourteenth level, they definitely won't clear the fifteenth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Seraphina looked very disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket and leave the Celestial Spire, watch how I mock him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano and Matthew both nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although they're strong, it's really hard for four people to clear it. At most, they can reach the fifteenth level..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, ignore them. Let's keep searching."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina and the others continued searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her view, Osborne and the other three couldn't possibly pass the fifteenth level. However, they were already at the eighteenth level. Osborne quickly located the trial area of the eighteenth level using his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as we pass the trial here, we can obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four stepped into the beam of light. In an instant, a hundred warriors' projections appeared before them, and each warrior had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, there are a hundred warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked calm. Perhaps he had already figured out the difficulty pattern of the Celestial Spire's trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasted no time, using the Bloodwrought Bow to condense Sacred Power Arrows. As those arrows shot out, the hundred warriors opposite were instantly enveloped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the next second, Osborne couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These warriors' projections actually started cooperating. They're no longer fighting individually but seem like a unified whole. They've become tougher to deal with, but...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the face of absolute power, their cooperation is meaningless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Osborne effortlessly crushed the hundred warriors' projections using Sacred Power Arrows, helping the four swiftly clear the level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a beam of light from the Battle Points Monument enveloped the four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle points above the four's heads increased by a full ten billion once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, each of them had over 3.3 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were very happy. For Osborne, who had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, the trial of the eighteenth level was indeed effortless. With Osborne's help, they once again easily gained ten billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could exchange battle points on the eighteenth level for any treasures and resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, when they were on the ninth level, they only had over three million battle points and couldn't exchange for anything good, but now it's completely different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each received 3.3 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifact only costs 100 million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They can use their battle points to exchange for dozens of Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they convert their battle points into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, that's 330 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey all felt extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are about to get rich.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, compared to exchanging battle points for resources and treasures, the more important thing is obtaining the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, where is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and replied, "I don't know either. But since Emperor Frederick said we just need to pass the eighteenth level to get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, we will definitely obtain it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can use battle points to exchange for some items first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, if you don't want to exchange for anything else, you can trade for some Perfect Dragon Elixir. That will make you stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir is worth one billion battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne pressed the Battle Points Monument, and he was immediately enveloped in red light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne met the Celestial Spire's guardian, Toby, once again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
