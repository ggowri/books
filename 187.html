  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Originally, I wanted to pretend that I didn't know! Osborne, since you want to hide your identity, you must have your reasons. I won't expose you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your 10-billion-dollar gamble with Apollo is really too risky! I'm worried about you, so I couldn't help it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an apology in Clarissa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her in amazement, completely stunned by her intelligence. He thought, "I hid it so well. But Clarissa found so many flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by guessing, Clarissa concludes that I am the new boss of Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is so beautiful, has extraordinary talent, and is actually so smart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God loves her too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, knowing that he could no longer hide it, nodded and smiled helplessly, "Clarissa, you are right. I am indeed the new boss of Skyefall Security! My elder gave Skyefall Security to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your elder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was surprised. "Then your elder is really something! To buy Skyefall Security and give it to you, sufficient money isn't enough. He must have a good relationship with the Draco Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose at Clarissa's words, knowing that she had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't explain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Clarissa knew that the Godfather, the owner of the Draco Group, was his biological grandfather and that Skyefall Security was given to him by the Godfather, she would probably be terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "My elder does have a good relationship with the Draco Group, but my relationship with him is ordinary. He just gave me Skyefall Security but would not provide me with any other help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled, "That's enough! With such a background, who would dare to look down on you? So Osborne, do you dare to marry me? Do you dare to bear the fate with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned and stared at Clarissa blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded vigorously. "Osborne, I am serious now! I don't want to regret it in the future. I want to fight. I want to control my fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I may not be in love with you yet, I'm sure that I don't hate being with you! So, will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was tension in Clarissa's eyes now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, thinking, "Since Clarissa said so, what reason do I have to back off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was because he liked Clarissa or because of Godfather's successor test, he could not possibly reject Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's sudden "confession" significantly reduced the difficulty of him completing the successor test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "Clarissa, thank you for believing in me! Being able to marry a girl like you is something I dare not even dream of. So I am willing to marry you, and I am also willing to bear the fate with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Osborne reached out and held Clarissa's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trembled, and her pretty face turned red. But she did not break free from Osborne's hand. She just tenderly looked at Osborne with her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was delighted at this moment. She bit her lip and suddenly took a step forward, standing on tiptoes and kissing Osborne on the face quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He felt the cold touch on his cheek and stared at Clarissa blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Clarissa kissed me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said shyly, "Osborne, thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I'm your girlfriend! Let's bear the fate together, okay? I know we will face many obstacles and difficulties, and it will make you face countless dangers and may even die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I swear, I will never let you fight alone! I will stand firmly with you! If we lose to fate in the end and I can't marry you, I will die with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said it very seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Clarissa's pretty face in a daze, listening to her firm words and deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is Clarissa my girlfriend now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything seems like a dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought of many ways to pursue Clarissa. Because that was his succession test, he had to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had never expected that it would be Clarissa who would take the initiative to confess to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything went so smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Clarissa, her beautiful face, and her shy expression, and couldn't help but feel his heart beating faster. He was incredibly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating for a moment, he suddenly stared at Clarissa's red lips and slowly leaned over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was stunned, knowing what Osborne was going to do. She hesitated for a moment, but she did not dodge. Instead, she breathed more quickly. She raised her chin slightly, closing her eyes and offering her red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lips were about to touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an angry shout broke the atmosphere between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa fled away from Osborne like a frightened rabbit. She was flushed as she looked at the person who spoke.</span></p><div class="pagination">
