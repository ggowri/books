  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face transformed, with a fierce determination replacing her fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had sent her location to Osborne, deep down, she really just hoped he wouldn't rush off to the Bowman family and endanger himself for her; she didn't truly believe he could save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wasn't about to wait for death to come knocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was a prodigy of the Gellar family, proud and unyielding. Even if the odds were stacked against her, fear wouldn't take hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would fight back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, once Osborne received Hannah's location, a wave of relief washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a mining area near Wild Flame City</span><span>, </span><span>an area he knew well, the very place where he had first awoken, saved by Harry and his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and his sister had worked there as a miner long before Osborne showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whispered, realization dawning, "So it's here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine base is millions of miles from Wild Flame City! Even with the fastest Supreme Malevolence Airship, it would take hours to get there! And a Deity King warrior flying at full speed would still need the same amount of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah's in a dire situation; she can't hold out for that long! Others might be too slow to save her, but not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's companions had been anxiously watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on?" Anastasia asked, with concern etching her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My friend is in danger. She's surrounded by warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan</span><span>, </span><span>the most powerful clan in Celestara. I have to get to her immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have time to explain in detail; you all need to head back to Hope Haven! I'm going to move as fast as I can to save her before it's too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare yourselves for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished, excitement and determination glimmered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood the significance of the Paramount Supreme Clan, and the thrill of confronting warriors from such a clan sparked a fire within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they headed straight to Hope Haven, ready to face whatever was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and set off immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence in saving Hannah stemmed from his mastery of spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's space elemental essence had reached Level Seven, giving him an unprecedented ability to manipulate spatial energy. Every instance of interdimensional travel now allowed him to cover vast distances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was at Divine Peak Nine, his power was suppressed, and he could only travel about 600 miles at a time. But outside the confines of that place, he could traverse with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each journey could cross 600 thousand miles in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Wild Flame City being less than six million miles away, Osborne knew he could reach Hannah with just a few well-timed travels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the farther he traveled in one jump, the more divine power it consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crossing six million miles took a significant toll, but he didn't have time to worry about that. Osborne stepped into the dimensional portal, and a moment later, he found himself 600 thousand miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne repeated this process several times, each jump bringing him closer until he materialized deep within the mining area where Hannah had said she was hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he emerged from the tear in space, he couldn't shake the feeling that Hannah had not deceived him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was charged with the fervor of battle; he hadn't even activated Satan's Eye yet, but he could already see a figure rushing toward him at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah?" he murmured, unable to believe the sudden twist of fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that instant, Hannah skidded to a halt, her eyes wide with disbelief as she saw Osborne standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was stunned, too. She stood still as she rubbed her eyes. Certainly, she must be imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really hurt that badly? Is this a hallucination? Am I about to die, and is the last thing I see the person I want most to be with?" Hannah murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at her words. Yes, Hannah bore several wounds, but they weren't too severe. Just seeing her alive filled him with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made it in time after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Hannah blinked</span><span> and</span><span> notic</span><span>ed</span><span> his smile. She rubbed her eyes again, questioning her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally spoke, his tone reassuring, "Hannah, this isn't a hallucination! I told you I could save you! I'm here now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, her expression suddenly shifting to one of suspicion, "Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you really? Osborne is far away; it hasn't been long enough for him to reach me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're trying to fool me by pretending to be him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes, about to retort, when his attention snapped to something behind Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful figures rushed toward them, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, there's nowhere for you to run! You've hidden well! Everyone thought you were a natural-born cripple, a blind girl, but look at you! You are actually the Gellar family's greatest prodigy, managing to break through our encirclement! Too bad</span><span>, </span><span>it's still not enough to save you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
