  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda approached Osborne, her gaze drawn to the Bloodwrought Bow gripped tightly in his hands, its eerie crimson glow captivating her. A sense of admiration mixed with envy washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel an undeniable threat radiating from the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, although she had been defeated by Osborne, he had only managed to breach her Luminous Elven Wings' defenses when wielding the Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Alfreda sensed a palpable danger emanating from a mere divine artifact placed in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of boost are we talking about?" Alfreda couldn't help but ask, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle smile, Osborne replied, "Almost ten times as powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Alfreda's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight pieces of Azure Ore had amplified the Bloodwrought Bow's power by tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her envy flared, and a hint of frustration crept into her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out her Arcane Staff of Nature, clenched her jaw, and said, "No way! I want Azure Ore too! My staff is an Apex divine artifact&mdash;its previous power was definitely greater than your Bloodwrought Bow. But now? I feel like your bow has surpassed </span><span>it</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to make my staff stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Perfect timing! I could use more Azure Ore myself. Let's head into the Corrosive Marsh and hunt for some Mud Golems to snag what we need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand, summoning a swarm of Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred fifty-six clones appeared around him, standing ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spread out and search for Mud Golems! Bring back Azure Ore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, two hundred and fifty-six Spatial Clones dispersed and headed in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda watched in awe, struck dumb by the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clones? You have so many! Are you really sending them to fight Mud Golems? Can they handle it? Can they really collect Azure Ore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently. "They should be alright.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Spatial Clones have around sixty to seventy percent of my attacking power, but their defenses aren't as strong. Mud Golems are slow, so they won't be much of a threat.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can definitely take down the Mud Golems and fetch us Azure Ore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, looking at Alfreda, Osborne added with a grin, "Since you're my little sidekick, I won't shortchange you! Whatever Azure Ore my clones gather, I'll give you ten percent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to him, an impish glint in her gaze as she hooked her arm around his. "Ten percent? Come on, that's hardly fair! How about we split it fifty-fifty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her an amused glare. "You want to split it equally when you're not lifting a finger? Not happening! Ten percent is already generous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not bothering to acknowledge Alfreda's playful pestering, Osborne reached into his Dimensional Bag and handed it over to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "My Spatial Clones also found some Element Gold Crystals in the Death Chasm! Given your situation, I'll toss you ten percent of those too.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, I'm going to study that pale golden crystal. You go off and practice on your own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne ignored Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you're being stingy! Just ten percent for your little sidekick? That's not how a boss rolls!" Alfreda said as she accepted the Dimensional Bag, her lips forming a playful pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alfreda opened the bag, her expression quickly shifted from bemused to astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes nearly popped out of her head as she gazed at the sheer volume of Element Gold Crystals packed inside the bag&mdash;all organized and shimmering brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hundred Element Gold Crystals?! And they're all the plant elemental kind I need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of incredulity washed over Alfreda's face as she turned to Osborne, unable to comprehend the treasure he had casually handed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Element Gold Crystal was worth more than an average Apex divine artifact, possibly even more. As a princess of the Nature Elf Clan's Royal Family, Alfreda had never laid eyes on such a substantial collection of Element Gold Crystals in her life&mdash;not even a fraction of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even her father likely hadn't encountered this many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here was Osborne, casually handing her three hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what he said, these three hundred crystals were just one-tenth of all the Element Gold Crystals his Spatial Clones had harvested in the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, that meant his clones must have collected a staggering three thousand Element Gold Crystals in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda inhaled sharply, her heart swelling with gratitude and emotion as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was more generous than anyone she had ever known!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hundred Element Gold Crystals were just given away without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, Osborne could have kept every single one of those crystals to himself, and Alfreda wouldn't have batted an eye. After all, these Element Gold Crystals had nothing to do with her; she hadn't lifted a finger to earn them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't mentioned it, she would never have known he had such a trove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, deciding to give her three hundred Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, his actions showed tremendous trust in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If word got out that Osborne had three thousand of those crystals, the entire Elf City would erupt into chaos, with everyone clamoring to hunt him down and seize his treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he chose to confide in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip, her voice wavering with emotion as she expressed her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you! I promise I won't say a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, waving his hand dismissively. "Don't bother me right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled out a pale golden crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What is this? There's no record of it in the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings! The closest match I see is the Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal is said to be a treasure of the universe, formed in the chaos before the cosmos itself came into being and scattered across the universe in the aftermath of the Big Bang. And it's incredibly rare.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Even Prince Chuck doesn</span><span>'t know what it is for. In fact, even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior would fight tooth and nail for a piece of Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne examined the pale golden crystal again&mdash;it bore a resemblance to the Cosmic Chaos Gold Crystal but contained minuscule energy far beneath what its name implied. So, it couldn't possibly qualify as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to ponder as he flipped through the Compendium, trawling for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a thorough review&mdash;three times, no less&mdash;he grew frustrated at not finding an exact match and decided to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever this is, if it can catch the interest of Satan's Eye, it has to be valuable. I'll name you... Radiant Golden Ore! Maybe this Radiant Golden Ore can truly enhance my Satan's Eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving on this Umbra Earth continent, Osborne felt his Satan's Eye was heavily suppressed, depriving him of its full advantages. If it could become even more powerful, retrieving treasures here would be a breeze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he decided to give it a go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I even use this Radiant Golden Ore, though?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the Radiant Golden Ore against his Satan's Eye, but to his dismay, it triggered no reaction. The Satan's Eye pulsed excitedly, but it couldn't absorb the energy contained within the ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I need to break down the energy within the Radiant Golden Ore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of inspiration, Osborne tried to wrap the Radiant Golden Ore in Sacred Power, attempting to dissolve its energy just as he had done with the Azure Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a massive eye-figure materialized before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the Infinite Devouring Eyes had emerged on its own, without any control from him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
