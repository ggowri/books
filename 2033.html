  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six and his companions found themselves within the Eclipse Realm, but they weren't overly panicked. They were well-acquainted with this realm and knew it lacked any real offensive power; it merely dulled their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even had methods to recover most of their awareness while inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they felt no fear&mdash;at least, not until their cultivation levels were suddenly suppressed to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they quickly realized they could regain some of their strength, it was far from complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Seven and Icy Eight, both Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, only managed to restore their levels to Ascension Three, unable to push further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six, being an Ascension Six, had a bit more leeway. He managed to elevate himself back to Ascension Five, but the stark reality remained&mdash;being reduced from Ascension Six to Ascension Five was a significant blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference of just one level could feel like a chasm in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what kind of trick is this? How can our cultivation levels be suppressed like this?" Icy Six's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Icy Seven and Icy Eight were visibly sweating, their faces pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cultivation levels had dropped to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they knew all too well that each of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, despite being only Ascension One, possessed the combat prowess of Ascension Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, in particular, wielded the strength of Ascension Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant they were at a severe disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They no longer had the upper hand in cultivation levels or strength, and their lives were now in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six urged, sensing their rising panic, "Stay calm! Don't lose your heads! I still have the strength of Ascension Five! Sure, I'm weaker than at my peak, but it's more than enough to handle the Seven Young Deity Kings! At the very least, I can protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this technique of suppressing cultivation levels can't last forever. Once it wears off, they'll be the ones in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words brought a measure of calm to Icy Seven and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold laugh echoed through the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared before them, flanked by Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waiting for the suppression to fade? Too bad you won't make it that far! Icy Six, with only Ascension Five left in you... you won't be able to keep them safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's expression turned icy. "Oh, really? Osborne, you're far too arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare show your face to me? Even at Ascension Five, I could wipe out you Seven Young Deity Kings with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Six exploded forward with terrifying speed, charging straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that with Osborne's cultivation level at Ascension One, he would only be able to muster the strength of a typical Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power between them was enormous, and he felt absolutely confident he could take Osborne down swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a </span><span>confident</span><span> grin, he unleashed a powerful punch aimed squarely at Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as he met the attack with a punch of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact reverberated through the air, sending shockwaves around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne staggered back, his face paling as a trickle of blood escaped the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that direct confrontation, he was clearly outmatched by Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at that moment, a smile crept onto Osborne's face, while Icy Six's expression morphed into one of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Five is indeed quite powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can handle it!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! You actually broke through your cultivation level? You've reached Ascension Two? And you took my hit head-on? Just a little scratch?!" Icy Six's face twisted with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who had once been at Ascension One, now exhibited strength comparable to Ascension Four. With his recent breakthrough to Ascension Two, he seemed to possess the combat prowess of someone at Ascension Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six realized that while he had an advantage, quickly defeating Osborne&mdash;or worse, killing him&mdash;was no longer a given.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about Icy Seven and Icy Eight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne declared, "I told you! With only Ascension Five left in you, you won't be able to protect them! And don't think you'll walk away from this either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow, and a shimmering Bloodwrought Armor enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow and Armor were higher-tier Apex divine artifacts, surpassing the Supreme and Ultimate divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In some ways, they were on par with the Sanctum of Light and Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now clad in the Bloodwrought Armor and gripping the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne radiated confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy gaze shifted to Anastasia and the others behind him. "Icy Seven and Icy Eight are yours to handle! They may be suppressed to Ascension Three, but they're not your average Ascension Three! Work together and find a way to take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and her companions, filled with determination, donned their Rainbow Armor and Dominion Battle Suits, each wielding their own Apex divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven of them charged at Icy Seven and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Icy Seven and Icy Eight, but they forced themselves to stay composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of kids think they can take us down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we're suppressed to Ascension Three, we're not some Ascension One rookies you can just brush aside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it, and we'll be happy to oblige! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Icy Seven and Icy Eight were at Ascension Three, they were far from ordinary; their strength exceeded that of typical Ascension Four fighters. Even with Anastasia and her team working together, defeating them wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash was intense and chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, had no time to spare on their skirmish. His focus was locked on Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was Icy Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's settle this! By the end of today, the Paramount Supreme Clan's Nine Dark Sovereigns will be down to five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill us? In your dreams! Even if I can't take you down, you won't lay a finger on me! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Six launched an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to underestimate him; Icy Six was the strongest opponent he had faced so far. With Icy Six's cultivation level still three ranks above his, Osborne had no room for complacency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To win against Icy Six, he had to give it everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he unleashed his Spatial Clone technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over a hundred Spatial Clones materialized around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spatial Clone technique had reached Level Eight, allowing him to create up to 256 at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred of those clones had been out in deep space searching for treasures, leaving him with 156 ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clone possessed about seventy percent of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a terrifying force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's expression hardened as he realized the implications, but Osborne didn't give him a chance to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled back the string of the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's end this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
