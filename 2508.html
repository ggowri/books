  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne certainly didn't care about Layne's life or death, but at the very least, he needed to ask Layne about the Frenetic Storm Warband first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Layne died, all clues would be lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew Blossom Cage was strange, and the boss behind the scenes was a powerful demonic cultivator. Since he lacked the strength, the best option was to leave here quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether pretending not to know for now, waiting until he became stronger to deal with this demonic cultivator, or directly contacting Adriana to handle them, all were better options than risking saving Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he did that, Layne would surely die and become a puppet of that demonic cultivator. It would then be nearly impossible to get any information from Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne decided to take the risk and save Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how to save him, that's the question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Layne can only hold on for at most half an hour. If nothing unexpected happens within that time, Layne will undoubtedly die. Going directly to save Layne might not be a good idea. There's a powerful defensive barrier outside Blossom Cage, and even with my spatial power, I can't pass through it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "If something goes wrong, I'll be trapped to death in Blossom Cage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, I wouldn't even need the mastermind behind Blossom Cage to show up; I wouldn't even be able to handle Romina, an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, there's also a defensive barrier outside Layne's courtyard, capable of withstanding the full-force attack of an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior. Even if I go all out now, I might not be able to break through that barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly thought of a solution. Primordial was also helping Osborne figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, if you really want to save Layne, there might be someone who can help you," Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne curiously asked, "Who are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course, it's Drum. Right now, only Drum can approach quietly. After all, Drum is still in her juvenile stage; as long as she doesn't want to be seen, no one can see her or harm her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, no defense shield can stop Drum. Drum can come and go as she pleases."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "Drum?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned and said, "You're right, Drum does have that ability. No one can actively detect Drum, and no defense shield can stop her. But Drum is in her juvenile stage and has no means of attack. How can she save Layne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "It's simple. Let Drum go to Layne's courtyard, make some noise, and stop that demonic cultivator from continuing to absorb Layne's vital essence, soul power, and potential. Then, let Drum tell Layne the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as Layne isn't foolish, he'll definitely notice something's wrong. By then, he'll figure out a way to leave Blossom Cage on his own. And once he leaves Blossom Cage, everything will be easier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Great idea! But what if Blossom Cage refuses to let Layne leave?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They won't," Primordial said. "At least on the surface, Blossom Cage runs a legitimate business and shouldn't stop guests from leaving. Otherwise, if guests cause a scene, Blossom Cage's business will be affected, and that demonic cultivator won't have an endless supply of 'prey' to absorb."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, your concern can't be ruled out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, that demonic cultivator has already targeted Layne. If Layne leaves alive, it could easily expose his methods. So, it's also possible he might forcibly keep Layne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that point, we'll have to think of another way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make a decision quickly! Layne can't hold on much longer," Primordial said, forcing Osborne to stop hesitating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Then I'll follow Primordial's plan and take it step by step."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne called Drum out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum stood on Osborne's other shoulder, listening curiously as he finished explaining the plan. She instantly became extremely excited, as if she had stumbled upon something fun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't worry, I'll definitely help you get this done. But since Drum helped you, you have to spend more time with me in the future!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, nodded, and patted Drum's head. "Alright! I promise you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already gotten used to Drum's eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, horn, and sharp mandibles. Sometimes, he even found her somewhat cute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, be careful," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded. "Don't worry, Dad. No one can hurt me now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Drum flew out directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defensive shield outside the courtyard seemed nonexistent in front of Drum. More precisely, Drum in this state seemed as if she didn't exist in the real world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things in the real world naturally couldn't stop her. Unless she was willing, she wouldn't appear in the real world&mdash;truly miraculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, watching Drum's movements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum kept flying toward the deepest part of Blossom Cage. Along the way, she encountered many people from Blossom Cage, but they couldn't see her or sense her presence. They just passed by Drum without any reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief. "Next, it depends on whether Drum can make a move to stop Layne from being drained of vital essence and soul power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum quickly arrived outside Layne's small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she effortlessly passed through the protective shield and entered the courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The courtyard was filled with a pink glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This pink light can easily make people break out the most primitive desire, and sink in the desire, unless it is a person with extremely strong willpower, or a person with extremely powerful soul power, otherwise it is impossible to maintain calm consciousness in this pink light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone entering the courtyard at this moment would be affected by the pink glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Drum was not among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These pink glows had no effect on Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pink glow emanated from a lantern, which was also suffused with the aura of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne's attention was entirely on Layne, completely ignoring the lantern. Upon closer inspection now, he realized that this seemingly ancient lantern was actually a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed. This lantern seemed to be a Superior Sacred Artifact, or even a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Good stuff!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, no need to cause any more commotion. Just take that lantern away. Once the pink glow is gone from the courtyard, Layne won't be affected and will regain clarity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum regarded Osborne as a father, forming a special connection with him, so even from a great distance, Osborne could easily communicate with Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum immediately looked at the lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she flew over, touched the lantern with her proboscis, and the next second, the lantern disappeared from its spot, taken into her Dimensional Microcosm by Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the pink glow in the courtyard vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne, who was pressing down on that beautiful woman on the bed, suddenly trembled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His confused eyes instantly became clear. "What happened to me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
