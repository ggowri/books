  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick instructed everyone to form teams of ten to prevent Osborne from finding an opportunity to attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, if he were surrounded by ten Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, it would still be very dangerous. As long as he is held up for a while, once Frederick arrives, it won't be so easy for Osborne to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he gave up taking further action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, he already gained quite a lot this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He killed two Royal Family Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors and captured Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This reduced Frederick's Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors by three, leaving only twenty-nine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And with Quinn, Osborne also had Naomi under control in Elf City and Hendrix controlled in the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So their side now had twenty-five Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty-nine versus twenty-five was not much of a difference.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was full of confidence for the final battle ahead. Once the fight began, he could use the Apocalypse Bow to directly take out one or two enemies!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the finest descendants of the Royal Family&mdash;Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix&mdash;had all been captured and controlled by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne returned to the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect and immediately released them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi and Quinn were severely injured at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne had Drum control Quinn, he used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal all their injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix stood respectfully before Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were no longer themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, their Soul Current Ocean had been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites, and their consciousness was suppressed. It was the Soulbane Parasites truly controlling their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Soulbane Parasites also devoured their memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne decided to question them, hoping to uncover some secrets from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were the Royal Family's finest princes or princesses and surely knew many secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne coldly asked, "Tell me, why did you target me and my mother back then? Who exactly gave you the orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four of them exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Weston replied, "Master, it was my mother, Queen Callista, who gave the orders! She didn&rsquo;t want you to live too comfortably in the Royal Family, so she had people target you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naomi, Quinn, and Hendrix all nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, this was the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked again, "Did you know that in my previous life, I wasn&rsquo;t actually Emperor Frederick&rsquo;s biological son? He said my mother betrayed him. Is this true or false?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master, we don&rsquo;t know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne asked the four of them many questions, but they didn&rsquo;t know much and couldn&rsquo;t determine whether what Frederick had said before was true or false.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still felt that it must be false!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like the only ones who know the truth are Emperor Frederick and Queen Callista! Once I kill them and search their memories, I&rsquo;ll uncover the truth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally asked, "My mother had a necklace with a pattern of a purple exotic flower. Have you seen it? This necklace was stored in the Royal Treasury for some time, but it was later taken away!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know who has it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had never forgotten Michelle's three relics. He still hadn't found the most important necklace. At this moment, he hoped to get a clue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix exchanged glances again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, it was still Weston who answered, "Master, the necklace you mentioned, does it also have patterns of dragons, phoenixes, and other designs besides the purple exotic flower?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt excited and exclaimed, "Yes! Have you seen that necklace?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston shook his head. "No! But I heard my mother, Queen Callista, mention it! She said the necklace was buried in your mother's tomb, but when she led people to dig it up, they found nothing! Your mother's body and the necklace were both gone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Was that necklace buried together with my mother's body in the tomb? Did they disappear together?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the necklace was taken by someone from the Royal Family, Osborne could find a way to retrieve it. But if it disappeared along with Michelle's body, recovering it would be much more troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he still had no idea how her body disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, waved his hand, and said, "Alright! You may leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began to think alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wanted to uncover Michelle's secret, he could only rely on Callista and Frederick. After all, no one else knew anything about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'll figure out what's going on very soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emperor Frederick, Queen Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze turned terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a loud bang echoed. Then Osborne felt the ground shake, and the entire secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect trembled violently, as if it were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disciples and Elders of the Fairy Moon Sect rushed out instantly, filled with panic and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye and looked up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick has finally come! In that case, I'll settle the score with him once and for all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He squinted his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana, May, Brittany, Isa, and the others appeared, their expressions extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has Emperor Frederick found us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Let's go! This battle is inevitable. Let's go out and talk to them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he took the lead and walked out of the secret base.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Protective Barrier outside, without the warriors of Fairy Moon Sect, was under attack by Frederick and his subordinates. It was already struggling and about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, Adriana, and the others come out, Frederick immediately became excited and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba! Osborne, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We meet again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you, I will hunt you down to the end. No matter where you hide, I will find you and kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, you won't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana snorted coldly, "Emperor Frederick, don't be so arrogant! You want to kill us? Then you'd better have the strength to do so!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she unleashed a powerful force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was momentarily stunned. Then, narrowing his eyes, he said coldly, "I didn't expect you to reach this level too! You've also touched the bottleneck of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness and could break through at any moment, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You truly are my greatest threat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fortunately, you have no chance to break through! Even if you reach the same level as me, so what? Today, all of you will still die! None of you will escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the people of Fairy Moon Sect are still too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors are only three in total. Even with Osborne, that's just four! How can you compare to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick looked utterly proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside him were nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, filling him with immense confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, none of you should think about escaping!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether it's you or that bastard Osborne, you're all going to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick threw another punch, shattering the defensive shield of the secret base with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He revealed a sinister smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't let a single one escape!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
