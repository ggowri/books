  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Those with earth elemental power are indeed working as 'miners' at Divine Peak Nine! But these miners are far from ordinary; they hold immense value, often ranking higher than most soldiers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The protection tasks mostly revolve around safeguarding them, as the rocks surrounding Divine Peak Nine are shielded by a unique layer of energy. Even a Deity Overlord-level warrior would struggle to break through. Only those wielding earth elemental power can slowly carve out tunnels to extract Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each miner is typically protected by a team of at least ten, with some receiving protection from squads of a thousand, depending on the danger level of their mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer you get to Divine Peak Nine, the tougher the mining becomes, but the rewards&mdash;like Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;are greater, albeit riskier...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mining areas are classified into five levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level One mining area is the farthest from Divine Peak Nine and the safest. In contrast, the Level Five area lies directly beneath Divine Peak Nine and is the most perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, protection tasks are the safest option! At least, they're much safer compared to patrol and exploration tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we're new here and still getting our bearings, our assignments won't be particularly dangerous or challenging at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, they'll only assign us protection tasks! Given Athena's disdain for me, she'll likely throw the most dangerous protection task my way! Maybe she'll send me to the Level Five mining area!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Osborne frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working in the Level Five mining area would be just as dangerous as some patrol tasks! Encounters with powerful </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were common there, and it was located far from the base, making it difficult for reinforcements to arrive quickly or for him to escape back to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll just take it one step at a time!" he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to think, "Patrol tasks involve staying close to Divine Peak Nine, circling around it to keep watch for any sudden appearances of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> legions. Besides the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, there are often other dangerous entities that fly out from Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The goal of patrol duties is to remain vigilant about everything related to Divine Peak </span><span>Nine; any anomalies must be reported immediately! The danger lies in the fact that anything emerging from Divine Peak Nine is incredibly powerful; if you spot them, it might be too late to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I won't have to deal with patrol duties for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared to protection and patrol tasks, the real danger lies in exploration missions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These require venturing into Divine Peak Nine itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Peak Nine has existed for hundreds of years, yet the various factions know less than one percent about it! When it comes to the depths of Divine Peak Nine, they are completely in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, they frequently send teams to explore, mostly around the periphery, but it's still incredibly hazardous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of every ten exploration teams that go in, at least eight won't return!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two will suffer heavy casualties! In short, being assigned an exploration task is akin to signing your own death warrant. Out of a hundred people, it's unlikely even one will make it back alive..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those exploration missions are downright terrifying! Thankfully, I don't have to worry about them for now! But who knows what will happen in two weeks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In two weeks, Athena will definitely find a way to shove me into an exploration team, sending me into the depths of Divine Peak Nine, trying to get me killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, pushing the thought of the future aside for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a decent grasp of the situation around Divine Peak Nine! It's not what I expected at all. I thought I'd be facing off against the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> legions head-on. If I could take out a Deity King-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, I'd get my hands on some death scent liquid, which would fully restore my Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! But now, my plans have fallen through. I'll have to dig in here and wait for a better opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne finished his thoughts, his wrist terminal vibrated unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew this was Athena assigning him a task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne opened the terminal to see what awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he read the details, a cold smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Mr. Augustine, your task for today is to protect miners Diana Barrymore and Emmett Huntington. The mission location is the 53rd mining area. Please proceed immediately to the eastern gate of the base to meet with other team members."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Athena really did give me the most dangerous task! The 53rd mining area is the third most hazardous zone in the Level Five mining area! And she expects me to go alone, without even a team to back me up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muttering under his breath, he realized there was no way to refuse the assignment once it was given. With a determined stride, he made his way toward the eastern gate of the base.</span></p><div class="pagination">
