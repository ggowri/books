  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly checked the Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, what's going on?" Clarissa asked, worry clear in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shook his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, I need to get back to the Augustine Estate right away. There's something urgent I need to deal with. You're not far from there, so just call me if anything happens, and I'll come straight over."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay! Go ahead and handle what you need to."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying his goodbyes, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the Augustine Estate in Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Challenge Peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The imposing peak, formed from colossal meteorites, loomed dark and menacing. Many members of the Augustine family were hurriedly making their way inside, their anxiety clear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Osborne!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Our top heir is here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne, the Augustine family members cheered, and soon, an elderly figure appeared beside him. It was the third elder, Caleb.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb visibly relaxed upon seeing Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's undercover mission to Tethynia had been Caleb's suggestion, and he had been on edge for the entire two weeks Osborne was away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that Osborne had returned safely and broke through Class AAA, Caleb couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's good to have you back, Osborne."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded and immediately asked, "Caleb, what's happened? Why are Yulissa and Kendra missing?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was a mask of concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had just received the alarming news that Yulissa and Kendra had disappeared from the Augustine family's arena, but the details were still sketchy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's expression grew serious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is quite a story."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Caleb, I need the full truth!" Osborne's voice was firm, his gaze unwavering.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb stiffened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given Osborne's current strength, Caleb knew he was outmatched. The sternness and intensity in Osborne's demeanor made Caleb nervous.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb sighed heavily. "Alright, let me explain from the beginning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It all started with the heir selection at the Augustine family. You were the one who emerged victorious, defeating everyone else. As you know, Vincent was the top contender among the younger generation. However, he was injured during the selection and had to withdraw.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the time he recovered, the selection was over. He's been holding a grudge ever since, believing that if he hadn't been sidelined and if you hadn't had Clarissa's help, he would've claimed the top spot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even after Emma defeated him, Vincent still resents you. He pretends otherwise in public, but he's seething inside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While you were away, Vincent's faction began regularly provoking Dampston. At first, Dampston tried to stay composed and ignored them. But as Vincent's provocations became increasingly harsh and offensive, Yulissa couldn't take it anymore and started fighting back.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The situation got out of hand, and despite my attempts to intervene and get Vincent to rein in his people, he refused to listen. I was powerless to stop him."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, Vincent's grandfather is the influential elder Declan."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's expression grew darker with anger, clearly showing that the situation was more complicated than he initially let on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then what happened?" Osborne pressed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, Vincent's people started challenging the younger generation of Dampston. You know how it works in the Augustine family. Everyone has the right to issue a compulsory challenge. Once it's issued, there's no turning it down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The younger generation of Dampston didn't have anyone strong enough to match Vincent's people. So, every challenge ended with them losing, getting injured, and suffering."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's account made Osborne's fists clench, his face turning icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's mind was filled with images of Vincent's minions ruthlessly challenging Nathan, Queenie, and Yulissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the vast difference in their strength, every challenge left them battered and bruised, and they endured both physical pain and verbal humiliation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The past month must have been a nightmare for them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was a storm of anger, but he struggled to control his emotions. "And Yulissa and Kendra? How did they suddenly disappear? Who's behind this?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hold on," Caleb said, raising a hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Things took a sharp turn a few days ago. After Yulissa was injured, Kendra, who was very close to her, snapped.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She stormed the arena and, with a single move, defeated the person who had hurt Yulissa. And that person was a master at Class AAA."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb looked surprised.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I completely misjudged her! I thought Kendra was just an ordinary person with no real power, but she's not only powerful. She's incredibly strong!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not long ago, she even took it upon herself to challenge Vincent directly."</p><div class="pagination">
