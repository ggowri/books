  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you're worthy of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent a shockwave through the crowd, eliciting gasps of disbelief as they stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected him to maintain such audacity in the face of Fabian. His brazen attitude and contempt made it clear that he viewed the Deity Overlord as nothing significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is he thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he want to die faster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is clearly out of his mind! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers from various factions couldn't help but look at Osborne with pity. What once was a sliver of hope for survival had evaporated into total despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Calvin, standing at a distance, shook his head in exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "He has truly lost it! I should have seen it coming when he stood up to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now he's talking to Fabian like that, thinking the Overlord won't dare act against him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a fool! Thank goodness we severed ties with him ages ago; otherwise, we'd be dragged into this mess with the other factions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, Fabian won't show him any mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin regarded "Lachlan" as though he were just a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Fabian's expression darkened with palpable rage. The menacing gleam in his eyes promised violence as his murderous intent soared, locking Osborne with deadly focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air chilled around them, making everyone nearby feel a shiver of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian was, after all, a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him to exude such terrifying intent illustrated just how infuriated he had become by Osborne's insolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian spat, his voice cold as ice. "Insignificant human. You're asking to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was willing to let your talent spare your life, but that chance is gone now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go meet your maker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Fabian lunged forward. His divine power surged, compressing into a devastating force in his fist as he struck at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous roar echoed through the air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power unleashed by this Deity Overlord warrior swept through the crowd. Even those at the peak of Celestial Deity, like Calvin, felt their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the difference between Celestial Deity and Deity Overlord seems small, but the gap in power is enormous! If Fabian unleashes his full punch, it could obliterate half of Wild Flame City and turn everything within a thirty-mile radius into wasteland!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, that terrifying energy is concentrated in his fist. I doubt even we Celestial Deities could stand against it; we'd either be dead or severely injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That pathetic human just broke through to Celestial Deity, and he dares to provoke Fabian. It's downright laughable! He's definitely going to be reduced to bloody pulp with this punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was in a state of shock, witnessing how serious Fabian was. He was clearly not holding back one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they watched Fabian's fist fly toward Osborne, they all felt that his fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stay alert! Once Fabian crushes that lowly human, we need to move fast and capture those unclaimed slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The various factions began to ready themselves, each one eager to seize the chance for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Calvin had braced himself, prepared to swoop in the moment "Lachlan" fell, ready to grab those slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, behind Osborne, the faces of Betty and the other "slaves" were ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, they desperately wanted to rush in and help Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, they held back, recalling his previous words of caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we step outside, none of you are allowed to intervene or speak a word! Even if it looks like I'm about to be killed, you mustn't act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The warriors from the other factions see you as nothing more than slaves, mere 'wealth' for them to seize. Until I'm dead, they won't dare touch you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the moment you try to help, they'll see you as my allies and go after you instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So no matter how dire things get for me, keep your hands to yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can handle this! Just trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the others tightened their fists, anxiety etched on their faces as they fought the urge to rush in and help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their hearts, they screamed, "Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wished they could lend all their strength to Osborne at that moment, desperately hoping he could survive Fabian's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that if Osborne fell, Spark of Blaze would perish with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would become victims, too, divided among Fabian and the warriors from the surrounding factions, dragged away like cattle to be put back on the market as slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, every member of Spark of Blaze worried for Osborne, hoping desperately that he truly had a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's attack was blindingly fast; after all, he was a Deity Overlord warrior. Even if speed wasn't his forte, he was on a level far beyond normal warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just about to be smashed by Fabian's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that instant, Osborne finally moved.</span></p><div class="pagination">
