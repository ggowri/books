  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My divine power has absorbed some characteristics from the Bloodstrike Orb? Corrosion?" Osborne exclaimed, his expression one of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea about this development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it was true that his Satan's Eye had completely absorbed the crimson energy of the Bloodstrike Orb and transformed it into pure power, he never considered that his divine power would change as a result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he recalled the Bloodstrike Orb's eerie crimson energy, his eyes lit up. The energy was undoubtedly one of the most bizarre forces he had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, even the Eighth World Tree offshoot, with a cultivation level comparable to an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, had struggled against the Bloodstrike Orb's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been nearly annihilated before finally absorbing the energy after being corroded to the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Bloodstrike Orb, neither Osborne nor Primordial would have been able to defeat the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To think that even an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King couldn't handle the corrosion effect..." Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Primordial. "Are you sure my divine power really has a corrosion effect similar to the Bloodstrike Orb? How do I harness that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied earnestly, "I'm absolutely certain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, I helped you compress your divine power! I sacrificed a full forty percent of the Tree Heart energy for that! Your divine power may not be incredibly strong yet due to your low cultivation level, but that corrosion characteristic is definitely enough to give any opponent a headache!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you would have figured it out by now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes. He thought, "How could I know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hardly ever use my divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My divine power is indeed stronger than most at the same cultivation level, especially after being compressed by Primordial. Compared to the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, it's only stronger, not weaker. But it's still not on par with my elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the time, I rely on elemental power to draw on the forces of nature to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My divine power... I mostly use it for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To me, its offensive capabilities pale in comparison to elemental power, or even my physical strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why I never noticed my divine power had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A highly compressed divine power with a corrosion effect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can it really break through Icy Six's defenses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial interjected, "Why don't you give it a shot and find out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"High-tier Supernal Deity Kings have formidable defenses, and their recovery speed is rapid. It's incredibly difficult to defeat an opponent through attrition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, the Eighth World Tree offshoot and the Creation Herald wouldn't have been locked in a stalemate for centuries! While that situation is exceptional, it does highlight the endurance of high-tier Supernal Deity Kings. Without a way to quickly break through their defenses, even if you're significantly stronger, it's tough to defeat them, let alone kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the God of Light, for instance... She's stronger than Icy One and the others and can dominate them in a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, when they banded together in defense, she couldn't break through completely, and it turned into a war of attrition where neither side could gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wouldn't lose, but she couldn't win either...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're different! Your strange eye absorbed the Bloodstrike Orb's unique energy, infusing your divine power with its corrosive effect, giving it a terrifying ability to breach defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The corrosive effect of Bloodstrike Orb energy was enough to overwhelm even the Eighth World Tree offshoot and the Creation Herald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if your divine power's corrosion effect is only a tenth or even a hundredth of the Bloodstrike Orb's, theoretically, it should be sufficient to pierce through Icy Six's defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you break through, he's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it! I'm going to give it a shot right now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne raised the Bloodwrought Bow once more. This time, however, he didn't enhance it with spatial power; he channeled his divine power directly into the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a blood-red arrow of divine power materialized atop the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first glance, the arrow didn't seem particularly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was far weaker than Osborne's spatial arrows, and even less impressive compared to his lightning or dark arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it looked like this divine power arrow couldn't possibly pose a threat to Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six, noticing Osborne's actions, sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just give it up! You can't touch me! I'll admit, your methods are quite strange; you've managed to suppress my cultivation level and create a real headache for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your spatial power is impressive, almost breaking through my defenses. But sadly, your cultivation level is still too low. You're just not strong enough to defeat me, let alone kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your spatial arrows couldn't do the job, what makes you think a weaker divine power arrow will? Face it, you're out of options. Just surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All your tricks are laid bare now, and once I go back and prepare, you won't stand a chance next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a murderous glint flickered in Icy Six's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort. "At this point, you still think you can kill me? How laughable! Who says I can't touch you? After this arrow, you'll know despair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Osborne released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red arrow of divine power shot forward with impressive speed, but compared to the spatial arrows, it seemed sluggish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Icy Six could easily dodge it, but with over a hundred Spatial Clones launching relentless attacks, he had no chance to evade it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, his defenses were solid as a rock, and he felt no fear of Osborne's divine power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A contemptuous smile appeared on his face. "You think that arrow will make me despair? What a joke! I could stand here and let you shoot at me for three years, and you wouldn't even graze a hair on my head..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Icy Six was speaking, the divine power arrow struck his defenses with a resounding impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow exploded against his divine power barrier, failing to penetrate or even create a small crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Icy Six's expression hardened drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that the explosive force of the divine power arrow didn't dissipate; instead, it clung to his divine power defenses like a parasite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a terrifying corrosion effect began to manifest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of sizzling filled the air as Icy Six's divine power defenses crackled ominously, reminiscent of molten lava splashing onto the ice, rapidly eroding and merging with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a gaping hole appeared in Icy Six's divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Icy Six gasped in horror, scrambling to channel more divine power to patch the breach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his terror, he found he couldn't do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corroded divine power defenses not only refused to recover but continued to expand!</span></p><div class="pagination">
