  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne continued, &quot;Alexander, do you really think that you are the reincarnation of the God of Thunder? Or the Son of Thunder? You are good for nothing. How dare you ask me to stay away from Clarissa?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His sudden curse stunned everyone. They looked at him in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was shocked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He did not expect Osborne to scold him suddenly. Since Alexander was a child, he had been the treasure of the Paltrow family. He had never suffered in his life, and the biggest difficulty he had encountered was learning to walk.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His family doted on him, protected him, and regarded him as the hope of the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No one even spoke to him loudly, let alone scolding him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne actually pointed at Alexander and insulted him, saying that he was good for nothing. Alexander was so dumbfounded that he forgot to retort for a moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Anger flickered in his eyes, and he flushed in a rage.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It took Alexander a while before he reacted and roared, &quot;Bastard, how dare you scold me? Don&#x27;t you know who I am? I order you to stay away from Clarissa, and you must listen to me, or I will kill you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying this, the power fluctuations around him became more violent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Countless streaks of lightning were running around Alexander wildly and seemed to be out of control. The people around him accidentally touched the lightning and screamed, falling to the ground with smoke all over their bodies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone was horrified, and they hurriedly stepped back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade&#x27;s expression changed. He rushed to Alexander and held his shoulders.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said, &quot;Calm down, Alexander!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You have just made a breakthrough, and your power is not stable. Don&#x27;t be emotional, or your power will get out of control. Suppress this chaotic power! Don&#x27;t let it destroy you!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Calm down!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade spoke quickly. The anger and murderous intent in Alexander&#x27;s eyes gradually dissipated. He looked puzzled and then felt panic.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just now, his power almost lost control because of his anger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Fortunately, Wade reminded him in time and woke him up, making it possible for Alexander to suppress his chaotic power quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander frowned and stared at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;Did Osborne deliberately provoke me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne felt a little disappointed. He didn&#x27;t expect Alexander to calm down at the critical moment because of Wade&#x27;s reminder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If it had been a little later, his plan would have succeeded, and Alexander&#x27;s power would have lost control due to his fury. Even if Alexander did not die, he would be seriously injured.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even the class of his power would decrease.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sighed in his heart, &quot;What a pity.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was disappointed, but he remained extremely calm. He looked at Alexander. Nobody knew what he was thinking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander snorted coldly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said to Wade, &quot;Thank you for your reminder. I&#x27;m fine. I was too impulsive just now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re all right.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He stepped back and glared at Osborne with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne had almost destroyed Alexander just now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter whether Osborne did it unwittingly or on purpose, Wade really wanted to kill Osborne. However, there were too many people around, and as a senior, he felt embarrassed to fight against Osborne in public.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade thought, &quot;Osborne must die!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Whether it&#x27;s because of Clarissa or other reasons, he is the heir of the Augustine family, and he must die. Alexander is not in a stable state during this period. I have to take action.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With this in mind, he stepped back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander had completely calmed down. He stared at Osborne coldly and said, &quot;Good. It seems that you are not ready to give up Clarissa and want to compete with me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sneered, &quot;Compete with you? Are you kidding? Clarissa is my girlfriend, and she only loves me. Who do you think you are?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne tried to anger Alexander again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander had just been in a trap, and he could control his emotions this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He snorted coldly, &quot;Osborne, you only dare to curse me. Dare you to accept my challenge? It is not convenient for me to take action now. Even if I only use 10% of my power, it&#x27;s no problem to defeat a loser like you or even kill you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s expression suddenly changed when he heard this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said calmly, &quot;Stop bragging, okay? Even if you are a Class A Power Master, you can&#x27;t kill me with 10% of your power.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare to accept my challenge?&quot; Alexander provoked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne smiled, &quot;I can accept it, but what good would that do me? Why should I take your attack for no reason? I&#x27;m not a fool.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander frowned and started thinking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After a while, he said, &quot;Let&#x27;s make a bet.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What&#x27;ll you bet?&quot; Osborne asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let&#x27;s bet on whether you can take my attack and survive.&quot; Alexander was confident. &quot;If you die, you deserve it. If you survive, I will give you an ancient magic weapon, which is at least level three!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The crowd was shocked. They couldn&#x27;t help but whisper.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An ancient magic weapon of at least level three?</p><p style="text-align:left;">The bet was so big!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was a little surprised, thinking, &quot;An ancient magic weapon of at least level three?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Such an ancient magic weapon may be a treasure of the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Is Alexander really willing to give it to me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isn&#x27;t he afraid of losing?&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
