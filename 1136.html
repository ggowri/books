  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't get through?" Osborne murmured, his brow furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few inquiries, he learned that no one had seen </span><span>Clarissa in three months, and his expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's happened to Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, he found a voice message from Clarissa buried among the many notifications on his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Isa needs my help with something, so I'm going to be away for a while. Don't worry about me; I'll be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just take care of yourself and wait for my return! Love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished listening to Clarissa's message, Osborne sat there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow knitted tighter as confusion washed over him. "Clarissa left with Isa? Isa needs Clarissa's help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa just barely broke through to Class S; she's not even as strong as I am!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would Isa ask her for help instead of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled him even more was that it wasn't just Clarissa who had left with Isa; Emma and Austin had gone too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found their messages waiting for him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma had said, "Osborne, I'm leaving! Your girlfriend Isa said she needed my help with something really important. She's so bossy that I couldn't say no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, I'll be fine. She promised that by the time I get back, I'll be stronger than you. I can't wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had said, "I'm sorry I didn't get pregnant with your child, so I've been too scared to reach out. Now I'm leaving with Clarissa and the others. Don't worry about us. Oh, and it seems like Clarissa knows about us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he read their messages, Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa leaving doesn't surprise me, but why did she take Clarissa, Emma, and even Austin with her? What is she planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, and he tried calling each of them, but all his attempts went unanswered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Osborne ran a hand through his hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry? How can I not worry? Isa might be powerful, but whatever she's doing is just as dangerous! She once told me I was too weak to help her, yet she took Clarissa, Emma, and Austin&mdash;who are all weaker than I am! What on earth is she up to?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was filled with anxiety, but he felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been gone for three months!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he </span><span>wanted to find them, he had no idea where to start looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Isa's strength, if she didn't want him to find them, he wouldn't stand a </span><span>chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, when you come back, just wait and see how I'll give you a good punishment!" Osborne thought, grinding his teeth in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all he could do was pray for the safety of the women and wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong?" Anastasia asked, concern lacing her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, pushing his worries down and forcing a smile. "I'm fine! How about I take you out for some fun, Anastasia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where are we going to go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment before replying, "How about I take you to see the tigers? You've always wanted to go to the </span><span>zoo and see them before you fell ill. But back then, I didn't have the money, and I never got to take you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, in the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, there are over 200 thousand beasts gathered. I'm sure there are plenty of tigers among them. Dare you go with me to check it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes lit up even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do! Don't underestimate me, Osborne. I'm a top-tier Class S powerhouse now, you know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Mr. Sebastian Augustine praised my skills!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And guess what? He even gave me two divine artifacts&mdash;one for offense and one for defense! I'm pretty awesome now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's boastful tone caught Osborne off guard, and he was visibly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied Anastasia closely and, sure enough, could sense the power fluctuations of a top-tier Class S warrior emanating from her. It was faint but undeniable; he hadn't noticed it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Top-tier Class S? You're catching up to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia beamed proudly at him. "That's right! Zoe has already broken through to Class S too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Zoe has broken through to Class S as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last</span><span> I remember, three months ago, she had only just broken through to Class A. Sure, the energy on Blue Planet has surged a thousandfold recently, but going from Class A to Class S in just three months?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's lightning fast! Is Zoe some kind of super genius?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned serious as he looked between Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he asked, "Anastasia, Zoe... do you remember anything about your parents? Do you know who they are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, both girls faltered, their expressions clouding with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shook their heads simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't remember anything before I was five," Anastasia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same here," Zoe added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both looked at Osborne questioningly. "Do you know something about our parents, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, a weight settling heavily on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Should I tell them what I suspect? Is now the right time?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
