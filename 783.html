  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A creepy laugh echoed through the Lambert family, chilling everyone's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They turned around, their expressions tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Eityreia Organization assassins arrived. The six of them were all shrouded in black robes. Only half of their faces were visible, revealing cold, murderous eyes that sent shivers down the spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when they all stared at the Lambert family, causing everyone to tense up even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be Aleena, the Lambert family's leader?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The leading assassin taunted as he stared at Aleena. Aleena's expression was grave. "That's right, I am Aleena. Who are you, and what do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assassin in black sneered. "Remember my codename, Mose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mose?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's expression changed, growing even more serious as her body tensed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mose? The one ranked 205th on the Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose glanced at Osborne and smirked. "That's right, it's me! You must be Axell, right? The one who defeated Roger and Andrew? Heh, impressive. I heard your sixth sense can counter Roger's stealth. If we get a chance, we should fight, not on the stage but out in the wild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope you'll be able to see through my stealth and dodge my Stealth Arts. Otherwise, you'll just end up a corpse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, a murderous glint flashed in Mose's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned. Was Mose threatening him? Was he warning that an assassination could happen at any moment?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne scoffed. "If you're not afraid to die, go ahead and try. Let's see who ends up as the corpse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose paused, then grinned widely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha ha ha! Good! I like arrogant people. The more arrogant they are, the more satisfying it is to kill them! I'll come for you soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Mose sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other five Eityreia Organization assassins glanced coldly at Osborne, disdain in their eyes. They said nothing and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose took a seat right next to Aleena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could sense Aleena was completely on edge, not daring to relax even a little, as if she expected an attack at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Mose's eyes were filled with mockery and contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke up, "Aleena, why don't we switch seats? I feel an instant connection with Mose, and I'd like to have a good chat with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena was stunned at Osborne's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, there's no need..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena began, wanting to remind him that Osborne wasn't part of the Lambert family and didn't need to involve himself in their feud with the Eityreia Organization assassins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly, cutting her off. "Don't worry, Aleena. I'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena hesitated for a moment. Seeing the confidence in Osborne's eyes, she reluctantly stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be careful, Axell!" she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Eityreia Organization assassins aren't supposed to cause trouble during the Honor Quest Ceremony, but there are no guarantees. They never play by the rules!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, the Williamson family specifically placed them next to us. They have a close relationship with the Eityreia Organization assassins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mose might attack you when you least expect it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena finished, her face full of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained calm and nodded. "I understand, Aleena."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, he took Aleena's seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma quickly shifted to sit beside Osborne, leaving Aleena to take her seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose glanced coldly at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you afraid of dying? Did you dare to sit next to me? Don't you know that from this distance, I could kill you in an instant if I wanted to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And the Williamson family wouldn't even hold it against me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled lightly. "Of course, I'm afraid of dying! The reason I'm sitting next to you is because I don't think you can kill me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't believe me, go ahead and try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you make a move and I kill you instead, the Williamson family wouldn't blame me, would they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Mose's expression instantly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you provoking me? Do you think I won't attack? You're courting death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then go ahead, make your move."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained calm, his gaze locked on Mose. "If you're confident, go ahead. Let's see who kills whom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose clenched his fists, glaring coldly at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You want to die? I'll make it happen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's body tensed as if he was ready to strike at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this close range, Mose was certain he could kill Osborne quickly, leaving him with no chance to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying killing intent radiated from Mose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body tensed as well.</p><div class="pagination">
