This is just a rumor; it can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! It's just gossip! The God of Night hasn't shown his face in decades, and Isa only came to Celestara twenty years ago. They probably never even met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But wait, Isa is indeed the God of Night's disciple. If they never crossed paths, how could he have trained her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, but the God of Night has been missing for so long</span><span>. H</span><span>e could have just disappeared to train Isa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how could Isa possibly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation fell into a murmur of confusion, with everyone glancing at Osborne, worry etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, clenching his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's words felt like a vice around his heart, but he fought to remain composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze back to Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, still reeling from the shock of their reactions, realized that they all seemed to know Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was likely more to the story between Isa and Osborne than she had initially thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "You're saying Isa is the God of Night's woman? Is that just hearsay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah opened her mouth as if to explain but hesitated, caught between her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell me the truth, whatever you know. Don't hold back," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of biting her lip, Hannah finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't just a rumor! Isa herself admitted it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She said she is the God of Night's disciple and also his woman. The God of Light confirmed this, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the God of Night missing for decades, the Human Community was getting anxious. But when Isa stepped forward, she declared that the God of Night was still alive and would return when needed. With the God of Light backing her up, the Human Community regained its confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, they would have fallen into chaos before the Dark Deity Legion even attacked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes were filled with concern as she looked at Osborne. "Osborne, what's your relationship with Isa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, the weight of her question hanging heavily in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, and Kendra exchanged worried glances, and even Bryce had grown quiet, his brow knotted in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent the most time with Isa, and she had made it clear to him on more than one occasion that Osborne was her man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in Celestara, how could Isa claim to be the God of Night's woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's gaze settled on Osborne, their expressions a mix of concern and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, grappling with the weight of Hannah's words. His body trembled slightly</span><span> and</span><span> betray</span><span>ed</span><span> the anxiety and turmoil churning within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia who finally broke the silence, gripping Osborne's arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this can't be true! I refuse to believe that Isa would betray you like that! There has to be a reason for what she said! Maybe she just wanted to strengthen her own position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! That's got to be it!" Zoe chimed in, wrapping her arms around his other arm with a determined look, trying to comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she, with her limited understanding, could see the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was Osborne's woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a pang of discomfort washed over Hannah as she finally grasped why Osborne had refused to marry into the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "With a woman like Isa by his side, how could he ever look at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Isa is truly Osborne's woman, why would she claim to be the God of Night's woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And while Osborne is powerful, the gap between him and Isa seems insurmountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Isa possibly be his woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt a whirlwind of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne spoke up, his voice steady but strained, "Alright, you don't need to comfort me. I'm fine! Just like you said, even if Isa claimed to be the God of Night's </span><span>woman, it might have been out of necessity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be heading to the West Zone soon, and I'll ask her directly. If..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, Osborne's heart twisted painfully, and he couldn't continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Isa aligning herself with the God of Night was almost too much to bear. Memories of their time together flashed through his mind, and he felt as if he was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he managed to calm himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Isa really chose the God of Night, then I'll wish her well. After all, compared to the God of Night, what am I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a self-deprecating smile, masking the turmoil beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get back to business!" he said, shifting the focus back to the pressing matters at hand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
