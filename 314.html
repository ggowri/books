  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's biggest problem was the limited means of making money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison to other ancient clans, the family members were not adept at running companies. Their primary source of income was an international tourism company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent a substantial amount of money purchasing eighteen luxury cruise ships and opening multiple high-end cruise routes. During its heyday, these endeavors brought in a significant daily income for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they encountered issues with their business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever the Augustine family's cruise ships set sail, accidents would inevitably occur. Most of the cruise ships sustained varying degrees of damage and had to be docked in shipyards for repairs. Additionally, substantial compensation was paid to injured passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most critical issue was that the reputation of the Augustine family's cruise ships had become extremely poor. Many tourists were concerned about boarding their ships, fearing potential dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the number of tourists decreased by over 90%. Even the three remaining undamaged cruise ships struggled to attract enough customers, making it impossible to cover regular operating expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were any other ancient clan, they would likely have diversified industries to mitigate risks and avoid being heavily reliant on a single business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for the Augustine family, about 80% of their income came from the cruise ship industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the decline in business due to the troubled state of the cruise ships, coupled with several core members, including the family head, Allen, experiencing accidents, the family suddenly found themselves in a precarious situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not handled properly, the family would face a decline, and it would be expected for them to withdraw from Dampston altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To resolve the difficulties faced by the family, the first thing we need to do is to restore their business and start making money again! Otherwise, with such a large family, even the daily expenses alone could crush them," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as long as the cruise ships set sail, they would encounter issues. If that matter weren't resolved, the family business would have never been able to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I have no choice but to go out to sea myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I want to see who is targeting the Augustine family. If I catch one, I may be able to find the mastermind behind the scenes and solve the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, I am now the heir of the family. They should have made this news public. The entire upper class of Dampston should know about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's traitor may leak out the news of my voyage, and the mastermind behind the scenes may personally target me, intending to kill me and destroy the Augustine family's hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, not only can I find the mastermind behind all this, but I might even be able to expose the traitor within the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a decision and started preparing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, just as Osborne thought, the news that he became the heir of the Augustine family quickly swept the entire upper-class society of Dampston after the Augustine family announced it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, in a mansion north of Pinchide City, Barlyn stared in disbelief at the news he had just received. Rubbing his eyes, he thought he had seen it wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family of Dampston has announced the appointment of their heir three days ago. The new heir is named Osborne Augustine, who is the long-lost son of the former family head, Allen Augustine, who went missing over twenty years ago. After more than twenty years of searching, the family finally located Osborne in Mayby City, a neighboring city in Skyefall. Following a thorough evaluation, The Wise Order of the Augustine family agreed and appointed him as the young master of their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is actually the young master of the Augustine family? I thought he was joking before! I didn't expect it to be true. He is the son of Allen, the family head of the Augustine family, the same son who went missing over twenty years ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything makes sense now! No wonder Osborne, being an orphan, is so formidable!" Barlyn exclaimed in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Donna was also present in the mansion, wearing a complicated expression on her face. She couldn't help but let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would have thought that Osborne actually had such an identity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only we had known earlier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, it's too late now. The Patriarch and The Wise Order have already arranged the marriage between Clarissa and Alexander. They are waiting for one more month when Alexander breaks through to Class A and becomes a Class A power master. Then, Clarissa will marry him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Osborne has become the heir of the Augustine family and the family's strength is not weaker than the Radcliffe family, compared to the Paltrow family, they are still far behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna paused for a while and continued, "Among the nine ancient families in Dampston, the Paltrow family ranks in the top three and can even compete for first place. Meanwhile, the Augustine family can only be considered at the bottom, and now they have encountered major troubles. If these issues are not resolved, they could easily decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's identity and background are still far inferior to Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wise Order still won't agree to Clarissa being with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn bit his lip tightly and complained, "How can the elders do this! Don't they know that Clarissa likes Osborne? It's fine that if he is just an ordinary person, but he is now the heir of the Augustine family. Why do they have to separate the couple? Don't they consider what Clarissa thinks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was angry and disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head and said, "There is no way to change it! If we break off the engagement with the Paltrow family at this time, it will only offend the family, and we can't afford it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn punched the wall with all his might, venting his dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the ancient Paltrow Estate, Alexander also received this news, and his expression was somehow complicated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
