  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up and die!" With those icy words, Osborne unleashed an unrelenting storm of thunder that enveloped everyone on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The late-stage lightning elemental essence he commanded was terrifying beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the guards of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family tried desperately to defend themselves, they stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their cultivation levels had already been suppressed to Ascension Two, their efforts were futile against the overwhelming power of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the lightning finally subsided, the ground lay littered with over twenty charred corpses, each face frozen in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet one soul remained standing, clutching her head and screaming at the top of her lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Princess Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't forgotten the deal he made with Alfreda. Monica had been a persistent thorn in Alfreda's side, and it was her actions that had forced Alfreda to leave Elf City and venture into the peril of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda wanted nothing more than to kill Monica herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne had spared Monica's life, but her shrill, wailing screams had driven him to kick her away with little more than a flick of his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop screaming! You're still breathing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was dismissive as he turned to Alfreda, whose gaze was fixed on him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stood within the borders of the absolute forbidden zone, her own cultivation level severely diminished to Ascension Two, just like the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing how effortlessly Osborne dispatched those at her same level filled her with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran through her as she took in the carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda realized fully that she was no match for Osborne in her current state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been at her peak&mdash;still at Ascension Five&mdash;she might have had a fighting chance, even if she couldn't claim victory outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this reduced state, there was no way she could emerge victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if Alfreda really fought against Osborne, as long as Osborne used the absolute forbidden zone, she would be easily defeated by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda couldn't spare a thought for her greatest rival, Princess Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she stepped closer to Osborne, curiosity and awe swirling in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda opened her mouth, struggling to find the right words. The power he had just displayed was overwhelming, almost beyond comprehension, leaving her wondering how to articulate her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Is Osborne truly from the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way he's just human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's got to be part of an Apex Clan like the Sacred Dragon Clan, the Sacred Tiger Clan, or the Angel Clan, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a prodigy from one of those Apex Clans could wield such ferocity at Ascension Two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain her curiosity, she finally blurted out her question, her gaze earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, just tell me the truth&mdash;what's your real race? You're not from the Human Community, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her inquiry, Osborne paused, his expression a mix of surprise and humor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else could I possibly be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda tilted her head, testing her luck. "Come on, just tell me! I promise I won't spill a word! You're actually from the Sacred Dragon Clan, right? You're disguised as Human to keep your identity hidden while you train, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, gently patting her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't jump to conclusions! I'm not from the Sacred Dragon Clan. In fact, I've never even met one! I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill Human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that revelation, frustration twisted Alfreda's brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She narrowed her eyes, contemplating his words. After a long pause, Alfreda finally spoke up, "Once we get back to Elf City, I'm taking you to the Astral Testing Arch for a proper test. If you really are just an ordinary Human, I suspect your total score might just hit Class SSS! You could be one of the rare Celestial Progeny in this cosmos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Progeny? Me?" Osborne chuckled, pointing at himself in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the thought wasn't entirely far-fetched. Alfreda had reached a Class SS score at the Astral Testing Arch, and if they fought at the same cultivation level, he was confident she wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious from this that his talent far outshines Alfreda's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I really do meet the criteria for being called a Celestial Progeny," he mused, intrigued by the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Osborne said, "I guess I'll find out once we hit the Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, though, we need to deal with her." Osborne gestured toward Princess Monica, who lay on the ground, her eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression turned icy as she looked at Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath her calm exterior, a storm of hatred and anger simmered, a faint glimmer of murderous intent flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica cried out, her voice trembling, "No! Don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, I know I was wrong! Please, spare me! I promise I'll never bother you again! I'll be your servant, I'll do anything you want!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, we're both from the Elf Race! Have mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pleas grew more desperate, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica begged for her life, the weight of her noble status crashing down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a princess of the Fire Elf Clan, she had always held a high position in Elf City, and now she found herself on the brink of death, regretting every decision that had led her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all she could think was how she wished she had never set foot in Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had stayed in Elf City, she would never have faced such peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda would never have had the chance to end her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, she crawled toward Alfreda, clutching her legs and sobbing loudly, hoping for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda merely stared down at her, her expression cold, filled with disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift kick, she sent Monica sprawling across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monica, for your own dignity, you should just accept your fate! I will kill you! You've provoked me for years, and I swore I would end you one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially when I saw your father pressuring mine at the Nature Kingdom, forcing my father to bow to him to protect me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've sworn it, and now the time has come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how much you beg, I will not spare you! So stop crying; it only makes me look down on you more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's voice dripped with contempt as she continued, "I'll send you off to reunite with your brother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, in your next life, don't bully others just because you think you're powerful...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, be a better person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her wrist, a vibrant green vine shot forth, piercing Monica's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica's terrified scream echoed in the air, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only watch in horror as the vine plunged deep into her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gurgling, blood spilled from her lips as she looked at Alfreda with disbelief and fury, life slipping away from her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, you'll regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Fire Elf Clan will avenge me... just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final, defiant glare, Monica collapsed to the ground, her body going limp as the last flicker of life faded from her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
