  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo unleashed his interdimensional travel, a hallmark of his incredible spatial powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always prided himself on his own abilities within that realm, but at that moment, he realized just how outmatched he truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even react, Osborne found himself whisked away by Gerardo's might. When he came to his senses, Osborne was no longer at the Campbell headquarters but hovering over an endless expanse of ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief as he surveyed the rolling waves below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearest shoreline was a staggering 300 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power of Gerardo's interdimensional travel; he had been transported far beyond the range of any immediate escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such overwhelming spatial power!" Osborne thought with anxiety setting in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced toward Gerardo, who was now watching him with an unsettling calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Osborne attempted to harness his own spatial power to flee, but in the next heartbeat, shock washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no connection to the forces of space; it was as if they had vanished entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo turned his gaze to Osborne, a mocking smile spreading across his face. "Don't even think about running. I know you're a spatial power user too, but let me make it clear&mdash;you're completely powerless against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steeling himself, he asked, "What do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo leaned casually back, a glint of amusement in his eyes. "Didn't I already make that clear? I intend to capture you and force Sebastian out of hiding. I want him dead. Our feud has lingered for decades, and </span><span>it's</span><span> high time to end it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The last time, he slipped through my fingers, and I have no idea where he</span><span>'</span><span>s recuperating. As long as he breathes, I can't find peace. But you? You're his chosen heir, and I know he'll come to save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, </span><span>"</span><span>Gerardo intends to use me as bait to draw out Grandpa? To kill him once and for all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw. "You really think I'll just go along with your plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo chuckled. "You have to. After all, you stand no chance against me! Even if you're the top-ranked in Godson Rankings, you're still just a Class AAA&mdash;easily dealt with. If you doubt that, feel free to try." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tucked his hands behind his back with an arrogant smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll give it a shot," Osborne growled, determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't sit idly by and await his fate. Taking a deep breath, Osborne activated his Light Realm, enveloping Gerardo in a dazzling glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of light surged toward Gerardo, each ray crackling with energy. Yet, Gerardo remained unfazed, his arms still crossed behind him, revealing a casual indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break!" Gerardo commanded with a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, every single light sphere and ray shattered into nothingness, and Osborne felt his Light Realm tremble violently before it abruptly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasping, he spat out a mouthful of blood, his shock palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Gerardo in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "He hasn't even moved, yet he has destroyed my most powerful attack with a mere command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's strength was leagues ahead of Everett's, giving Osborne the overwhelming impression that he was utterly invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo looked at Osborne, amusement flickering in his eyes. "I told you, in my presence, you have no standing to resist! Your Level Four Light Realm is impressive, I'll admit. Even my Spatial Domain hasn't reached that level yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad your own strength is just too weak. If you had reached Class S, maybe you could last a few rounds against me, but right now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, you're pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his disdain palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cooperate with me, you might buy yourself some time. After I kill Sebastian, if you offer your loyalty, I might even let you live and grant you greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's up to you how you want to play this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo finished speaking, a terrifying force bore down on Osborne, suffocating him and leaving him feeling utterly immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled significantly as he clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Gerardo was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, Osborne was indeed too weak, far from being a match for him. If Gerardo wanted him dead, it would be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his tricks fell flat against such overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne still held a trump card, the power of his right leg's Divine Bone, he sensed that even that wouldn't be enough to break through Gerardo's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, Osborne scrambled for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with such a monumental gap in strength, how could he possibly come up with a plan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo noticed Osborne's silence and snorted dismissively. "Looks like you don't want to play ball with me! In that case, I'll just have to take matters into my own hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a rope shot out, piercing Osborne's body like lightning.</span></p><div class="pagination">
