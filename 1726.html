  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To help Hannah return more swiftly, Osborne opened a dimensional portal using his spatial powers, allowing her to make a direct trip back to the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Hannah vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Hannah will run into trouble?" Anastasia asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully. "Of course! Things won't go smoothly for her. The Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City has over a million members, divided into dozens of factions with differing agendas. It's going to be tough for Hannah to earn their trust and persuade them to hide in the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If even Hannah doubts that the Bowman family plans to wipe out the Mystic Feather Clan, how can the others be expected to believe it? Honestly, without some casualties, the Mystic Feather Clan won't simply abandon their floating mountain and the lives they've built in Wild Flame City to squeeze into the Microcosm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the others nodded in agreement</span><span>. They </span><span>underst</span><span>ood</span><span> the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all prepare for battle! The Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City has helped the Human Community a lot. We need to do everything we can to minimize casualties," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" the group replied, steeling themselves for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team hid in a parallel space, keeping an eye on the movements of the Bowman family and the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they witnessed elite warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Bowman family's guard were also preparing, and an ominous air settled over everyone as they observed the assembly of skilled fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but comment, "The Demonic Dragon Clan really is formidable! They are undoubtedly the strongest race in Wild Flame City. Just look at them casually gathering over five Deity Kings, more than a hundred peak Deity Overlords, and well over a thousand Deity Overlord warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded, acknowledging the impressive display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply. "But compared to the Bowman family, the Demonic Dragon Clan is somewhat ordinary. The Bowman family has Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King, and, shockingly, nine early-stage Deity Kings in their ranks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On top of that, their escort comprises nearly three hundred peak Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you throw in the Soaring Lion Clan, they could easily muster about 20 Deity Kings and around five hundred peak Deity Overlords! That's an overwhelming force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can the Mystic Feather Clan possibly stand against them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should get this information to Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for what Hannah and the Mystic Feather Clan decide to do, there's not much I can change now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using a terminal, Osborne quickly transmitted the situation he had observed to Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hannah had already returned to the Gellar family's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, here's the situation! I saw everything with my own eyes. Please don't ask me how</span><span>. </span><span>I need to keep that a secret! But you have to believe me, it's the truth! Things are dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family, along with the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan, are rallying their warriors. They're set to attack our Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain soon, aiming to exterminate all of us from Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must act immediately! The only option we have is to get all the members of the </span><span>Mystic Feather Clan inside my Dimensional Microcosm for safety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes sparkled with hope as she looked at her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man was Raoul Gellar, the patriarch of the Gellar family and also Hannah's grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the only Deity King warrior within the family and held significant status among the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City. After all, the Gellar family ranked among the top three strongest families in the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah knew she couldn't convince the various factions of the Mystic Feather Clan on her own; she needed her grandfather, Raoul, to step in if they had any chance of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's expression was grim, heavy with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, it's not that I don't believe you. It's just that what you're saying is beyond anything I could have imagined! The Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan are actually rallying the Bowman family to wipe out the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's hard for me to swallow, and if I struggle with it, how can I expect the other factions to accept this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, feeling the urgency of the moment, stepped closer. "Grandpa! You've watched me grow up; have you ever seen me lie? I'm not making this up! I witnessed it all firsthand. Just trust me this once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the very least, we need to prepare everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, when the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, and the Bowman family surround us, it'll be too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Hannah's terminal buzzed, catching her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the screen, and her expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? They've gathered 20 Deity King warriors and over two thousand Deity Overlord warriors? And among them, five hundred are peak Deity Overlords?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening</span><span>. T</span><span>hey really intend to exterminate us all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's face fell as he absorbed the information. "Twenty Deity King warriors?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression flickered between disbelief and dread. If this was true, the Mystic Feather Clan was facing an existential threat, a potential annihilation of their entire lineage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
