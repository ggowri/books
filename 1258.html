  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over three months ago, the God of Time, Ophelia, finally broke through to Class S and regained her memories. From that moment on, time on Blue Planet accelerated, restoring the natural flow of energy to its normal state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambient energy surged a hundredfold, and even ordinary people began to awaken their latent powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a rich environment, the strength of any metahuman skyrocketed as if they were on a rocket launch. The members of the Augustine family were no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially in the Augustine Bastion, where the concentration of energy was a hundred times greater than outside, the speed of cultivation was dramatically enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The progress made by the Augustine family during this time was nothing short of astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class S warriors had already surpassed five hundred&mdash;a figure that would have seemed unimaginable just three months ago. Now, it was commonplace, with more family members breaking through to Class S every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given this rapid advancement, Osborne knew he had to consider the next step: forging Divine Bodies to achieve godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phoenix Ascension technique had to be imparted to the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By allowing each of them to elevate their Divine Body by two levels upon breaking through, the overall strength of the Augustine family could potentially increase several times over, even tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Phoenix Ascension was far too crucial to be leaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already devised a plan to keep it under wraps, but he spent three days meticulously analyzing any potential flaws in his strategy, ensuring that every loophole was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once satisfied, Osborne turned his attention to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past three days, every single one of the one hundred members from the Blood Demon Vanguard had successfully broken through, forging their own Divine Bodies and becoming Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused intently on the Divine Flames flickering above their heads, eager to assess the effects of the Phoenix Ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "Yellow Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yellow Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Green Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Green Divine Flame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining the Divine Flames of the Blood Demon Vanguard, Osborne could hardly contain his elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All one hundred members had achieved at least a Level Three Divine Body, with twelve of them reaching Level Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phoenix Ascension is truly powerful! It's incredible how it has elevated their Divine Bodies by two full levels! Most of them had average talent and could only forge a Level One Divine Body, but now they're at Level Three! Those who could manage a Level Two Divine Body are now at Level Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Junior Deity with a Level Four Divine Body would be considered a top-tier genius even in the Age of Gods! Each of them has the potential to become a Celestial Deity or a Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those twelve with Level Four Divine Bodies? They could even become Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was practically vibrating with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Age of Gods, those who managed to attain a Level Four Divine Body upon becoming a Junior Deity were not exactly a dime a dozen, but they were not exactly rare either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the number of individuals who ascended to the rank of Deity King was a </span><span>much smaller, more exclusive club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While having the potential to become a Deity King didn't guarantee the title, it did signify that the members of the Blood Demon had matched, if not surpassed, the talents of the most monstrous prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their prowess was undeniably superior to that of their fellow Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time to let more Blood Demon members break through to godhood!" Osborne mused, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously amassed a vast amount of blood energy, enough to directly forge Divine Bodies for two thousand Blood Demon members, allowing them to become Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he hesitated to take that route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should distribute this blood energy evenly among the four thousand seven hundred Blood Demon members. That way, none of them will break through to godhood immediately, but they'll be close enough that with a bit more cultivation, they'll all forge their Divine Bodies and ascend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the high concentration of energy here, they should be able to complete their breakthroughs within half a month to a month at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a safe bet&mdash;the Augustine family won't be in any immediate danger by then. This is the best course of action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mind made up, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast reservoir of blood energy was meticulously divided among the Blood Demon members. They were then positioned to absorb the surrounding environment's energy, which was a hundredfold more potent than usual, pushing them toward their final breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was set in motion, Osborne turned his attention to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member of the Augustine family was called in, according to their cultivation level, into Osborne's personal training chamber. One by one, he taught them Phoenix Ascension. But that wasn't all. After the lesson, Osborne embedded a special command into their memories&mdash;a kind of mental code.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This implant made them swear, from the depths of their souls, never to utter a word about Phoenix Ascension to anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if anyone tried to pry the secret from them, either through interrogation or memory extraction, the code would trigger, erasing every trace of Phoenix Ascension from their minds to protect the secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was foolproof. Phoenix Ascension was now locked tight within the family, and no one could leak it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Osborne over half a month, but eventually, every member of the Augustine family had learned Phoenix Ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted but satisfied, Osborne leaned back with a smirk. "Finally done! Now, what's next on my agenda? Should I go for a breakthrough to Intermediate Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or should I move forward with the third stage of the fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
