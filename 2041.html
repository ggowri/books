  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, materializing beside Jethro and the others, "No need to rush over and help! With our current strength, we wouldn't be of any use to the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd only distract her and make her worry about protecting us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, are you all okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded with a smile. "We're all fine! Everything has gone pretty much as you predicted. The only surprise was that it was the Jackson family who betrayed the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a glance at Julian, who rolled his eyes in response, knowing exactly what Jethro was implying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Jethro and Osborne had suspected him of being the traitor all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glad to hear that," Osborne replied, giving Julian a nod before turning his attention to the final battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over there, the God of Light was locked in an intense struggle against Icy One and his four comrades. The very air crackled with the residual energy of their clash, and Osborne could feel the immense pressure weighing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current level of power, he felt utterly unqualified to join that fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "My strength is still too weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just taking down Icy Six nearly exhausted every trick I had up my sleeve. If we faced off again, I might not even manage to defeat him! After all, my absolute forbidden zone has its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once someone steps out of its range, they're no longer suppressed. Icy Six was simply overconfident, convinced he could kill me even while reduced to an Ascension Five cultivation level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd just retreated the moment he had the chance, he could have regained his Ascension Six strength... I wouldn't stand a chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, facing the God of Light are five individuals, each far stronger than Icy Six. Any one of them would wipe the floor with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was mounting, and Osborne couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken down Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight, along with over a thousand Supernal Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence. I'm sure the Paramount Supreme Clan won't let this slide easily! They'll want revenge, and I can only imagine what kind of stronger forces they'll send after me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tonight, they might be so enraged that they'll launch a full-scale war against the Human Community, especially since they see no hope of winning in the upcoming competition. If that happens, the God of Light will be too busy managing the bigger picture to protect me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll be on my own! I need to get stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave. He desperately wished his cultivation level matched that of the God of Light&mdash;an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ascension Six or Five would suffice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could reach Ascension Four, he might stand a chance of protecting himself and influencing the course of this war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, he was still stuck at Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without some extraordinary opportunity, even breaking through to Ascension Two would take considerable time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to think of a way to delay the onset of full-scale war! Even a few days would be better than an immediate outbreak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he brainstormed solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the battle surged, the shockwaves growing fiercer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the God of Light and Icy One's group were fully engaged, as if they were fighting for their very lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocity of their clash was palpable, even from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a spark of inspiration lit up in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I can push back the war's start after all! Let's hope I can pull this off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the God of Light was locked in a fierce battle with Icy One and his four allies when she suddenly felt a jolt in her mind. It was Osborne's voice, echoing in her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, it's me, Osborne. I've taken down Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight! Not to mention, I've also eliminated three hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Jackson family who betrayed the Human Community and one thousand under Lord Malevolence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne is alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just alive, but he's actually killed Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew all too well the strength of Icy Six, having battled him many times. While the God of Light could easily defeat him, killing him was an entirely different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "But now, Osborne claims he's done just that? This can't be a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light asked in her mind, "Osborne, you're not pulling my leg, are you? How did you manage that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, at a time like this, do you really think I'd be joking? They're really dead! As for how I did it, that's my secret. What matters is that they're gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I'm worried that the Paramount Supreme Clan will be furious and might launch an all-out war against the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light froze, momentarily distracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She barely dodged an attack from Icy One, quickly snapping back to the fight while continuing to communicate with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your concerns are valid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly killed Icy Six, the Paramount Supreme Clan will undoubtedly be enraged! With you still alive, they'll see no hope of winning in the upcoming competition and will likely choose to strike first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While that would allow us to fortify ourselves in Peaks City and inflict heavy losses on the Dark Deity Legion, an outright war would still be more advantageous for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression serious. "That's exactly what I'm afraid of! So, I've come up with a plan that might delay the Paramount Supreme Clan's decision to go to war."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your plan?" the God of Light asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's simple. I'm going to 'die.' If I'm out of the picture, the Paramount Supreme Clan will think sacrificing Icy Six and the others was worth it. Plus, if I don't participate in the competition, they'll see a glimmer of hope for victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll keep pushing forward in the competition, hoping to crush the morale of the Human Alliance while gaining control of Peaks City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to go die? Are you talking about a real death or a fake one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, exasperated. Sometimes, he found the God of Light a bit too na&iuml;ve for her own good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I mean a fake death! I'm planning to do this, but I need your cooperation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne explained his plan in detail, and the God of Light's face grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I can't agree to this! It's far too risky. Icy One is an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King. If things go south, you could... you could..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't finish her sentence, the implications too dire to voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly interjected, "Esteemed God of Light, don't worry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have special methods in place to ensure I won't actually die! Right now, this is our only option!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't act, the Paramount Supreme Clan will be humiliated and will launch a full-scale war immediately. How many lives will be lost then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made up my mind! I'm going in&mdash;please, just cooperate with me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
