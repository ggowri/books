  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief as he looked at Apollo's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Class B metahuman was indeed tough to kill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he was finally dead! With his death, Clarissa's engagement would automatically be dissolved, and at least for now, no one would force her into marriage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, a smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I cannot waste his elemental essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, immediately getting to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was a wind elemental metahuman, mastering the wind elemental with remarkable skill. If Osborne had not fused with Devil's Light or transformed into a Vampire, he might not have been able to defeat Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not miss out on Apollo's wind elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye locked onto the residual wind elemental essence within Apollo's body, extracting and absorbing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne felt the power of countless nimble, natural wind elemental in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this, Osborne had absorbed four of the elemental essence, surpassing the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this, Osborne felt no pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I can absorb at least five, even six elemental essence. I wonder how terrifying my Devil's Light will become if all are fused together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was excited. He walked over to Apollo's corpse and picked up the Black Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the sword began to vibrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed alive, vibrating gently. Osborne felt a sharp and eerie powerful force within the sword's blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Chevalier family's ancestral sword? An ancient magic weapon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung it, and a black sword light flashed. A towering tree not far away was instantly cut in half, its broken end was as smooth as a mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such sharpness, such power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. The sword's power far exceeded the alloy dagger he had bought at a high price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the highest-level Class A dagger from the Draco Group is not as sharp as this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, it belongs to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne strapped the sword to his waist. It was his trophy and he had no intention of returning it to the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, Derek watched as Osborne crushed Apollo's head and took the Chevalier family's ancestral sword as a trophy. Derek's body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek roared, his eyes turning blood-red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Apollo was his son. To see his son's head explode in front of him was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying murderous intent erupted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a gust of wind dragged Derek's body, propelling him towards Osborne in the canyon at terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion frowned, seemingly wanting to intervene but ultimately refrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other representatives from the ancient families also did not act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let it be. Apollo is already dead. If we interfere now, Derek might take it out on us. While I am not afraid of him, it is unnecessary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let Derek vent his anger. After all, the Skyefall Security has nothing to do with me. It is just a dog-eat-dog situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion smiled, watching as Derek descended near Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is quite powerful to have killed Apollo. I should thank him. If he had not been killed by Derek, I might recruit him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone on the viewing platform was just watching the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Clarissa, not far away, turned pale with worry as she saw Derek heading towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, save him quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked surprised. "Save him? Clarissa, you overestimate me. Derek is a Class B+ metahuman, and I am only Class C+. If I intervene, Derek can kill me instantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, we do not know him. Why should we save him? He killed your fianc&eacute;, Apollo Chevalier. If we intervene, the Chevalier family would not spare us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa became even more anxious, but she had no solution. Derek was too powerful, and with the ancient family representatives not intervening, no one could stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa cursed herself again, resenting her weakness and inability to help Osborne despite the danger he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne already saw Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying wind elemental power surrounding Derek made Osborne's expression turn serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes were red with fury. Without wasting words, he attacked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will make you pay for my son's death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am going to kill all of you. You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of Derek's hand, several terrifying tornadoes appeared out of nowhere, swirling towards Osborne from all directions. Everything caught in the tornadoes was shredded into tiny fragments and swept away by the gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood-red hair whipped in the wind, and he felt his body struggling to stay upright against the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So strong!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
