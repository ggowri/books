  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the tournament began, every spectator from the various clans was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, a significant portion of their young talents&mdash;at least seventy percent&mdash;had shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were over a hundred young Deity Kings in attendance, and that was just the ones who had made their presence known. Who knew how many more were lurking in the shadows, waiting to make their entrance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Take the Paramount Supreme Clan, for example.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They undoubtedly had many top-tier talents in the mix, yet so far, only Tristram from the Bowman family had stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of their superstars remained hidden, adding to the air of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overall, the gathered clans were bursting with optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings seemed insignificant to them&mdash;just a lowly group of humans. How strong could they really be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their mind, surely, their young geniuses would easily dispatch them, wiping them out without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as the tournament progressed, that confidence began to wane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength displayed by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings was clearly on a different level&mdash;one that far surpassed that of the other clans' super talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when standing at the same realm, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings showcased an undeniable edge, as if they were playing in a different league altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In light of this, the question loomed large. Could the young warriors from the other clans truly defeat the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If no one could beat them in this grand challenge, where would that leave the dignity of the various clans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What right would they have to hold their heads high in front of the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As these thoughts sank in, the atmosphere grew tense. Faces turned serious, and the glimmer of determination morphed into something darker&mdash;murderous intent simmered just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, despite the rising tension, they couldn't act just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All they could do was hope that their young talents would rise to the occasion, reclaiming their honor on the tournament stage and preventing another crushing defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's expression was serious as he stepped forward. "I'll take this next match! Our clans can't keep losing like this. If we go on like this, we'll be the laughingstock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must win the next round! I'm Ambrose, the only mid-stage Deity King present, and it's my responsibility to restore our honor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, any objection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gathered crowd turned their attention to Ambrose, nodding in agreement. No one voiced any objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Ambrose continued, "Let's go! The eight of us will take the stage, and this time, victory is a must!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Ambrose and his seven teammates ascended to the arena, eliciting a collective sigh of relief from the onlooking clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose is in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose, the most legendary talent from the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, is finally stepping up! They say his Thunder Power is incredible, with his elemental essence already at Level Eight! And with his mid-stage Deity King level, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings won't have such an easy victory this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose will reclaim our lost honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, no matter how strong the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are, they'll have to take Ambrose's team seriously! I can't believe they would dare to send just two or three people against him! They must send Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan, too; otherwise, they'll get steamrolled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have no choice but to go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the various spectators buzzed with conversation, Osborne and the others were discussing their strategy for this round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah chimed in, "Let me handle this! Zoe and I can team up; we should be able to hold our own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Hannah and saw the determination in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After considering, he nodded. "Alright! It'll be you and Zoe. But be careful; they're sending a mid-stage Deity King, and the other seven are at the peak of the early stage. This is their strongest team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make sure you each take the Supreme Malevolence Shield and Supreme Malevolence Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah and Zoe nodded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Osborne! Just sit back and watch our performance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the two women exchanged a glance and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they moved to the center of the arena, the crowd erupted in a cacophony of chatter and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are only sending two fighters against Ambrose's team? And one of them is Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are they thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do they seriously believe that just the two of them can take on Ambrose's whole squad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're just courting disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're only early-stage Deity Kings! Even if they're peak early-stage, how could they possibly stand up to mid-stage Deity King Ambrose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogance! Pure arrogance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd seethed with outrage, but the most furious was Ambrose himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had expected that with him in the mix, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, along with Hannah, would go all out for an honest eight-on-eight battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, they'd sent just two of their fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked him more was that they hadn't even fielded their strongest&mdash;Theodore and Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling insulted, Ambrose fixed his gaze on the two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're looking for trouble! Time to end this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
