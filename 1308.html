  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Osborne who was on the move; Divine Shadow and the God of Star were springing into action, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, unlike Osborne, who wielded incredible spatial power and impressive speed, they had no choice but to target a single fleeing Transcendent Deity from the Deschanel Clan each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star set her sights on the youngest member of the Deschanel Clan&mdash;a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel was the only female among them and was now ensnared in a fierce struggle to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Divine Shadow had locked onto the clan leader himself&mdash;Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep-seated grudge fueled Divine Shadow's drive. She saw her chance to keep Terrence trapped and make sure he never got away. With wild desperation in her eyes, she engaged him in a fierce confrontation, not giving him an ounce of room to maneuver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, even if Terrence did manage to break free, it wouldn't matter much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had already pinpointed his energy signature, and unless he could make a beeline for Celestara, it would only take Osborne asking Kendra to re-establish his location for them to hunt him down once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Divine Shadow was itching to finish Terrence off herself, and Osborne wasn't about to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Osborne had just caught up with a third Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This warrior had broken through the encirclement and was racing away with astonishing speed, utterly focused on escape. But no matter how fast he pushed himself, he was still no match for Osborne's spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden movement, Osborne appeared right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" the Deschanel Clan warrior roared, filled with rage, as he realized he'd been cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling the divine power he had been gathering, he tried to blast Osborne away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Stasis! Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he uttered the incantation, energy burst forth from both of Osborne's eyes. In an instant, the warrior found himself frozen in place, his body slowly turning to stone. By the time he regained his senses, Osborne had vanished from his field of vision, only to reappear behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt heavy, almost as if he were sinking in quicksand. Although the warrior had not been fully petrified, his speed was considerably impaired. As Osborne charged from behind, he sensed the threat and desperately tried to evade it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched a brutal kick into his back, sending him sprawling and spitting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even recover, Osborne materialized in his path again, delivering another punishing kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back to where you came from!" Osborne said icily, sending the Transcendent Deity tumbling back as another Blood Demon team swooped in, surrounding him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair seeped into the warrior's eyes as they widened in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne showed no signs of slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven Deschanel Clan members had attempted their escape; now, two were firmly caught by Divine Shadow or God of Star. He had already kicked three back, but two had made it quite a distance away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat must be cut at the roots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no room for anyone from the Deschanel Clan to escape. If even one of them were to survive, they could present a threat in the future&mdash;not just to him but also to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, unleashing his spatial power again to appear right in front of another fleeing Deschanel Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same scenario played out yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This warrior had managed to get pretty far, marking him as one of the strongest among the remaining Transcendent Deities of the Deschanel Clan. In a frontal confrontation, even an Intermediate Deity like Osborne might struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had a toolkit full of tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could use interdimensional travel, Phantom Steps, Temporal Stasis, and the chilling Medusa's Gaze to freeze his opponents in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne lacked the divine power or Divine Body that surpassed his opponents, Osborne still toyed with the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing him could be challenging, but holding him down? That was a cakewalk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he latched onto his target, it wouldn't take long for members of the Blood Demon to arrive and seal the Deschanel Clan warrior's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, all nine Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan had been taken down by the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a large number of Blood Demon fighters now free, they quickly moved to assist their comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation for the remaining Transcendent Deities of the Deschanel Clan was growing increasingly dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, in the meantime, had caught up to the last Transcendent Deity from the Deschanel Clan and blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief struggle, Osborne managed to hold him off until more Blood Demon members arrived, successfully surrounding the final Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't stop there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He joined forces with the Blood Demon members, taking out the encircled Transcendent Deity warriors one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, these Transcendent Deity warriors had already been struggling to fend off the Blood Demon members, and with Osborne now in the mix, their fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were obliterated, their Divine Bodies exploding into flesh and blood in the void, transforming into thick clouds of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body count continued to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne, alongside God of Star and a group of Blood Demon members, finally took down Rachel, only one Transcendent Deity warrior from the Deschanel Clan remained alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence, the clan leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was locked in a fierce battle with Divine Shadow. He couldn't escape, nor could he aid his fellow warriors as he watched them fall one by one at the hands of Osborne and the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes, at that moment, were bloodshot with rage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
