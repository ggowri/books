You go back to being Camille Lewis, and I help you start somewhere new, with a comfortable but ordinary life.&quot; Her voice softened slightly. &quot;There&#x27;s no shame in that choice. But there&#x27;s no revenge in it either.&quot;<br/><br/>The weight of the moment pressed down on me. Step forward or back. Choose power or peace. Become the hunter or remain the hunted.<br/><br/>I opened the box.<br/><br/>Its interior was lined with dark blue velvet. Empty, waiting. Like the future stretching before me, a blank page I could fill however I chose.<br/><br/>With trembling hands, I reached for my purse. Inside was all I had left of my old life. The few things I&#x27;d grabbed before leaving the house that day, plus what Victoria&#x27;s people had collected from my hotel room before staging my &quot;drowning.&quot;<br/><br/>First, my wedding ring. Three carats, princess cut. &quot;Not your style, dear, but it&#x27;s what a Rodriguez wife should wear.&quot; I stared at it, remembering the day Stefan had slid it onto my finger, Rose watching with that secret smile I&#x27;d been too blind to understand.<br/><br/>&quot;Your marriage,&quot; Victoria observed. &quot;Your first major loss.&quot;<br/><br/>I dropped the ring into the box. The sound it made hitting the bottom was strangely final.<br/><br/>Next, the charm bracelet my parents had given me for my sixteenth birthday. Each charm representing some achievement of mine they&#x27;d actually noticed. So few compared to Rose&#x27;s overflowing trophy shelf.<br/><br/>&quot;Your family,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Your deepest wound.&quot;<br/><br/>The bracelet joined the ring.<br/><br/>A small stack of photos came next. Me as a child, before Rose came. The last pictures of when I was enough all by myself. Me at my wedding, smiling so hopefully. A family Christmas, all of us posed perfectly for a card no one would remember receiving.<br/><br/>&quot;Your illusions,&quot; Victoria noted. &quot;The stories you told yourself to survive.&quot;<br/><br/>The photos fluttered into the box like fallen leaves.<br/><br/>Last was my wallet. Inside, my driver&#x27;s license, credit cards, social security card. The official records of Camille Lewis.<br/><br/>&quot;Your identity,&quot; Victoria whispered. &quot;Who they told you to be.&quot;<br/><br/>These too went into the chest. I stood empty-handed now, strange lightness spreading through me.<br/><br/>Victoria produced a small silver key. &quot;Are you certain? Once locked, this chest will be buried here, beside Sophia. Camille Lewis will rest here forever.&quot;<br/><br/>Was I certain? The question echoed in my mind. To lock away not just mementos, but the person I&#x27;d been for twenty-five years. The good sister. The loyal daughter. The loving wife. The woman who always forgave, always understood, always gave second chances.<br/><br/>But what had that earned me? Betrayal. Heartbreak. A sister who orchestrated my humiliation. A husband who discarded me on our anniversary. Parents who always loved their chosen daughter more.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, surprising myself with the steadiness of my voice. &quot;I&#x27;m certain.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria inserted the key, turning it with a soft click. Then she knelt, placing the chest in a small hole already dug beside Sophia&#x27;s headstone.<br/><br/>&quot;Andrew,&quot; she called.<br/><br/>A man in a dark suit stepped forward from the tree line where he&#x27;d been waiting. I hadn&#x27;t even noticed him. He carried a shovel and began covering the box with earth, each thud of dirt making the separation more final.<br/><br/>&quot;In burying Camille Lewis beside my daughter,&quot; Victoria said, watching the box disappear, &quot;we honor both lives cut short by betrayal. Sophia by her fiancé&#x27;s family. You by those who should have treasured you.&quot;<br/><br/>When the last of the dirt was patted smooth and leaves scattered over it to hide the freshly turned earth, Victoria stood tall beside me. Together, we looked down at where pieces of my past now lay buried.<br/><br/>&quot;Now Camille Lewis can truly rest,&quot; Victoria said, &quot;and Camille Kane can rise without anything holding her back.&quot;<br/><br/>I expected to feel grief, or fear, or perhaps regret. Instead, strange calm washed over me. <br/><br/>&quot;When do we begin?&quot; I asked, turning from the grave to face my new reality.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile held approval. &quot;We already have. Your education starts today. Finance, business strategy, social dynamics. Every weapon you&#x27;ll need.&quot;<br/><br/>She handed me her phone, open to a news article. The headline read: &quot;Lewis Family Holds Memorial Service for Daughter Believed Drowned.&quot;<br/><br/>There was a photo, Rose in tasteful black, eyes dramatically red, clutching Stefan&#x27;s arm. My parents looking appropriately devastated. All positioned perfectly for the cameras.<br/><br/>&quot;The first lesson,&quot; Victoria said, watching my reaction closely, &quot;is learning to recognize performance. See how she tilts her head to catch the light? How her hand grips his arm, not for support, but possession? How even in grief, she&#x27;s aware of the camera angles?&quot;<br/><br/>I studied the photo with new eyes, seeing beyond my initial reaction. &quot;She&#x27;s enjoying it,&quot; I realized. &quot;The attention. The sympathy. She&#x27;s the star now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Precisely. And your parents? Notice their posture, the distance between them. Your father&#x27;s hand not quite touching your mother&#x27;s back. What does that tell you?&quot;<br/><br/>I looked closer. &quot;They&#x27;re distant. Going through motions. Maybe... blaming each other?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, pleased. &quot;Grief fractures weak foundations. Their perfect family image is cracking already. By the time we&#x27;re finished, it will be dust.&quot;<br/><br/>She took back her phone, sliding it into her pocket. &quot;Come. We have a meeting with your teachers at noon. Your first public appearance as my daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>As we walked back toward the car, I glanced once more at the twin graves, one marked, one secret. Sophia Elizabeth Kane and Camille Elizabeth Lewis. Both women destroyed by people who should have protected them.<br/><br/>But from those ashes, something new was being formed. Something that wouldn&#x27;t break so easily.<br/><br/>I straightened my shoulders, feeling strength I hadn&#x27;t known I possessed. <br/><br/>&quot;Happy birthday, Camille Kane,&quot; Victoria said as the driver opened our car door. &quot;The world awaits.&quot;<br/><br/>I smiled, feeling the expression settle strangely on my face. Not the smile of the woman I&#x27;d been, eager to please, desperate for approval. But something sharper. More dangerous.<br/><br/>&quot;It won&#x27;t know what hit it,&quot; I promised, sliding into the cool leather interior.<br/><br/>As we drove away, I didn&#x27;t look back at the graves. The past was buried now. Dead and gone.<br/><br/>All that remained was the future. And the reckoning it would bring.<br/><div class="pagination"><a href="10.html">« Prev</a><a href="12.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
