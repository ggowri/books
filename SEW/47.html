News channels began running special segments on the &quot;Rodriguez Collapse,&quot; featuring experts we&#x27;d quietly briefed in advance.<br/><br/>Fresh alerts flooded my screens. Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s board had called an emergency session. Rumors of Stefan&#x27;s possible removal as CEO spread through financial circles. Trading halts triggered then lifted, each resumption bringing another wave of selling.<br/><br/>&quot;Forty percent drop,&quot; Victoria announced with clear satisfaction, pouring two glasses of the eighteen-year-old Macallan she kept in my office for special occasions. &quot;Well done, Camille. Absolutely masterful execution.&quot;<br/><br/>I accepted the glass but didn&#x27;t drink, watching instead as our source continued to provide real-time updates from inside the Rodriguez headquarters.<br/><br/>More messages appeared: *Stefan&#x27;s office being cleared out. Personal items in boxes. Security escorting him from building. Executive team in complete meltdown. Legal team preparing for shareholder lawsuits.*<br/><br/>I stared at the words until they blurred together. Remembered Stefan&#x27;s boyish pride in his family&#x27;s company during our first dates. His passionate late-night talks about modernizing the fleet. The dreams he&#x27;d shared late at night about expanding their legacy across new shipping lanes, new countries, new possibilities. The way his eyes lit up when discussing the business in a way they never quite did when discussing our future together.<br/><br/>All ash now. All destroyed by my hand, methodically, deliberately, without mercy, just as he&#x27;d destroyed me.<br/><br/>&quot;Incoming call from Margaret Lewis,&quot; my assistant announced through the intercom, interrupting my thoughts.<br/><br/>My mother. Probably calling to beg for help with Rose&#x27;s failing fashion line, unaware of the irony. She had no idea she was speaking to her lost daughter while her chosen one&#x27;s world crumbled into dust. I wondered briefly what she would think if she knew the truth, that the daughter she&#x27;d discarded was now powerful enough to crush businesses with a few keystrokes.<br/><br/>&quot;Decline,&quot; I said sharply, watching Rodriguez stock hit another circuit breaker.<br/><br/>Victoria sipped her whiskey, watching me over the rim of her glass with the calculating gaze that had first drawn me to her after my world collapsed. &quot;After this, there will be no going back. You understand that? Once the Rodriguez name is destroyed, many doors will close to you forever.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Those doors closed the moment Stefan and Rose decided to betray me,&quot; I replied, finally tasting the aged whiskey, letting it burn down my throat. &quot;I&#x27;m simply making it official.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The market closes in ten minutes,&quot; Victoria said, glancing at her watch. &quot;Tomorrow we start on their Asia division. By week&#x27;s end...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By week&#x27;s end they&#x27;ll have nothing left,&quot; I cut in, watching each percentage point drop with a hollow satisfaction. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that the point? Complete annihilation?&quot;<br/><br/>On screen, Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s stock hit bottom again. Trading halted for the fourth time. Stefan&#x27;s legacy ended not with a bang but with a whimper and a lot of red numbers. The five-year chart showed a perfect cliff edge, everything before today rendered meaningless.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed one final time. A photo from our source, Stefan being escorted out, box of personal items in his arms, face pale with shock and disbelief. The golden boy finally facing consequences. The heir apparent dethroned. The man who had promised me forever now facing his own sudden ending.<br/><br/>I&#x27;d done this. Me. The woman he&#x27;d discarded like yesterday&#x27;s news. The wife he&#x27;d betrayed with her own sister. The inconvenient obstacle to his true desires.<br/><br/>So why didn&#x27;t victory taste sweeter? Why did the whiskey turn bitter on my tongue? Why did the emptiness inside seem to grow rather than diminish?<br/><br/>Victoria studied me carefully, her years of experience reading people picking up on my unexpected hesitation. &quot;You&#x27;re not having second thoughts, are you? After everything we&#x27;ve done to get here?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not second thoughts,&quot; I said, setting down my glass. &quot;Just wondering what comes after.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;After?&quot; Victoria raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow. &quot;After this, we continue with the plan. Rose&#x27;s fashion empire. Your mother&#x27;s social standing. One by one, we dismantle everything they value, everything they chose over you.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded slowly, but something inside me questioned whether endless destruction would ever fill the void their betrayal had created. &quot;And then what? When it&#x27;s all gone, what remains for me?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s sigh held years of experience, both professional and personal. &quot;Just remember why we started this. What they did to you. What they deserve. How they would have continued using you if you hadn&#x27;t discovered the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I remember everything,&quot; I said softly, touching the screen where Stefan&#x27;s broken expression was captured forever. &quot;That&#x27;s the problem.&quot;<br/><br/>The final trading bell rang, the sound echoing through my office like a death knell. Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s stock closed down sixty-two percent, the worst single-day performance in the company&#x27;s century-long history. Headlines already proclaimed the death of a shipping dynasty that had survived wars, depressions, and global crises, but couldn&#x27;t survive my vengeance.<br/><br/>I&#x27;d won. Thoroughly. Completely. Just as planned.<br/><br/>My phone began buzzing incessantly, financial reporters seeking comment, business associates offering congratulations, vultures seeking to pick at the Rodriguez carcass. I silenced it without looking at the names.<br/><br/>Tomorrow would bring new targets, new strategies, new victories. But tonight... tonight I would sit alone with my thoughts, the taste of ash in my mouth despite the expensive whiskey, and consider what exactly came after revenge. When all the destruction was complete, when everyone who had hurt me was brought low, what would I build from the ruins of my former life?<br/><br/>It was a question I hadn&#x27;t allowed myself to consider until now, focused solely on tearing down rather than building up. Perhaps it was time to start thinking beyond vengeance, beyond the all-consuming fire that had driven me these past months.<br/><br/>Perhaps there was something waiting for me on the other side of revenge.<br/><div class="pagination"><a href="46.html">« Prev</a><a href="48.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
