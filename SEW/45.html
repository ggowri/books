The sound of shattering glass matched the chaos in his mind. Forty percent. His company stock had dropped forty percent in a single day. Billions wiped out in hours.<br/><br/>His phone kept buzzing,  board members, investors, his father. All demanding answers he didn&#x27;t have. How had Kane Industries outmaneuvered them so completely? The takeover of Pacific Maritime shouldn&#x27;t have been possible. Their defenses had been solid. Their contracts secured.<br/><br/>Yet here he sat, watching his family&#x27;s legacy crumble through real-time stock updates on his phone screen. Each notification drove the knife deeper.<br/><br/>&quot;Darling?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice drifted through his office door. &quot;Can we talk about the wedding plans? The planner needs final numbers for-&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not now.&quot; His voice came out harsh, rough from hours of emergency calls.<br/><br/>She entered anyway, dressed for the evening in a red designer dress that probably cost more than his employees made in a month. &quot;The venue won&#x27;t hold our date forever. We need to confirm...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The date?&quot; Stefan spun to face her, rage boiling over. &quot;You want to discuss wedding dates while my company burns? While everything my family built over generations disappears?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stepped back, unused to seeing this side of him. &quot;The business troubles are temporary. Your father will...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;My father?&quot; He laughed, a bitter sound that scared even himself. &quot;My father hasn&#x27;t returned my calls since the stock crash. The board is meeting tomorrow to discuss my removal as CEO. And you want to talk about flower arrangements?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, please.&quot; She moved toward him, reaching for his arm. &quot;We&#x27;ll figure this out. Kane Industries can&#x27;t...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries.&quot; The name tasted like poison on his tongue. &quot;That woman... there&#x27;s something about her. Something familiar that I can&#x27;t place.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille Kane? Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. She&#x27;s lived in Europe most of her life. We only met her recently at...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know what she told us!&quot; His fist slammed the desk, making Rose jump. &quot;But every time I see her, every time she speaks... it&#x27;s like a memory I can&#x27;t quite grab.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s expression shifted, something calculating replacing her previous concern. &quot;Perhaps you&#x27;re attracted to her? It would explain your obsession.&quot;<br/><br/>The suggestion hit him like ice water. &quot;This isn&#x27;t about attraction. This is about our entire future disappearing while you plan parties and pick out china patterns!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Our future depends on maintaining appearances,&quot; Rose snapped back. &quot;The right wedding, the right guests, the right connections....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Connections?&quot; Stefan advanced on her, forcing her to step back. &quot;Is that what I am to you? A connection? A stepping stone for your social climbing?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t be absurd. I love you. I&#x27;ve always...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Always?&quot; Another harsh laugh. &quot;You mean since London? Since you came back and found me married to your sister?&quot;<br/><br/>The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken accusations. Rose&#x27;s face paled slightly.<br/><br/>&quot;We agreed not to discuss Camille,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Not after... everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Everything.&quot; Stefan turned away, unable to look at her. &quot;Such a nice, clean word for what happened. For what we did.&quot;<br/><br/>His phone buzzed again. Another stock alert. Another drop. The numbers blurred before his eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;We should postpone the wedding announcement,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Until the company stabilizes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Postpone?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice rose sharply. &quot;We can&#x27;t postpone! The society papers already...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Damn the society papers!&quot; He whirled back to face her. &quot;Don&#x27;t you understand? I&#x27;m losing everything! My position, my family&#x27;s respect, my entire future! And all you care about is your precious social standing?&quot;<br/><br/>Tears filled her eyes, but Stefan had seen her cry too many times to trust them now. &quot;That&#x27;s unfair. I&#x27;m trying to help...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Help?&quot; His voice dropped dangerously low. &quot;Like you helped Camille? Is that the kind of help you&#x27;re offering?&quot;<br/><br/>The color drained from Rose&#x27;s face. For a moment, real fear flickered in her eyes. &quot;You promised never to bring that up.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m breaking a lot of promises lately.&quot; Stefan moved to his bar, reaching for another glass. &quot;Seems to run in our relationship.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose watched him pour, her perfectly manicured nails digging into her palms. &quot;What do you want me to say? That I&#x27;m sorry? That I wish things had been different?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want you to care!&quot; The words exploded from him. &quot;Care about something real! Something beyond your next social event or magazine feature!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I care about you,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you?&quot; He met her eyes in the bar&#x27;s mirror. &quot;Or do you care about what I represent? The name, the position, the lifestyle?&quot;<br/><br/>She had no answer. Or perhaps, her silence was answer enough.<br/><br/>&quot;Go home, Rose.&quot; Stefan drained his glass in one swallow. &quot;I need to work. Need to find some way to save what&#x27;s left of my company while I still can.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, please....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go.&quot; He didn&#x27;t turn around. Couldn&#x27;t bear to see whatever performance she&#x27;d prepared. &quot;We&#x27;ll discuss the wedding... later.&quot;<br/><br/>Her heels clicked across his office floor, each step precise despite her emotional display. At the door, she paused.<br/><br/>&quot;I do love you,&quot; she said softly. &quot;In my way.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan kept his eyes on the city lights beyond his window. &quot;Your way,&quot; he replied, equally soft. &quot;That&#x27;s always been the problem, hasn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br/><br/>The door closed behind her with a quiet click. In the sudden silence, his phone buzzed one final time. After-hours trading in Asia pushing his stock even lower.<br/><br/>He poured another drink, mind returning to Camille Kane. To that nagging sense of recognition. To the way she&#x27;d looked at him across the conference room, like she could see right through him.<br/><br/>Like she knew all his secrets.<br/><br/>Like she knew him.<br/><br/>The thought sent a chill down his spine that not even expensive scotch could warm.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="44.html">« Prev</a><a href="46.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
