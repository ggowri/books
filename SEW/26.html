A woman&#x27;s size seven pump, once black, now gray-green from three months underwater. The heel had broken off, but the designer&#x27;s red sole remained visible. Louboutin. Unmistakably Camille&#x27;s.<br/><br/>&quot;Is this your sister&#x27;s shoe, Ms. Lewis?&quot; Detective Ramirez asked, his tired eyes watching my reaction carefully.<br/><br/>I reached for it with trembling fingers, a calculated tremor I&#x27;d practiced thatmorning. &quot;Yes,&quot; I whispered, voice breaking on cue. &quot;She wore these the last time I saw her. A gift from our parents for her birthday.&quot;<br/><br/>The lie slid out smoothly. In truth, I&#x27;d given Camille those shoes when she landed her first job, playing the generous big sister while privately mocking her pathetic excitement over my hand-me-downs.<br/><br/>&quot;Does seeing this personal item bring up any new thoughts about your sister&#x27;s state of mind before her disappearance?&quot;<br/><br/>An interesting question. Not &quot;accident&quot; or &quot;drowning,&quot; but &quot;disappearance.&quot; The detective&#x27;s word choice revealed his lingering doubts.<br/><br/>&quot;Your parents mentioned Camille kept journals,&quot; he continued. &quot;Have you had a chance to read them?&quot;<br/><br/>So Mom had spoken to the police about the journals. This was worse than I thought.<br/><br/>&quot;I... I couldn&#x27;t bear to read them,&quot; I said, looking away as if overcome. &quot;Too painful. Mom mentioned she found some, but she&#x27;s been very private about their contents.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And your relationship with Mr. Rodriguez? Your sister&#x27;s ex-husband?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan and I have found comfort in our shared grief,&quot; I said carefully. &quot;We were friends before he and Camille dated. After a respectful period of mourning, we&#x27;ve... reconnected.&quot;<br/><br/>After leaving the station, I called Martin Greene, the family&#x27;s trusted fixer. &quot;I need everything you can get on Detective Ramirez. And I need to know exactly what my mother told the police about Camille&#x27;s journals.&quot;<br/><br/>Then I headed to my parents&#x27; house. Mom was at her weekly therapy appointment, an engagement I&#x27;d encouraged to keep her sedated with grief counseling and antidepressants.<br/><br/>The house was quiet when I arrived. I moved through Camille&#x27;s room methodically, checking obvious hiding places. Nothing. The floorboard Mom had mentioned yielded nothing but an empty space.<br/><br/>Mom&#x27;s private sitting room, then. The small sunlit space where she spent hours alone. On her writing desk sat a mahogany box with a brass lock.<br/><br/>&quot;Looking for something?&quot;<br/><br/>Mom&#x27;s voice from the doorway froze me in place. She stood watching me, more sober and alert than I&#x27;d seen in months.<br/><br/>&quot;Mom,&quot; I said, forcing warmth into my voice. &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect you back so soon.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the box, unlocked it, and withdrew a journal. &quot;September 14th, ten years ago: &#x27;Rose told Jason I stuffed my bra before the dance. Now he won&#x27;t talk to me. She says she was just joking, but she smiles when she thinks I&#x27;m not looking.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>My mind raced back. Jason Parker, Camille&#x27;s first crush. I&#x27;d spent weeks helping her get his attention, only to whisper that carefully crafted lie at precisely the right moment.<br/><br/>&quot;Teenage drama,&quot; I said dismissively. &quot;Camille was always sensitive.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom took out another journal. &quot;April 2nd, eight years ago: &#x27;Got my Stanford acceptance today. Rose says it&#x27;s probably a mistake. Now I can&#x27;t stop worrying they&#x27;ll realize they didn&#x27;t mean to accept me.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I was trying to protect her from disappointment,&quot; I protested. &quot;Stanford is highly competitive.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom slammed the journal shut. &quot;You know what happened next? She called the admissions office to &#x27;confirm&#x27; they wanted her. They thought she was having a mental health crisis. When we decided she wasn&#x27;t ready for college, based largely on your concerns about her emotional stability, that call reinforced our decision.&quot;<br/><br/>Time for the nuclear option.<br/><br/>&quot;Mom,&quot; I whispered, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to tell you this, but... Camille had problems none of us understood. The last time we spoke, she said things that frightened me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What things?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She talked about hearing voices sometimes. About feeling watched.&quot; The lies flowed smoothly, tailored to match symptoms I knew Mom feared. Her own mother had suffered from paranoid delusions.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not possible,&quot; Mom said, but doubt had crept into her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;Would she write about it if she was hiding it? Mom, I&#x27;ve been carrying this guilt for months, wondering if I should have told someone. If I could have prevented what happened.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When her car went into the river,&quot; I continued softly, &quot;I wondered if... if it wasn&#x27;t an accident. If maybe the voices told her to do it.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom sank into her chair, face ashen. &quot;I should have known. A mother should know when her child is suffering.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You couldn&#x27;t have known,&quot; I soothed, watching my carefully crafted lies take root. &quot;Camille was good at hiding things.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I need to tell your father. And the detective.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are you sure that&#x27;s wise?&quot; I asked gently. &quot;Camille wanted this kept private. And mental health stigma is still so prevalent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps wait,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Read through the journals again, looking for signs you might have missed. Let me help you,&quot; I offered, reaching for the box. &quot;Two sets of eyes might catch what one misses.&quot;<br/><br/>She hesitated only briefly before nodding. The box of journals, the evidence I&#x27;d been desperate to secure, was now being handed to me willingly.<br/><br/>When I left an hour later, Mom looked lighter somehow. The poison of suspicion had been drained, replaced with a new narrative that absolved her of responsibility while redirecting her focus from me to Camille&#x27;s fabricated mental health struggles.<br/><br/>In the car, I immediately texted Martin: *Cancel the Ramirez investigation. Situation contained.*<br/><br/>Looking at the mahogany box beside me, I felt a surge of satisfaction. By tonight, any evidence of my careful dismantling of Camille&#x27;s life would be ashes. And the official narrative would shift subtly, not an accident, not murder, but a troubled young woman&#x27;s final desperate act.<br/><br/>Perfect Rose, the devoted sister, carrying her tragic secret to protect her family&#x27;s peace of mind. The story practically wrote itself. Mental illness was such a convenient explanation for inconvenient truths. Camille&#x27;s real voice had been silenced forever in that river. Now I would ensure that even her written words told the story I chose for them to tell.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="25.html">« Prev</a><a href="27.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
