Each monitor told part of the story, stock prices, trading volumes, news alerts, social media sentiment, competitor reactions, and internal communications we&#x27;d managed to intercept. One year of meticulous preparation leading to this pivotal moment. The leather of my executive chair creaked softly as I leaned forward, my reflection in the darkened glass showing a woman I sometimes barely recognized.<br/><br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; Victoria asked from the doorway, her tailored charcoal suit as impeccable as always. Her eyes gleamed with the predatory anticipation I&#x27;d come to recognize over our months working together.<br/><br/>&quot;Everything&#x27;s in position.&quot; I pulled up the final numbers, watching as our algorithms predicted the coming cascade. &quot;Our traders are standing by in London, New York, and Singapore. The evidence of Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s safety violations hits the press in exactly four minutes and twenty-three seconds.&quot; <br/><br/>She moved to stand behind my chair, studying the screens with the careful attention of a general reviewing battle plans. Her subtle perfume, always jasmine with notes of sandalwood, filled the air between us. &quot;And the backup plan?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Three different whistleblowers will contact financial reporters about questionable accounting practices at precisely staggered intervals. The evidence has already been planted in their internal systems, backdated appropriately, and verified by our technical team.&quot; I tapped a sequence on my keyboard, bringing up another window showing the pre-written exposés. &quot;If they somehow weather the safety scandal, the financial improprieties will finish them.&quot;<br/><br/>My hands stayed steady as I typed final commands into the trading system, muscle memory from countless simulations we&#x27;d run. Inside, emotions warred, satisfaction, pain, a strange kind of grief for the company I&#x27;d once thought would be mine to help run, alongside the family I thought would become my own. The diamond on my left hand had been gone for months now, but sometimes I still felt its phantom weight.<br/><br/>&quot;First article just dropped,&quot; Victoria noted as alerts started flashing across the primary monitor. &quot;Wall Street Journal. &#x27;Major Safety Concerns Plague Rodriguez Shipping Fleet: Internal Documents Reveal Years of Neglect.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>I allowed myself a small, controlled smile as other notifications followed in rapid succession. Reuters. Bloomberg. Financial Times. CNBC breaking news. Each one sharing damaging details we&#x27;d carefully leaked through untraceable channels. Each one driving the stock price lower, triggering automated sell algorithms across institutional investors&#x27; systems.<br/><br/>&quot;Trading volume spiking,&quot; my head trader reported through the speaker, his voice betraying the excitement he was trying to contain. &quot;Up four hundred percent above normal. Major institutional investors starting to sell. BlackRock just dumped twelve percent of their position.&quot;<br/><br/>On my main screen, Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s stock chart turned bright red, the downward trajectory steepening with each passing second. Down five percent. Then twelve. Then twenty. A freefall gaining speed with every passing minute, accelerated by high-frequency trading programs reacting to the negative press.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed – a message from our source inside the company: *Total chaos here. Stefan locked in emergency board meeting. Conference room screens showing stock collapse. His father just arrived looking furious. Security doubled on executive floor.*<br/><br/>&quot;Time for phase two,&quot; Victoria said quietly, a manicured nail tapping the edge of my desk in perfect rhythm with the declining stock ticker.<br/><br/>I nodded, sending the encrypted signal to our trading team positioned around the globe. Kane Industries would start quietly buying shares through a complex network of shell companies, but only after driving the price down further. By day&#x27;s end, we&#x27;d own enough to demand board seats, placing us in the perfect position to dismantle the company from within.<br/><br/>More alerts filled my screens in a cascade of digital destruction. Industry analysts questioning the company&#x27;s future viability. Suppliers nervously reviewing contracts. Customers making backup plans with competitors. Credit agencies placing Rodriguez Shipping on watch for potential downgrade.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty percent drop,&quot; Victoria noted with undisguised satisfaction, her reflection in my monitor showing the slight smile she reserved for victories. &quot;The margin calls will start soon. Their creditors won&#x27;t wait.&quot;<br/><br/>She was right. Rodriguez Shipping had leveraged their assets heavily for the Asian expansion Stefan had championed against his father&#x27;s wishes. As the stock price fell, their loan covenants would trigger, forcing immediate repayment. A cascade of financial disaster we&#x27;d carefully engineered, exploiting the hidden weaknesses I&#x27;d learned about during intimate dinners and family meetings.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again: *Stefan&#x27;s father just walked out of the board meeting. Never seen him so angry. Screaming about family legacy destroyed. Three generations of work ruined. Stefan looks shell-shocked. CFO in tears.*<br/><br/>I should have felt only triumph. This was what I&#x27;d planned, systematic destruction of everything Stefan valued. But memories kept intruding unbidden. His father&#x27;s pride when giving me a tour of their flagship vessels. Family dinners where he&#x27;d treated me like the daughter he never had. All fake, all conditional on me being the perfect wife to his perfect son. All dissolved the moment I became inconvenient, unnecessary, replaceable.<br/><br/>A notification from our banking contacts appeared: *Rodriguez seeking emergency credit line. Multiple rejections already.*<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane?&quot; My assistant&#x27;s voice through the intercom, professional as always despite the financial bloodbath playing out on our screens. &quot;Mr. Rodriguez Senior is attempting to contact you directly. He&#x27;s called three times in the last five minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes narrowed slightly. &quot;Desperation sets in quickly.&quot;<div class="pagination"><a href="45.html">« Prev</a><a href="47.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
