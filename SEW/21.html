My driver took me to my parents&#x27; house for our weekly family dinner, a tradition I&#x27;d insisted on continuing &quot;to help us heal together.&quot;<br/><br/>In reality, these dinners served to monitor my parents, manage the family narrative, and remind everyone of my central role in holding things together post-tragedy. Tonight, however, I dreaded facing Mom&#x27;s suspicious eyes.<br/><br/>The house looked the same as always, manicured lawn, gleaming windows, tasteful luxury evident in every detail. The home I&#x27;d been brought to fourteen years ago, plucked from the foster system into privilege. The home where I&#x27;d systematically established my dominance over every aspect of family life.<br/><br/>Helen, the housekeeper, opened the door before I could ring the bell. &quot;They&#x27;re in the sitting room, Miss Rose. Your mother&#x27;s had... a difficult day.&quot;<br/><br/> Mom was drinking again. Perfect. An inebriated mother was easier to manage than a suspicious one.<br/><br/>I found them exactly as expected—Dad with a financial report, pretending to work while actually hiding; Mom on her third martini, staring at nothing. The picture of a family fractured by loss.<br/><br/>&quot;Evening,&quot; I said brightly, kissing each of their cheeks. &quot;Helen&#x27;s cooking smells amazing.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom looked up, eyes slightly unfocused. &quot;You&#x27;re late.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Investor meeting ran long. Good news, though, we&#x27;ve secured funding for the international expansion.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad attempted a smile. &quot;That&#x27;s wonderful, princess. Your business acumen never ceases to amaze me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille&#x27;s shoe,&quot; Mom said abruptly, the non sequitur hanging awkwardly in the air. &quot;Richard told you?&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, settling into an armchair across from her. &quot;Yes. I&#x27;m going to the station tomorrow to identify it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I should go.&quot; Her voice hardened. &quot;I&#x27;m her mother.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re in no condition,&quot; Dad muttered, not looking up from his papers. &quot;Rose will handle it.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom&#x27;s laugh was bitter, cutting. &quot;Rose handles everything, doesn&#x27;t she? So capable. So composed. Never a hair out of place, even when discussing her sister&#x27;s remains.&quot;<br/><br/>The accusation in her tone was unmistakable. I kept my expression neutral, concerned but steady. &quot;Mom, I know this is difficult. But falling apart won&#x27;t bring Camille back. Someone needs to stay strong for this family.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This family.&quot; She snorted, taking another sip of her drink. &quot;What family? My daughter is dead. My husband buries himself in work rather than face his grief. And you...&quot;<br/><br/>She trailed off, studying me with eyes suddenly sharper than her intoxication suggested.<br/><br/>&quot;And I what?&quot; I asked softly.<br/><br/>The moment stretched, tension crackling between us. For an instant, I thought she might actually say it, the suspicion I&#x27;d seen growing in her gaze over recent weeks. The doubt that had prompted her to hire a private investigator.<br/><br/>But Dad intervened, setting aside his papers with forced cheer. &quot;Let&#x27;s eat, shall we? No sense letting Helen&#x27;s cooking go cold.&quot;<br/><br/>Dinner was excruciating, Mom alternating between silent glaring and pointed barbs, Dad attempting desperately to maintain normal conversation, me navigating the minefield with practiced ease. By dessert, I was mentally exhausted.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking,&quot; Mom said as Helen served coffee, &quot;about Camille&#x27;s journals.&quot;<br/><br/>I froze, cup halfway to my lips. &quot;Journals?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She kept them since childhood. Hidden in that loose floorboard in her closet, though she thought I didn&#x27;t know.&quot; Mom&#x27;s eyes never left my face. &quot;Interesting reading.&quot;<br/><br/>Ice filled my veins. Camille&#x27;s journals. The private thoughts of a girl who saw more than she let on, who might have documented suspicions, patterns, manipulations over the years. Things I definitely didn&#x27;t want exposed.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve been reading her private thoughts?&quot; I infused my voice with gentle shock. &quot;Mom, that seems... invasive. Wouldn&#x27;t Camille want her privacy respected, even now?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Mom sipped her coffee, eyes never leaving mine. &quot;But they&#x27;ve given me such insight into her state of mind in those final weeks. Her concerns about her marriage. Her doubts about certain relationships.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Margaret, is this appropriate dinner conversation?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When is it appropriate to discuss our daughter&#x27;s death, Richard? When is it convenient to question why her body was never found? When should we examine why she drove to that bridge on a night she was supposed to be meeting you?&quot; She pointed a slightly unsteady finger at me.<br/><br/>There it was. The accusation I&#x27;d been sensing. The dangerous question.<br/><br/>&quot;I told the police,&quot; I said calmly, &quot;Camille canceled our dinner plans at the last minute. Said she wasn&#x27;t feeling well. I assumed she went home.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, that&#x27;s what you told them.&quot; Mom&#x27;s voice was dangerously quiet. &quot;But her journal entry that day says she was excited about your dinner. About reconnecting with her sister after all the &#x27;misunderstandings&#x27; about Stefan.&quot;<br/><br/>My mouth went dry. Damn Camille and her pathetic journaling habit.<br/><br/>&quot;People change their minds, Mom. Maybe she wrote that earlier in the day, before she started feeling unwell.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Mom set down her cup with deliberate care. &quot;Or maybe something else happened. Something that drove her to that bridge. Or someone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Margaret!&quot; Dad&#x27;s voice was sharp with warning. &quot;You can&#x27;t possibly be suggesting...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not suggesting anything.&quot; She stood, swaying slightly. &quot;I&#x27;m simply a mother with questions about her daughter&#x27;s death. Questions our other daughter seems strangely reluctant to explore.&quot;<div class="pagination"><a href="20.html">« Prev</a><a href="22.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
