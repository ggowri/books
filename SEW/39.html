What Victoria had crafted me to show. Alexander Pierce had somehow looked past all of that to the woman beneath, the woman I thought was safely buried.<br/><br/>I showered, letting hot water wash away the last traces of tonight&#x27;s performance, then changed into silk pajamas and moved to the sitting area of my suite. Sleep would be impossible with my mind in such turmoil. Instead, I poured a small glass of bourbon from the decanter on my side table, a habit adopted from Victoria, and curled into the window seat overlooking the grounds.<br/><br/>The estate spread below me, perfectly manicured gardens now shadowed in moonlight, security lights marking the perimeter in the distance. Beyond the gates, the city glowed against the night sky, millions of lives unfolding in patterns I would never know.<br/><br/>*&quot;I suspect we&#x27;ll be seeing more of each other, Ms. Kane.&quot;*<br/><br/>His words played in my mind, the confidence in them suggesting he&#x27;d already decided our paths would cross again. Not a hope or a plan, but a certainty. As if he knew something about the future that I didn&#x27;t.<br/><br/>The bourbon warmed my throat as I sipped it, the expensive liquor tasting of oak and vanilla and something deeper, something that reminded me of how Pierce had smelled standing close to me, expensive cologne with notes of cedar and leather underlying it.<br/><br/>I frowned, annoyed at myself for noticing such details, for remembering them, for finding them pleasant rather than irrelevant. Victoria had trained me better than this. Physical reactions were to be noted, cataloged, and dismissed if they served no strategic purpose.<br/><br/>And yet.<br/><br/>And yet, something about Alexander Pierce had awakened feelings I thought dead along with Camille Lewis. Not romantic interest, nothing so simple or benign. More a deep-seated curiosity, a pull toward something or someone who presented a genuine mystery in a world I&#x27;d come to understand as ruled by patterns and calculations.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed softly on the table beside me. A message from Victoria: *Security briefing, 7 AM. Research team gathering information on Pierce. Sleep if you can.*<br/><br/>The clinical tone was typical of her, emotions relegated to background noise against the forward march of strategic planning. I sent back a simple acknowledgment, then set the phone aside, returning my attention to the moonlit gardens and the thoughts I couldn&#x27;t quite organize.<br/><br/>What would Alexander Pierce do next? The question demanded consideration. If he truly believed I was Camille Lewis, resurrected and transformed, what purpose would that knowledge serve for him? Leverage against Victoria, perhaps? A business advantage of some kind?<br/><br/>Or was his interest more personal? I&#x27;d caught something in his expression beyond mere strategic calculation. A curiosity that mirrored my own, perhaps. An interest that transcended whatever game he might be playing with Victoria.<br/><br/>His words was it a promise, or was it a threat? lingered in my mind as I finished my bourbon and prepared for bed. Sleep would be difficult to find tonight, but tomorrow would demand full focus. Victoria would have a plan, a counter-strategy against whatever threat Pierce presented. She always did.<br/><br/>As I slid between silk sheets, my mind refused to quiet, images from the evening playing behind closed eyelids. The glittering ballroom. The assessing eyes of the social elite. Victoria&#x27;s carefully orchestrated introductions.<br/><br/>And Alexander Pierce, looking at me with those penetrating gray eyes, seeing what no one else had managed to see beneath the careful construction of Camille Kane.<br/><br/>Was it fear I felt at that prospect, or something dangerously close to relief?<br/><br/>The question followed me into uneasy dreams where I ran through endless corridors, pursued by shadows with piercing gray eyes. Dreams where I stood before mirrors that reflected not my current face but the one I&#x27;d left behind. Dreams where Alexander Pierce whispered my old name, over and over, until I turned to face him, only to find myself waking with a start, heart pounding in the darkness of my room.<br/><br/>Dawn found me at my window again, watching the first light touch the gardens below. I&#x27;d managed perhaps three hours of broken sleep, not nearly enough for the day ahead, but more than I&#x27;d expected given the turmoil in my mind.<br/><br/>I showered again, dressed in the power suit laid out by my stylist, applied makeup with practiced precision. Each action a step in the daily transformation from private self to public persona. By the time I checked my reflection before heading to breakfast, Camille Kane stared back at me, confident, controlled, composed.<br/><br/>No trace remained of the confusion and uncertainty that had plagued me through the night. No hint of the dreams that had disturbed my sleep. Just the woman Victoria had created, the heir to her empire, the instrument of justice against those who had wronged me.<div class="pagination"><a href="38.html">« Prev</a><a href="40.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
