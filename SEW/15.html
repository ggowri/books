A white cloth covered the full-length mirror. The doctor positioned me carefully, standing slightly behind my right shoulder.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; she said gently, &quot;what you see today is still healing. There&#x27;s swelling, bruising. The final results won&#x27;t be visible for weeks. But you&#x27;ll get a first impression of your new appearance.&quot;<br/><br/>With that, she pulled away the cloth.<br/><br/>I gasped.<br/><br/>The woman in the mirror was me, but not me. My face but enhanced in ways that transformed my entire appearance. My cheekbones cast elegant shadows beneath them, giving my face a sculpted quality it had never possessed before. My jawline looked stronger, more defined. My brows arched slightly higher, making my eyes appear larger, more commanding.<br/><br/>Even through residual swelling and faint bruising, I could see the changes Dr. Torres had created. Subtle individually, powerful collectively. My lips had a new definition, not obviously augmented but somehow more present. My nose, always slightly crooked from a childhood fall, now had a perfect straight bridge.<br/><br/>I raised a hand to my face, watching my reflection do the same. The stranger in the mirror touched her cheek with trembling fingers.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you think?&quot; Dr. Torres asked quietly.<br/><br/>Words failed me. This new face looked... strong. Confident. The kind of face that belonged on magazine covers or in boardrooms. The kind of face people remembered.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s...&quot; I swallowed hard. &quot;I hardly recognize myself.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s partly the swelling,&quot; Dr. Torres assured me. &quot;And partly the shock of change. Your brain needs time to adjust to the new image. In a few weeks, this will feel like you. The real you.&quot;<br/><br/>But which me was real? The woman I&#x27;d been before, or this new creation designed for power?<br/><br/>Victoria stepped forward, studying my reflection with critical eyes. Then, something rare happened, she smiled. A genuine expression of approval that transformed her usually stern face.<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect,&quot; she said simply. &quot;Exactly what we needed.&quot;<br/><br/>Something warm bloomed in my chest at her approval, a feeling I immediately tried to suppress. I shouldn&#x27;t crave her validation this way. Shouldn&#x27;t feel this rush of pleasure at her acceptance. Yet I did.<br/><br/>Dr. Torres detailed the continuing care routine, medications, specialized skincare, follow-up appointments. I listened with half an ear, still captivated by the stranger in the mirror who now wore my expressions.<br/><br/>Later, after Victoria and Dr. Torres had gone, I sat alone in the recovery suite, lights dimmed as evening fell. Every few minutes, I found myself reaching for the small hand mirror beside my bed, checking to see if the face I&#x27;d seen earlier was still there. Still mine.<br/><br/>Each time, those new eyes looked back at me, harder, sharper, more penetrating than the eyes I&#x27;d known all my life. Eyes that no longer pleaded for love or acceptance. Eyes that demanded respect.<br/><br/>As night deepened, exhaustion finally pulled me toward sleep. But as consciousness faded, images began forming in the darkness behind my eyelids. Dreams taking shape, vivid and disturbing.<br/><br/>I stood on a bridge, rain pouring down around me. Below, dark water churned angrily. Across from me stood Rose, her perfect face contorted with fear. Between us, a broken railing gaped like an open mouth.<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Rose begged, backing away from me. &quot;Camille, please, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen like this!&quot;<br/><br/>In the dream, I moved toward her, my new face reflected in her terrified eyes. She kept retreating until her back hit the damaged railing. It creaked ominously.<br/><br/>&quot;You took everything from me,&quot; dream-me said, voice cold as the rain drenching us both. &quot;My husband. My family. My life.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry!&quot; Rose cried, genuine terror in her voice as the railing began giving way behind her. &quot;I&#x27;ll fix it! I&#x27;ll make it right!&quot;<br/><br/>But it was too late. The railing snapped. Rose screamed as she fell backward, hands grasping empty air. I watched her plummet toward the dark water below, her scream cutting off as she hit the surface and disappeared beneath the churning waves.<br/><br/>I should have felt horror. Should have rushed to the edge, called for help, tried to save her. Instead, dream-me smiled, satisfied, as Rose&#x27;s hands broke the surface once, twice, then disappeared for good.<br/><br/>I woke with a gasp, heart racing, sheets tangled around my legs. The dream had felt so real, the rain on my skin, the sound of the railing breaking, Rose&#x27;s scream as she fell. But what disturbed me most wasn&#x27;t the dream itself.<br/><br/>It was how I felt about it.<br/><br/>I hadn&#x27;t wanted to save my sister. I had wanted to watch her drown.<br/><br/>The realization sent me stumbling to the bathroom, where I splashed cold water on my face, my new face, before looking up at my reflection in the mirror. In the harsh bathroom light, with water dripping from my chin, I barely recognized myself anymore.<br/><br/>Not just because of the surgical changes, the swelling, the bruises fading to yellow. Something in my eyes had changed too. Something harder, colder. Something that had watched Rose drown in my dream and felt nothing but satisfaction.<div class="pagination"><a href="14.html">« Prev</a><a href="16.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
