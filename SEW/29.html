I chose not to share this information, partly because I was still deciding how best to use such an unexpected blessing, but mostly because I needed to understand its power without influence from others.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>I dug my fingernails into my palms. Even in presumed death, Camille was judging us.<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;The money gave me freedom I never expected to have. Freedom to consider who I really was outside of other people&#x27;s expectations and manipulations. Freedom to make choices based on my own values rather than seeking approval.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>My gaze flicked to Stefan, who looked physically ill. Had he known about the money when he signed those divorce papers?<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;I have chosen to direct my inheritance to help girls who lack the family support structure I was fortunate enough to have. The Lighthouse Foundation specifically assists young women transitioning from foster care to independent living. The Cedar Hill estate will be converted into a residential campus for their programs.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>Something cold settled in my stomach. Foster care. Of all the charities, she&#x27;d selected one helping girls from the system I&#x27;d escaped. Was it coincidence, or had she somehow known?<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;To my parents, thank you for the security and opportunities you provided. This decision isn&#x27;t a rejection of you, but rather an attempt to extend similar advantages to those without your resources.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>Dad&#x27;s jaw tightened. Mom resumed her quiet crying.<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;To Stefan, I&#x27;ve returned your grandmother&#x27;s ring not out of bitterness, but because family legacies should continue with true commitment.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;And to Rose, my sister by choice if not by blood, I leave my journals with hope rather than malice. In them, you&#x27;ll find the unfiltered thoughts of someone who spent years trying to understand you, to love you despite the distance you maintained between us. Perhaps in reading them, you&#x27;ll finally see me as I was, not as you needed me to be.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>The blood drained from my face. *Sister by choice if not by blood.* A pointed reminder of my adopted status.<br/><br/>&quot;&#x27;I harbor no illusions that my modest fortune could have enhanced the lives of my already privileged family, but I believe it can transform the futures of dozens of young women who start with nothing. In this way, perhaps my departure might create meaning beyond grief.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>Martin folded the letter. &quot;It&#x27;s signed, &#x27;With complicated love, Camille.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>The silence felt charged with my unspoken rage. Thirty million dollars. Gone. To strangers. To foster girls who would never appreciate it properly.<br/><br/>&quot;This can&#x27;t be legal,&quot; I finally said. &quot;She clearly wasn&#x27;t in her right mind.&quot;<br/><br/>Martin raised an eyebrow. &quot;The will was properly executed with witnesses who attested to her mental competence. The charitable intent is quite clear and legally sound.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But we&#x27;re her family,&quot; I insisted, looking to my parents for support. &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that count for anything?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille had every legal right to dispose of her property as she wished,&quot; Martin replied.<br/><br/>&quot;We could contest it,&quot; I suggested, turning to Dad. &quot;Argue undue influence or something.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad finally spoke, his voice tired. &quot;Rose, enough. Camille made her choice. We will respect it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But Dad...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I said enough. My daughter is dead. I won&#x27;t dishonor her memory by fighting over money none of us need.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom reached for his hand. &quot;Richard is right. This is what Camille wanted. Perhaps it will help us find meaning in her loss.&quot;<br/><br/>I stared at them in disbelief. Were they seriously accepting this?<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan?&quot; I turned to him, seeking an ally. &quot;Don&#x27;t you have anything to say?&quot;<br/><br/>He looked up slowly. &quot;What is there to say? Camille made her wishes clear.&quot; He gave a bitter laugh. &quot;At least I get the ring back. Small comfort.&quot;<br/><br/>Martin cleared his throat. &quot;The transfer process has already begun. The Lighthouse Foundation has been notified, though the public announcement will wait until the family has had time to process this privately.&quot;<br/><br/>As we prepared to leave, I noticed Dr. Elena Reyes, director of the Lighthouse Foundation, waiting in the reception area.<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t intrude on your family&#x27;s grief,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I only wanted to express how Camille&#x27;s generosity will change lives. The girls in our program face nearly impossible odds, and this gift will provide opportunities they could never have imagined.&quot;<br/><br/>Mom stepped forward, taking the woman&#x27;s hands in hers. &quot;Would you tell me about your program sometime? I&#x27;d like to know more about what Camille was supporting.&quot;<br/><br/>In the elevator, I maintained my composure with effort. &quot;I still think we should consider contesting the will. For Camille&#x27;s sake. She clearly wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad&#x27;s expression hardened. &quot;Drop it, Rose. The money and property were never yours to begin with. Camille made her choice, and we will honor it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But—&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I said drop it. I&#x27;ve lost my daughter. I won&#x27;t lose my integrity too by fighting over her wishes.&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator doors opened, ending the conversation.<br/><br/>I declined the offer to ride home with my parents. In my own car, with the privacy screen raised, I finally let my mask slip, slamming my fist against the leather seat.<br/><br/>Thirty million dollars and the Cedar Hill estate. The amounts kept repeating in my mind like a taunt. Assets Camille had hidden from me. Wealth that should have been mine. Money now flowing to unwashed, uncultured foster brats who would never deserve it the way I did.<br/><br/>I, who had survived the system through cunning and determination. I, who had clawed my way into the Lewis family through careful study and perfect performance. I, who had spent fourteen years proving my superiority over their biological daughter.<br/><br/>And now, the final insult, Camille&#x27;s money going to help girls from the very background I&#x27;d fought so desperately to escape and conceal.<br/><br/>The journals sat beside me, a mocking reminder of her final message. *In hope rather than malice*. As if she&#x27;d somehow known I would take them. As if she&#x27;d anticipated my every move.<br/><br/>But she couldn&#x27;t have. The real Camille had been naive, trusting, easily manipulated. This will had likely been written in a moment of misguided altruism, not calculated revenge.<br/><br/>Unless...<br/><br/>What if Camille had updated her will after discovering I and Stefan&#x27;s affair before her death? After beginning to see through my manipulations?<br/><br/>What if the money had originally been intended for me, and she&#x27;d changed her mind upon discovering my betrayal?<br/><div class="pagination"><a href="28.html">« Prev</a><a href="30.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
