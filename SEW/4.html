My third? Fourth? I&#x27;d lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.<br/><br/>Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille&#x27;s genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.<br/><br/>Rose.<br/><br/>Even her name felt like betrayal now.<br/><br/>My phone lit up with another message from her: &quot;Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.&quot;<br/><br/>Celebrate. Like we hadn&#x27;t just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who&#x27;d given me three years of devotion I never deserved.<br/><br/>The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan?&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice was small, uncertain. &quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br/><br/>I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.<br/><br/>&quot;I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?&quot; Her eyes were hopeful. &quot;Rose gave me the recipe...&quot;<br/><br/>Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m busy.&quot; I didn&#x27;t even look at the plate. &quot;Just leave it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Oh.&quot; A pause. &quot;It&#x27;s just, you&#x27;ve been working late all week, and I thought...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille.&quot; My voice sharp with an anger that wasn&#x27;t really meant for her. &quot;I said I&#x27;m busy.&quot;<br/><br/>She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I&#x27;d built on lies.<br/><br/>God, I&#x27;d been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I&#x27;d chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.<br/><br/>&quot;Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn&#x27;t suited for our family...&quot;<br/><br/>I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I&#x27;d tried to forget.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s trying so hard, Stefan.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. &quot;Maybe if you gave her more guidance...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like you did?&quot; I couldn&#x27;t keep the bitterness from my voice. &quot;Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. &quot;Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?&quot;<br/><br/>The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she&#x27;d claimed.<br/><br/>&quot;Why did you really leave?&quot; The question slipped out, colored by whiskey and old pain.<br/><br/>&quot;You know why.&quot; She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. &quot;Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...&quot;<br/><br/>Had we? I couldn&#x27;t remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I&#x27;d forgotten my lines.<br/><br/>&quot;She loves you,&quot; Rose whispered, too close now. &quot;More than I ever could.&quot;<br/><br/>But her eyes said something different. They always had.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&quot;I made your favorite breakfast.&quot; Camille&#x27;s smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. &quot;Happy anniversary.&quot;<br/><br/>The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose&#x27;s perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night &quot;meeting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t.&quot; I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. &quot;Early meeting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Oh.&quot; Her voice cracked slightly. &quot;Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t wait up.&quot;<br/><br/>I&#x27;d spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She&#x27;d worn the same perfume she&#x27;d worn in Rome, all those years ago.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s kinder this way,&quot; she&#x27;d said, stroking my hair. &quot;A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.&quot;<br/><br/>Would she? The look in her eyes when she&#x27;d seen Rose&#x27;s photo...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.<br/><br/>&quot;Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not now, Mother.&quot;<br/><br/>She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. &quot;Rose is worried about you. We all are.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Worried?&quot; I laughed, harsh and broken. &quot;Like you were worried about Camille all these years?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That girl was never right for you.&quot; Mother&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;Rose, on the other hand...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stop.&quot; I stood, unsteady. &quot;Just... stop.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Did you?&quot; The words exploded out of me. &quot;You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?&quot;<br/><br/>Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I&#x27;d never raised my voice to her.<br/><br/>&quot;Everything she did was wrong, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot; I continued, the scotch making me brave. &quot;Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because she understands our world! She...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She understands manipulation.&quot; The truth hit me like a freight train. &quot;She played us all. You, me, Camille...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous.&quot; Mother straightened her designer jacket. &quot;Rose loves you. She always has.&quot;<br/><br/>Had she? Or had she loved the game more?<br/><br/>I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she&#x27;d orchestrated our &quot;chance&quot; meetings after returning from London. The way she&#x27;d encouraged Camille&#x27;s insecurities while playing the supportive sister.<br/><br/>Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently &quot;sick,&quot; Rose in that dress I&#x27;d loved in Rome...<br/><br/>&quot;Mother.&quot; I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. &quot;Please leave.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go. Tell Rose... tell her...&quot; What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I&#x27;d destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she&#x27;d carefully crafted?<br/><br/>Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose&#x27;s perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I&#x27;d chosen.<br/><br/>My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: &quot;Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.&quot;<br/><br/>Home.<br/><br/>I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille&#x27;s wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.<br/><br/>What had I done?<br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><div class="pagination"><a href="3.html">« Prev</a><a href="5.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
