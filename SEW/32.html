Promising neural interface technology. Currently entertaining acquisition offers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And?&quot; I asked, waiting for the catch. With Victoria, there was always a catch.<br/><br/>&quot;And you&#x27;ll be handling the acquisition.&quot; She leaned back, expression unreadable. &quot;Alone.&quot;<br/><br/>My heart stuttered. After eight months of shadowing Victoria at Kane Industries, this was my first real test.<br/><br/>&quot;Their valuation?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re asking ninety million. They&#x27;re worth sixty-five, at most. I want them for fifty.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When do negotiations begin?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Two hours. The meeting is set for eleven at our downtown offices.&quot;<br/><br/>My head snapped up. &quot;Today? You&#x27;re giving me two hours to prepare?&quot;<br/><br/>A small, cold smile played at her mouth. &quot;In business, opportunities rarely announce themselves weeks in advance. Besides, you&#x27;ve had eight months of preparation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Who am I negotiating against?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Marcus Whitfield.&quot;<br/><br/>The name hit me like a physical blow. Whitfield, legendary venture capitalist, notorious for destroying less experienced negotiators.<br/><br/>In my suite, I changed into a power suit, charcoal gray pinstripe, crisp white blouse, three-inch heels. The woman in the mirror looked confident, capable, born to command respect.<br/><br/>A perfect illusion.<br/><br/>The executive conference room was already set up when I arrived. Through the glass walls, I saw the Neurix team and Whitfield—tall, broad-shouldered, emanating authority.<br/><br/>The introductions blurred past. Dr. Morris, Neurix CEO. His team. And Whitfield, whose handshake came with assessing eyes that told me everything. He was surprised to see me, not Victoria. An easier target.<br/><br/>For thirty minutes, I led a technical discussion about their patents and milestones, highlighting weaknesses. Morris and his team grew increasingly uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Then Whitfield struck.<br/><br/>&quot;Axiom is offering eighty-five million,&quot; Morris blurted. &quot;With twenty percent contingent on Phase II results.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re prepared to offer sixty-five million, all cash, no contingencies,&quot; I countered.<br/><br/>Whitfield&#x27;s smile was thin. &quot;Sixty-five versus eighty-five? No contest. And frankly, I&#x27;m surprised Victoria sent you with such an unprepared position.&quot;<br/><br/>The mention of Victoria stung exactly as he&#x27;d intended. He was playing me now, not just the Neurix team.<br/><br/>The situation spiraled. Victoria&#x27;s target price seemed impossible. Even seventy million looked unrealistic.<br/><br/>&quot;Wait,&quot; I said desperately. &quot;Kane can offer seventy-five million. All cash. No contingencies.&quot;<br/><br/>The words hung in the air. I had no authority to make that offer.<br/><br/>&quot;Eighty,&quot; I added, going all in. &quot;Eighty million, final offer.&quot;<br/><br/>But it was too late. Morris signed with Axiom. Right there in Kane Industries&#x27; own conference room.<br/><br/>&quot;Send Victoria my regards,&quot; Whitfield said quietly as he left. &quot;And a word of advice—next time, she might want to handle important negotiations herself.&quot;<br/><br/>Four hours later, I stood in Victoria&#x27;s office, waiting for judgment.<br/><br/>&quot;Explain,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>&quot;I failed,&quot; I said simply. &quot;Whitfield outmaneuvered me at every turn.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You offered eighty million for a company I valued at fifty.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I panicked. Because I wasn&#x27;t prepared to walk away with nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All true,&quot; she agreed. &quot;And all inexcusable.&quot;<br/><br/>The word cut deeper than any physical pain from my combat training.<br/><br/>&quot;I set you up to fail,&quot; Victoria continued, her tone unchanged. &quot;Deliberately.&quot;<br/><br/>I blinked. &quot;What?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I chose Neurix specifically because I knew Whitfield was representing Axiom&#x27;s bid. I gave you impossible parameters. I wanted to see how you would handle absolute failure.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This was a test?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Everything is a test, Camille. I thought you understood that by now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then why?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because in real battle, you don&#x27;t get to choose your conditions. Rose won&#x27;t fight fair when the time comes. She&#x27;ll use every advantage, every dirty trick. I needed to see how you perform when everything is against you.&quot;<br/><br/>The logic was brutally sound, but the humiliation remained, burning in my chest.<br/><br/>&quot;And how did I perform?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Poorly,&quot; she said without hesitation. &quot;You lost composure. You made emotional decisions. You allowed Whitfield to manipulate your fear of disappointing me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But,&quot; Victoria continued, &quot;you didn&#x27;t break. You didn&#x27;t run. You came back to face the consequences. That&#x27;s something.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the window. &quot;When I first started building Kane Industries, I lost a major contract negotiation. My first real opportunity, squandered through inexperience.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What did you do?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I identified every mistake. Studied them. Ensured I would never repeat them.&quot; She turned back. &quot;Then I went after the next opportunity with twice the preparation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And did you succeed?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No. I failed again. But differently. New mistakes. More sophisticated errors. Until eventually, success became the expectation, not the exception.&quot; Her gaze was measuring. &quot;That&#x27;s what separates winners from losers, Camille. Not whether they fail, but what they do with that failure.&quot;<br/><br/>Something shifted inside me. The humiliation was still there, but beside it grew something harder. A cold certainty that I would never allow myself to be outmaneuvered like that again.<br/><br/>&quot;What happens now?&quot; I asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Now you document every mistake. Study them. Learn from them. And prepare for your next test.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not yet determined. But rest assured, it will come when you least expect it. When you&#x27;re most vulnerable. Just like today.&quot;<br/><br/>Just like life. Just like revenge.<br/><br/>As I walked toward Dr. Reed&#x27;s office later, something crystallized inside me. Victoria had engineered today&#x27;s failure as a forging fire, heating the metal of my character to shape it into something stronger, sharper.<br/><br/>Rose had spent years undermining me, ensuring I remained weak and pliable. Today&#x27;s humiliation was just one more step in becoming someone she would never recognize. Someone she could never again manipulate or defeat.<br/><br/>Next time, I wouldn&#x27;t be the one walking away empty-handed. Next time, I would be the predator, not the prey.<br/><br/>And there would be no mercy.<br/><br/>**** *****<div class="pagination"><a href="31.html">« Prev</a><a href="33.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
