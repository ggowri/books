I adjusted my black dress and studied the others in the conference room. Mom dabbed at her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. Dad stared blankly at the polished table. Stefan sat apart from us, face drawn and pale.<br/><br/>All of us performing our assigned roles. The grieving family. The heartbroken ex-husband. A perfect tableau of loss.<br/><br/>And why wouldn&#x27;t we? Camille was dead. I knew that for certain. The men I&#x27;d hired hadn&#x27;t just scared her as originally planned, they&#x27;d gone further, forcing her car off that bridge, watching it sink into the dark water. They&#x27;d called me afterward, panic in their voices. I&#x27;d paid them extra for their silence, then cut all contact.<br/><br/>Martin Greene entered, carrying a leather portfolio. Dad&#x27;s longtime lawyer looked appropriately grave as he took a seat.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; he said. &quot;With the court having legally declared Camille deceased in absentia, we can now proceed with her last will and testament.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is this really necessary?&quot; Mom asked, voice wavering. &quot;It&#x27;s only been six months.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In cases of drowning where no body is recovered, the court can grant a death certificate after reasonable search efforts have concluded,&quot; Martin explained. &quot;As Camille had significant independent assets that require disposition, the judge approved the declaration last week.&quot;<br/><br/>I kept my expression neutral, though my mind raced. Independent assets? What independent assets?<br/><br/>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t aware my sister had estate planning,&quot; I said, injecting just the right note of confusion.<br/><br/>Martin opened his portfolio. &quot;Camille updated her will last year, shortly after her twenty-fifth birthday. As you may recall, that was when she received her inheritance from her grandfather.&quot;<br/><br/>My blood froze. Grandfather Lewis. Dad&#x27;s father. The crusty old man who had doted on Camille, his only biological grandchild, while largely ignoring me.<br/><br/>&quot;What inheritance?&quot; I asked sharply, then immediately softened my tone. &quot;I mean, she never mentioned receiving anything substantial.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad finally looked up. &quot;My father left Camille a portion of his estate when she turned twenty-five. It was private, between them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How large a portion?&quot; The question escaped before I could temper it.<br/><br/>Martin cleared his throat. &quot;Mr. Lewis Senior established a trust for Camille valued at approximately thirty million dollars, along with the Cedar Hill estate.&quot;<br/><br/>The room spun around me. Thirty million dollars. Plus a mansion on twenty acres of prime land. And she had never said a word.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s impossible,&quot; I whispered. &quot;I would have known.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille wanted it kept quiet,&quot; Dad said. &quot;She said money changes how people see you.&quot;<br/><br/>Martin removed a document from his portfolio. &quot;This is the last will and testament of Camille Elizabeth Lewis, revised and signed six months before her passing.&quot;<br/><br/>I leaned forward. Whatever secret fortune she&#x27;d hidden, it would surely come to her family now. To me, her only sister.<br/><br/>&quot;To my parents, Richard and Margaret Lewis, I leave my collection of family photographs and my gratitude for the life they gave me.&quot;<br/><br/>Martin paused, glancing at my parents. Dad nodded stiffly. Mom&#x27;s crying grew louder.<br/><br/>&quot;To my sister, Rose Lewis, I leave my journal collection, in hopes she may come to understand me better in death than she did in life.&quot;<br/><br/>The journals. The ones I&#x27;d already taken and altered. A chill ran down my spine.<br/><br/>&quot;To my former husband, Stefan Rodriguez, I return the engagement ring that belonged to his grandmother, with the hope that next time he gives it, it will be with honesty and true devotion.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan flinched visibly. The ring had been a source of pride, a family heirloom that supposedly symbolized his commitment.<br/><br/>&quot;As to the remainder of my estate, including all financial assets, investment accounts, personal property not specifically mentioned, the Cedar Hill estate, and the entire balance of the trust established by my grandfather, I direct that it be liquidated and the proceeds distributed as follows.&quot;<br/><br/>Here it was. The thirty million dollars and luxury estate that would surely be distributed among us.<br/><br/>&quot;One hundred percent of said assets shall be donated to the Lighthouse Foundation for Abused and Abandoned Children, to establish the Camille Lewis Memorial Fund for the education and support of girls in the foster system.&quot;<br/><br/>The silence that followed was absolute. Even Mom&#x27;s crying stopped abruptly.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; I said, my voice unnaturally high, &quot;but could you repeat that?&quot;<br/><br/>Martin glanced up. &quot;The entirety of Camille&#x27;s estate, after specific bequests, is to be donated to the Lighthouse Foundation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not possible.&quot; The words burst from me. &quot;There must be some mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s no mistake, Ms. Lewis. The will is quite clear and legally binding.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But...&quot; I struggled to maintain composure. &quot;That&#x27;s thirty million dollars and a prime piece of real estate. Going to complete strangers. While her family gets nothing but photographs and... and journals?&quot;<br/><br/>Martin withdrew an envelope. &quot;She also left a letter to be read at this time, explaining her decisions.&quot;<br/><br/>Dad nodded his permission, his expression unreadable.<br/><br/>Martin broke the seal on the envelope and unfolded the letter within.<br/><br/>---<div class="pagination"><a href="27.html">« Prev</a><a href="29.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
