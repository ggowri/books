To the certainty in his voice when he&#x27;d all but named me as Camille Lewis. To the strange connection I&#x27;d felt despite the threat he represented.<br/><br/>&quot;The press coverage is universally positive,&quot; Victoria noted over coffee, scanning reports on her tablet. &quot;Your debut is being hailed as the social event of the season. Several publications are already speculating about the impact you&#x27;ll have on Kane Industries moving forward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Pierce?&quot; I asked, unable to keep the question contained any longer. &quot;Any mention of our interaction?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes flicked up to mine, assessing. &quot;Nothing specific. Though the business press notes his unexpected appearance at an event hosted by his chief competitor.&quot;<br/><br/>She set down her tablet, giving me her full attention, a rare occurrence during morning briefings. &quot;You seem... preoccupied with Alexander Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>Not a question. An observation that demanded explanation.<br/><br/>&quot;He threatened everything we&#x27;ve built,&quot; I pointed out, keeping my voice neutral. &quot;Identified me despite all our precautions. That seems worthy of preoccupation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria agreed, studying me with the penetrating gaze that always made me feel transparent. &quot;But there&#x27;s something more. Something you&#x27;re not sharing.&quot;<br/><br/>I hesitated, unsure how to articulate the strange pull I&#x27;d felt toward Pierce without sounding foolish. Without sounding like the old Camille, easily swayed by attention from confident men.<br/><br/>&quot;There was something... familiar about him,&quot; I said finally. &quot;Not that I&#x27;ve met him before. But a sense that he understood something about me that others don&#x27;t. Can&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained unreadable, but I sensed a shift in her attention, a sharpening of focus. &quot;Elaborate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He looked at me and saw through the surface,&quot; I tried to explain. &quot;Not just suspecting I might be Camille Lewis, but... seeing me. The person beneath the transformation.&quot;<br/><br/>My words sounded ridiculous to my own ears, mystical rather than strategic, emotional rather than calculated. Everything Victoria had trained me to avoid.<br/><br/>Yet she didn&#x27;t dismiss my observation. Instead, she seemed to consider it carefully, fingers tapping a slow rhythm on the polished table.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander Pierce has always possessed unusual insight into people,&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;It&#x27;s part of what makes him dangerous. He sees patterns others miss, connections others overlook.&quot;<br/><br/>She rose, moving to the window that overlooked the front drive where her car waited. &quot;Whatever connection you feel, whatever recognition you sensed, remember that it serves his purposes, not yours. Not ours.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; I agreed quickly, embarrassed to have revealed even that much vulnerability. &quot;I&#x27;m not suggesting otherwise.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria turned back to me, her expression softening fractionally. &quot;Pierce is brilliant, charismatic, and utterly ruthless in pursuit of his goals. Much like me, in that regard.&quot; A small, tight smile. &quot;Perhaps that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve been such effective rivals.&quot;<br/><br/>She gathered her things, preparing to depart for the office. &quot;The security team will have a complete dossier on his recent activities by this afternoon. Until then, proceed with today&#x27;s schedule as planned. The TechVault integration meetings require your full attention.&quot;<br/><br/>With that, she was gone, leaving me with a strange sense of having revealed too much and learned too little all at once.<br/><br/>The morning passed in a blur of meetings and conference calls, the business of Kane Industries demanding complete focus. Yet beneath the professional exterior I maintained, thoughts of Alexander Pierce continued to surface at unexpected moments.<br/><br/>The way he&#x27;d looked at me. The certainty in his voice. The promise of seeing each other again.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering what he was doing now. Whether he was thinking about our encounter as well. Whether he was already planning our next meeting, or if his attention had moved on to other matters, other adversaries.<br/><br/>The latter possibility bothered me more than it should have.<br/><br/>By late afternoon, fatigue from the previous night&#x27;s broken sleep finally caught up with me. I retreated to my office, instructing my assistant to hold calls for thirty minutes while I reviewed documents that required privacy. Once alone, I moved to the window seat, allowing myself a rare moment of unguarded thought.<br/><br/>Alexander Pierce had recognized me. Had seen through layers of surgical alteration, physical transformation, and behavioral retraining to the woman I&#x27;d been before. The question that haunted me wasn&#x27;t how he&#x27;d done it, but why it mattered so much to me that he had.<br/><br/>Was it simple fear of exposure? Of having everything Victoria and I had built together threatened by one man&#x27;s dangerous knowledge?<br/><br/>Or was it the vertigo-inducing sensation of being truly seen after a year of perfect disguise? The strange relief mixed with terror when someone looked past Camille Kane to the woman beneath, the woman I sometimes feared I&#x27;d lost completely in the transformation.<br/><br/>I closed my eyes, the afternoon sun warm on my face through the window glass. Whatever the reason, Alexander Pierce had disturbed something in me that had been carefully buried, carefully controlled. Something that would need to be addressed if I was to maintain the clarity of purpose Victoria had instilled in me<br/><br/>When we meet again, I would be ready. Would have answers to the questions he raised, both spoken and unspoken. Would understand the threat he presented and how to neutralize it.<br/><br/>Would understand why, despite everything, I found myself almost looking forward to our next encounter.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><div class="pagination"><a href="39.html">« Prev</a><a href="41.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
