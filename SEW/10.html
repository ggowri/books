I stared out the window, watching trees blur into gray mist. Victoria sat beside me, her face a mask of calm, but her fingers tapped a nervous rhythm on her leather bag.<br/><br/>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; I asked, breaking the silence that had stretched between us since we left the mansion thirty minutes ago. The papers making me officially Camille Kane had been signed at dawn, the ink barely dry.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes stayed fixed on the passing landscape. &quot;To meet someone important.&quot;<br/><br/>The car turned onto a narrow road lined with tall iron gates and stone walls. A cemetery. My stomach tightened.<br/><br/>&quot;Sophia?&quot; I whispered.<br/><br/>Victoria nodded once, sharp and quick, like admitting pain. &quot;Today marks ten years since I lost her.&quot;<br/><br/>The cemetery was empty of visitors, kept private by security guards who nodded respectfully as our car passed. Ancient trees created a natural cathedral over graves that dated back centuries. This was no ordinary resting place, but one reserved for families with names that appeared in history books.<br/><br/>Our driver stopped at the end of a curving path. &quot;We walk from here,&quot; Victoria said, gathering her bag and stepping out without waiting for help.<br/><br/>I followed her along a stone path that wound uphill toward a secluded corner overlooking the city. The grass here was greener, the flowers fresher. Clearly tended with special care.<br/><br/>We stopped before a white marble headstone, simple yet elegant. Quality that whispered rather than shouted.<br/><br/>SOPHIA ELIZABETH KANE<br/>BELOVED DAUGHTER<br/>TAKEN TOO SOON<br/>1990-2013<br/><br/>Below those words, a single line of poetry: &quot;Some souls are too bright for this world.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria placed white lilies by the stone, her movements practiced yet tender. I hung back, feeling like an intruder on this private grief.<br/><br/>&quot;Come,&quot; she said, not looking at me. &quot;She would want to meet you.&quot;<br/><br/>I stepped forward, uneasy. What do you say to a grave of someone you never knew? Someone whose death made your new life possible?<br/><br/>Victoria knelt despite her expensive suit, uncaring about grass stains or dirt. &quot;Hello, my darling,&quot; she said, touching the carved letters of Sophia&#x27;s name. &quot;I&#x27;ve brought someone to meet you.&quot;<br/><br/>The wind picked up, sending fallen leaves dancing around us. I zipped my jacket higher, shivering from more than just cold.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me about her,&quot; I said. &quot;The real story, not the public version.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria was quiet so long I thought she wouldn&#x27;t answer. When she spoke, her voice had lost its usual sharp edge.<br/><br/>&quot;Sophia was brilliant. Graduated MIT at twenty. Could solve equations that baffled men twice her age. But she was also kind, which I failed to teach her.&quot; A bitter smile crossed her lips. &quot;That she learned despite me.&quot;<br/><br/>I waited as Victoria gathered her thoughts, watching her fingers trace her daughter&#x27;s name over and over.<br/><br/>&quot;She fell in love with Oliver Preston. Old money, old connections. Handsome, charming, seemed perfect. His family owned shipping companies that competed with our tech enterprises.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;They never thought her good enough. The Kanes were new money, self-made. I came from nothing. Built everything. They came from generations of wealth, of &#x27;proper breeding.&#x27; They thought Sophia beneath them.&quot;<br/><br/>The familiar sting of rejection echoed in my chest. Always being measured and found wanting.<br/><br/>&quot;What happened?&quot; I asked, though part of me already knew.<br/><br/>&quot;They were engaged six months when she died. Car crash on a mountain road. Brake lines cut.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice turned to ice. &quot;Police called it an accident. I knew better.&quot;<br/><br/>She stood, brushing dirt from her knees. &quot;The Prestons celebrated quietly. Their son free to marry someone from the &#x27;right&#x27; background. They underestimated how far a mother would go for justice.&quot;<br/><br/>The look in her eyes made me shiver again. This wasn&#x27;t grief anymore, but something harder. Colder.<br/><br/>&quot;One by one, their companies failed. Stock prices crashed. Ships lost at sea. Mysterious audits. Computer systems failing. Nothing that could be traced back to me, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile was terrible to behold. &quot;Oliver married the girl they chose. Three months later, he jumped from his penthouse. Left a note confessing he&#x27;d known about the brake lines. Couldn&#x27;t live with the guilt.&quot;<br/><br/>I swallowed hard. &quot;And the rest of the family?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Bankrupt within two years. Their homes sold. Their treasures auctioned. The Preston name forgotten by society that once bowed to them.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria looked at me fully now. &quot;That&#x27;s the lesson, Camille. Revenge isn&#x27;t about violence or threats. It&#x27;s about patience. About being smarter. About taking what matters most to those who hurt you.&quot;<br/><br/>She opened her bag, removing a small wooden chest. Beautifully carved, with silver hinges and lock. About the size of a jewelry box.<br/><br/>&quot;This brings us to why we&#x27;re here today.&quot;<br/><br/>She held out the box to me. I took it, feeling its surprising weight.<br/><br/>&quot;What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your funeral.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s eyes were steady on mine. &quot;For Camille Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>Understanding dawned slowly. &quot;You want me to...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Put everything inside. Every memory, attachment, and weakness of your old life. Everything that was Camille Lewis must go in that box.&quot;<br/><br/>I stared at the chest in my hands, suddenly unsteady on my feet.<br/><br/>&quot;You can&#x27;t become who you need to be while clinging to who you were,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;The woman they hurt, they used, they discarded, she must die here today.&quot;<br/><br/>My fingers traced the carved wood. &quot;And if I&#x27;m not ready?&quot;<div class="pagination"><a href="9.html">« Prev</a><a href="11.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
