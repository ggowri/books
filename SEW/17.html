I tried to block like Jason had taught me, but my arms felt heavy as stone. His knuckles grazed my cheek as I stumbled backward.<br/><br/>&quot;Too slow,&quot; he barked. &quot;Again.&quot;<br/><br/>My lungs burned. Sweat stung my eyes. We&#x27;d been at this for almost two hours, and the digital clock on the gym wall showed 5:47 AM. The sun wasn&#x27;t even up yet.<br/><br/>Jason Winters stood opposite me on the training mat, barely breathing hard. His military haircut and scarred face gave nothing away, no tiredness, no frustration, just cold assessment. As Victoria&#x27;s head of security, he&#x27;d protected presidents and royalty before becoming my combat instructor three weeks ago.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t,&quot; I gasped, hands on my knees. &quot;Need water.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your sister won&#x27;t give you water when she&#x27;s destroying everything you love,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;Your ex-husband won&#x27;t offer a break when he&#x27;s laughing at your weakness.&quot;<br/><br/>The mention of Rose and Stefan sent fresh anger coursing through me. I straightened, raising my fists again.<br/><br/>Jason nodded once, approval flickering in his gray eyes. &quot;Channel it. Use it.&quot;<br/><br/>He circled me slowly. I tracked his movement, watching for tells we&#x27;d discussed yesterday, the slight shoulder drop before he jabbed, the weight shift before he kicked.<br/><br/>There, his right foot pivoted slightly. I ducked the punch that followed, slipping inside his guard like he&#x27;d demonstrated. My counter-strike hit his ribs, not hard enough to damage but enough to make him grunt.<br/><br/>&quot;Better,&quot; he said, stepping back. &quot;You&#x27;re learning.&quot;<br/><br/>Those words were the closest thing to praise I&#x27;d received since this nightmare training began. Three weeks of waking at 4:30 AM for combat lessons with Jason, followed by business classes, language instruction, etiquette training, and endless other lessons designed to transform me from Camille Lewis into Camille Kane.<br/><br/>&quot;Ten minute break,&quot; Jason said, checking his watch. &quot;Then weapons training.&quot;<br/><br/>I collapsed onto a bench, grabbing my water bottle with shaking hands. My body felt like one massive bruise. Even my fingernails hurt.<br/><br/>In the mirrored wall opposite me, a stranger stared back. My once-long brown hair had been cut into a sleek bob and dyed a rich, darker shade. My face had thinned from the grueling exercise regiment and surgery, cheekbones now sharp enough to cut glass. Designer workout clothes clung to a body that had grown leaner, harder.<br/><br/>I barely recognized myself anymore. Which was exactly the point.<br/><br/>&quot;Water won&#x27;t restore your electrolytes,&quot; a crisp voice said from the doorway. Victoria stood there in her impeccable business suit, looking as though she&#x27;d been awake for hours. Perhaps she had.<br/><br/>She crossed to me, handing over a green smoothie in a steel tumbler. &quot;Protein, vitamins, minerals. Drink it all.&quot;<br/><br/>The taste was awful—like liquified grass with a hint of metal—but I&#x27;d learned not to complain. Victoria didn&#x27;t tolerate weakness, especially not from her &quot;daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Jason reports improvement,&quot; she said, scrolling through messages on her phone. &quot;Though your defensive reactions remain inadequate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve never fought before,&quot; I muttered, gulping the vile smoothie. &quot;Three weeks ago, my biggest physical challenge was yoga twice a month.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes flicked up from her screen. &quot;And how did that serve you when Rose took everything? When Stefan discarded you? When those men attacked you in the parking garage?&quot;<br/><br/>The memory of fists connecting with my ribs sent phantom pain through my body. I flinched.<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Victoria said, noting my reaction. &quot;The world doesn&#x27;t care about fair. It respects only strength and the willingness to use it.&quot;<br/><br/>She checked her watch, a discreet Patek Philippe that probably cost more than my parents&#x27; car. &quot;Your meeting with Japanese investors is at nine. After that, corporate finance with Professor Whitman until noon. Lunch with the editor of Vanity Fair, she&#x27;s profiling young female entrepreneurs and wants to include Camille Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>My stomach dropped. &quot;A journalist? Already? But we&#x27;ve barely established my background. What if....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The groundwork is laid,&quot; Victoria cut me off. &quot;Your Stanford and Harvard credentials have been verified by three separate media outlets. Your childhood in Swiss boarding schools explains your absence from American social circles. The timing is perfect, mysterious heiress emerges just as public interest peaks.&quot;<br/><br/>Jason returned, carrying a collection of wooden training knives. Victoria nodded to him and turned back to me.<div class="pagination"><a href="16.html">« Prev</a><a href="18.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
