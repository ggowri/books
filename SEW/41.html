The statement carried the weight of command rather than request.<br/><br/>Camille paused by the doorway of Victoria&#x27;s home office. &quot;The Bellamy auction? Isn&#x27;t that where...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria confirmed, finally glancing up with calculating eyes. &quot;According to my sources, both Rose and Stefan will be in attendance. Rose has been desperately trying to secure a meeting with Kane Industries&#x27; investment team for weeks. This presents an... opportunity.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s heart quickened. &quot;To see them?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To observe their dynamics in a neutral setting. To understand exactly what you&#x27;re up against.&quot; Victoria rose from her chair, moving to stand before Camille with critical assessment. &quot;The question is whether you&#x27;re ready.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve spent months preparing,&quot; Camille replied, steadying her voice. &quot;I&#x27;ve changed everything about myself. They won&#x27;t recognize me.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained unconvinced. &quot;Physical transformation is only part of it. Can you maintain your composure when you see the man who abandoned you with the sister who betrayed you?&quot;<br/><br/>The question struck like a physical blow, but Camille didn&#x27;t flinch. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Even when anger threatens to overwhelm you? When every instinct screams to reveal yourself?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille repeated, more firmly this time.<br/><br/>Victoria studied her for a long moment before nodding once. &quot;The Dior in midnight blue. Simple diamond studs. Your hair swept back. You are Camille Kane tonight, confident, untouchable. Remember, you aren&#x27;t attending to confront them. You&#x27;re there to remind yourself why all of this is necessary. Remember who you are now. Camille Kane. My daughter. My heir.&quot; With those words lingering in her mind, Camille prepared for the evening ahead.<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>The evening at the gallery had drawn Manhattan&#x27;s elite like moths to flame, their jewelry catching light beneath crystal chandeliers. Through the glittering crowd, Camille saw them first, Rose and Stefan entering arm in arm, her sister&#x27;s red dress a slash of color against Stefan&#x27;s dark suit. The sight sent ice through her veins, though nothing showed on her carefully composed face.<br/><br/>She kept her champagne glass steady, maintained her pleasant expression as she discussed upcoming exhibitions with the museum curator. But beneath that polished exterior, her pulse quickened with a mix of rage and anticipation. They moved through the room like they owned it, Rose&#x27;s practiced laugh carrying over the general chatter, Stefan&#x27;s hand resting possessively at her waist.<br/><br/>When the curator excused himself, Camille knew what was coming. She watched Rose&#x27;s predatory gaze scan the room, noting faces, calculating connections. The moment her sister spotted her, those familiar eyes lit with interest, registering the designer dress, the subtle jewelry, the way other guests deferred to her presence.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve been properly introduced,&quot; Rose purred, extending her hand with practiced grace. &quot;Rose Lewis. And this is my fiancé, Stefan Rodriguez.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille accepted the hand that had once straightened her wedding veil, fought back the urge to either crush it or recoil. &quot;Camille Kane. A pleasure.&quot;<br/><br/>She watched confusion flicker across Stefan&#x27;s face at her name, quickly masked but present. Rose&#x27;s smile remained fixed, though calculation sparked behind her eyes as she processed the surname.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane... any relation to Victoria Kane?&quot; The casual tone couldn&#x27;t hide her sudden intensity.<br/><br/>&quot;My mother,&quot; Camille replied simply, watching that information land. Rose&#x27;s smile widened fractionally, here was the connection she&#x27;d been hoping to make since her failed meeting with Kane Industries.<br/><br/>&quot;How fascinating!&quot; Rose leaned in slightly, like sharing a confidence. &quot;I&#x27;ve long admired your mother&#x27;s business acumen. In fact, I recently had the pleasure of meeting with one of her representatives about potential investment in my fashion line.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille let her lips curve in the slight smile Victoria had taught her, one that offered nothing while suggesting everything. &quot;Yes, I believe I saw the proposal cross my desk.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan shifted his weight, something about her clearly needling at his subconscious. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but have we met before? Something seems familiar...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t believe so,&quot; Camille replied coolly, even as her heart thundered in her chest. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent most of my life in Europe. Only recently returned to New York.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; he said quickly, though doubt lingered in his expression. &quot;My mistake. You just reminded me of someone for a moment.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose shot him a quick, sharp look before turning back to Camille with renewed warmth. &quot;We simply must have lunch soon. I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the current fashion landscape. Perhaps next week?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid my schedule is quite full,&quot; Camille demurred, using the subtle dismissal Victoria had drilled into her. &quot;But do keep in touch with our investment team. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be in contact once decisions are made.&quot;<br/><br/>She watched Rose&#x27;s smile tighten almost imperceptibly. Her sister wasn&#x27;t used to being the one seeking favor rather than granting it. The role reversal clearly unsettled her, though she recovered quickly.<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; Rose said smoothly. &quot;We won&#x27;t keep you from your other guests. Stefan?&quot;<br/><br/>As they moved away, Camille maintained her composed expression while victory sang through her veins. They hadn&#x27;t recognized her. The woman they had methodically destroyed stood right before them, and they hadn&#x27;t known her.<br/><br/>She excused herself to the powder room, needing a moment to steady her racing heart. The private space offered brief sanctuary, allowing her to study her reflection, the sharp cheekbones that had replaced softer features, the elegantly styled hair so different from her former length, the confidence in her posture that Dr. Torres&#x27;s work and Victoria&#x27;s training had carefully crafted. No trace remained of the woman they had known.<br/><br/>But that woman&#x27;s emotions still raged beneath the surface, memories of betrayal sharp as knives. Seeing them together, so casually content, so unburdened by their cruelty... it took every ounce of control not to reveal herself, not to show them exactly who stood before them.<br/><br/>The door opened and Camille instantly checked her expression. Rose entered, pausing briefly when she saw who occupied the mirror.<div class="pagination"><a href="40.html">« Prev</a><a href="42.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
