They sat at a candlelit table, champagne glasses raised in a toast. Stefan wore the tie I&#x27;d given him last Christmas. Rose wore my engagement ring.<br/><br/>Their laughter reached me somehow, cutting through the glass barrier. They were laughing at me.<br/><br/>&quot;Did you see her face?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice echoed unnaturally loud. &quot;When she found the divorce papers? Like a stupid puppy being abandoned at the shelter.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan chuckled, pouring more champagne. &quot;And when she realized it was you? God, I almost felt sorry for her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Almost,&quot; Rose agreed, her smile shark-like. &quot;But not quite. She made it too easy, Stef. Always so desperate to be loved. So willing to believe the lies.&quot;<br/><br/>They clinked glasses again. The sound transformed into breaking glass, shattering windows, car metal crumpling...<br/><br/>The scene shifted. I was in my car, rain hammering the windshield, wipers fighting a losing battle against the downpour. My cheeks were wet – tears or rain, I couldn&#x27;t tell anymore.<br/><br/>Headlights appeared behind me, too bright, too fast. Gaining.<br/><br/>I gripped the steering wheel tighter, foot pressing the accelerator. The headlights grew closer, lighting up my rearview mirror until I was blind.<br/><br/>A bump. Metal against metal. My car swerved.<br/><br/>Then I was flying, the world spinning as my car broke through the bridge railing. That weightless moment of suspension before gravity remembered me.<br/><br/>The water rushed up.<br/><br/>I screamed, the sound ending in a gurgle as icy water filled my lungs. As I sank, I saw them standing on the bridge. Rose. Stefan. My parents. All watching impassively as I drowned.<br/><br/>Rose waved goodbye, her smile triumphant.<br/><br/>&quot;Should we call someone?&quot; my mother asked, not particularly concerned.<br/><br/>&quot;Why bother?&quot; my father replied. &quot;She was always such a disappointment.&quot;<br/><br/>The water closed over my head, and darkness pulled me down, down, down...<br/><br/>I woke gasping, sheets tangled around my legs like grasping hands. For terrifying seconds, I couldn&#x27;t remember where I was. The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, painted cherubs, golden trim, luxury I hadn&#x27;t earned.<br/><br/>Victoria. The adoption. My new life.<br/><br/>Reality settled back, but the terror remained, clinging to my skin like river mud. I pushed myself upright, ignoring the protest from my healing ribs. Sweat plastered my nightgown to my body, and my heart hammered against my chest like it was trying to escape.<br/><br/>The digital clock on the bedside table glowed 3:17 AM. Too early to be awake, too late to hope for peaceful sleep. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, needing to move, to prove to myself I wasn&#x27;t drowning.<br/><br/>The marble floor was cold against my bare feet as I padded to the bathroom, flipping on lights as I went. The woman in the mirror was a stranger – hollow eyes, skin pale as paper, hair wild from thrashing in my sleep.<br/><br/>I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the nightmare&#x27;s residue. But when I closed my eyes, I saw them again. Laughing. Toasting. Celebrating my destruction.<br/><br/>A sound escaped me, something between a laugh and a sob. The absurdity suddenly hit me – I was standing in a bathroom worth more than my old car, in a mansion owned by one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest women, who wanted to adopt me because I looked like her dead daughter.<br/><br/>The laugh bubbled up again, louder this time, edged with hysteria. I pressed my hand against my mouth, trying to hold it in, but it was too late. The dam had broken.<br/><br/>I slid down the bathroom wall until I hit the floor, laughter transforming to sobs that tore through my chest. Every breath hurt my bruised ribs, but I couldn&#x27;t stop. Years of swallowed tears demanded release.<br/><br/>I cried for the little girl who&#x27;d never been enough. For the college dreams crushed by Rose&#x27;s lies. For three years of marriage to a man who&#x27;d never truly seen me. For the weak, trusting fool I&#x27;d been, giving chances to people who only wanted to use them against me.<br/><br/>My hands curled into fists, nails digging half-moons into my palms. The physical pain was almost a relief, something solid to focus on instead of the gaping emptiness inside.<br/><br/>&quot;Enough.&quot;<br/><br/>The voice cut through my breakdown like a knife. Victoria stood in the doorway, silver hair loose around her shoulders, wrapped in a black silk robe. Her face gave nothing away, but her eyes were sharp, assessing.<br/><br/>Shame burned through me. She&#x27;d offered me strength, power, a chance at revenge, and here I was, dissolving on her bathroom floor at three in the morning. Proving everyone right about weak, emotional Camille.<br/><br/>I tried to stand, to salvage some dignity, but my legs wouldn&#x27;t cooperate. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; I managed, voice raw from crying. &quot;The nightmare...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me.&quot; Not a request. A command.<br/><br/>I hesitated, then described the dream in halting sentences. The restaurant. The bridge. The water. Their faces as they watched me drown.<br/><br/>Victoria listened without interruption, without pitying murmurs or comforting platitudes. When I finished, she simply nodded.<br/><br/>&quot;Get up.&quot;<br/><br/>I stared at her. &quot;What?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Get up,&quot; she repeated, extending one hand. &quot;This floor is no place for a Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Her words hit like a splash of cold water. This floor was no place for a Kane. And that&#x27;s who I was now, or who I was becoming. Not weak Camille Lewis, but Camille Kane. Heir. Survivor. Avenger.<br/><br/>I took her hand, letting her pull me to my feet. Her grip was surprisingly strong for a woman her age, fingers cool and dry against my tear-damp skin.<br/><br/>&quot;Follow me,&quot; she said, turning without checking if I would obey.<br/><br/>I followed her through darkened hallways, past priceless artwork and antiques that glowed dimly in the shadows. We descended a grand staircase, my bare feet silent on plush carpet, and entered a part of the mansion I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</p><p></p><div class="pagination"><a href="7.html">« Prev</a><a href="9.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
