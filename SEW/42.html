My line really is doing exceptional things with sustainable luxury fashion. Perhaps I could have my assistant send over our latest projections?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met her sister&#x27;s eyes in the mirror, the same eyes that had watched Stefan sign divorce papers on her anniversary, that had feigned sympathy while stealing her husband, that had likely celebrated news of her &quot;death.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Lewis,&quot; Camille said quietly, savoring the small flinch Rose couldn&#x27;t quite hide. &quot;In business, timing is everything. And I&#x27;m afraid your timing is... unfortunate.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s smile faltered slightly. &quot;I don&#x27;t understand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The market is shifting. Luxury fashion is a crowded space.&quot; Camille turned to face her directly, allowing just a hint of the truth to color her words. &quot;Sometimes no matter how hard we try, no matter how perfect our presentation, things simply don&#x27;t work out the way we hoped.&quot;<br/><br/>Something dark flickered in Rose&#x27;s eyes, a glimpse of the calculating predator beneath her polished smile. &quot;Everything works out exactly as it should,&quot; she said, her tone carrying an edge. &quot;Eventually.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Camille agreed smoothly. &quot;But not always in the way we expect.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved toward the door, pausing with her hand on the handle. &quot;Congratulations on your engagement, by the way. Second chances are so rare, aren&#x27;t they?&quot;<br/><br/>The confused unease on Rose&#x27;s face was almost worth the years of pain that had led to this moment. Camille slipped out of the powder room, her composed exit masking the trembling in her hands.<br/><br/>Her controlled departure ended abruptly as she collided with someone just outside the door. Strong hands steadied her before she could stumble, the touch sending an unwelcome shiver down her spine.<br/><br/>&quot;We meet again, Ms. Kane,&quot; Alexander Pierce&#x27;s voice held that same knowing tone that had haunted her since the charity ball. &quot;Though perhaps we should stop running into each other quite so literally.&quot;<br/><br/>His gray eyes studied her face with unsettling intensity, his hands lingering on her arms a moment longer than necessary. When he finally released her, that infamous smirk played at his lips.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Pierce,&quot; she managed, fighting to keep her voice steady. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t aware you frequented art galleries.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I go where my interests lead me,&quot; he replied, his gaze never leaving her face. The unspoken meaning behind his words hung heavy in the air between them.<br/><br/>Across the room, Rose had emerged from the powder room just in time to witness their interaction. She drifted toward an elderly woman known for her encyclopedic knowledge of New York society, carefully positioning herself within earshot.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s Victoria Kane&#x27;s daughter with Alexander Pierce,&quot; the woman was telling another guest, her voice carrying just enough to reach Rose&#x27;s ears. &quot;The heiress to Kane Industries. Quite the story, adopted years ago but kept out of the public eye until recently. Now she&#x27;s set to inherit one of the largest fortunes in the world.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s perfectly manicured nails dug into her palm as the information sank in. The woman she&#x27;d just practically begged for investment wasn&#x27;t merely Victoria&#x27;s daughter or a Kane Industries executive, she was Victoria Kane&#x27;s chosen heir. The realization of how badly she&#x27;d mishandled their interaction made her stomach churn.<br/><br/>Stefan appeared at her side, noticing her sudden tension. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Do you realize who that is?&quot; Rose hissed under her breath, watching as Pierce and Camille continued their intense conversation. &quot;Victoria Kane&#x27;s daughter. Not just some company representative,  the actual heir to Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Camille felt caught between two fires, Pierce&#x27;s dangerous knowledge of her true identity, and Rose&#x27;s newly informed observation of their interaction. She could practically see the calculations happening behind her sister&#x27;s eyes, likely already planning how to salvage the situation and gain access to the Kane fortune.<br/><br/>&quot;Having an interesting evening?&quot; Pierce asked softly, clearly enjoying her discomfort. &quot;Family reunions can be so... complicated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you think you know,&quot; Camille replied quietly, &quot;but you&#x27;re playing a dangerous game.&quot;<br/><br/>His smile widened fractionally. &quot;On the contrary, Ms. Kane, or should I say Ms. Lewis? I think I&#x27;m the only one here who truly understands the game being played.&quot;<br/><br/>Before she could respond, he stepped closer, his voice dropping to barely a whisper. &quot;The question is, do you understand what you&#x27;re really playing for?&quot;<br/><br/>He moved past her then, leaving Camille with the unsettling sensation that she was missing something vital. Something that went beyond her carefully planned revenge. Something that Pierce could see but she couldn&#x27;t, or wouldn&#x27;t, acknowledge.<br/><br/>Across the room, Rose was already typing furiously on her phone, likely instructing her assistant to compile everything available about Victoria Kane&#x27;s mysterious daughter. Her earlier dismissal clearly burned, but now calculation replaced humiliation in her expression. She had always excelled at turning setbacks into opportunities.<br/><div class="pagination"><a href="41.html">« Prev</a><a href="43.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
