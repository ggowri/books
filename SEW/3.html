Victory tasted sweet, just like I&#x27;d imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I&#x27;d spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.<br/><br/>What a joke.<br/><br/>&quot;To freedom,&quot; I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He&#x27;d been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I&#x27;d change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.<br/><br/>I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.<br/><br/>I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They&#x27;d brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.<br/><br/>Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Hi! I&#x27;m Camille. I&#x27;ve always wanted a sister!&quot;<br/><br/>She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home&#x27;s industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.<br/><br/>I wanted to vomit.<br/><br/>Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I&#x27;d spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.<br/><br/>And she didn&#x27;t even appreciate it properly.<br/><br/>I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn&#x27;t know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose has such lovely manners,&quot; Mrs. Lewis .... Mom .....  had said, smiling at me. &quot;Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>That&#x27;s when I saw it. The first crack in Camille&#x27;s perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.<br/><br/>It was beautiful.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan&#x27;s face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.<br/><br/>&quot;Darling, you&#x27;re being needy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose.&quot; His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? &quot;She&#x27;s gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t that what we wanted?&quot; I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I&#x27;d used all those times I&#x27;d counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I&#x27;d carefully orchestrated.<br/><br/>&quot;I just... the way she looked at me...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, sweetheart.&quot; I let steel edge into my sweetness. &quot;Are you having second thoughts? After everything we&#x27;ve been through?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No! No, of course not. I love you. I&#x27;ve always loved you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It&#x27;s pathetic.&quot;<br/><br/>I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who I&#x27;d spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.<br/><br/>But he&#x27;d served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.<br/><br/>The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.<br/><br/>God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.<br/><br/>A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister&#x27;s emotional state. Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.<br/><br/>Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille&#x27;s confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.<br/><br/>The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille&#x27;s &quot;secret&quot; diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I&#x27;d written myself, of course, in Camille&#x27;s childish handwriting that I&#x27;d spent months practicing to forge.<br/><br/>Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn&#x27;t ready for college. Needed time to &quot;find herself.&quot; Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.<br/><br/>Where I could watch her.<br/><br/>I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I&#x27;d really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.<br/><br/>No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: &quot;Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.&quot;<br/><br/>I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan&#x27;s pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille&#x27;s mental state.<br/><br/>By the time I was done, they&#x27;d be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.<br/><br/>Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.<br/><br/>The massive walk-in closet had been Camille&#x27;s wedding gift to me. &quot;So you&#x27;ll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,&quot; she&#x27;d said, hugging me tight.<br/><br/>Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she&#x27;d still loved me. Still trusted me.<br/><br/>Idiot.<br/><br/>I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I&#x27;d wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.<br/><br/>She&#x27;d always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.<br/><br/>Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.<br/><br/>My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who&#x27;d walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.<br/><br/>But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.<br/><br/>Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.<br/><br/>&quot;Oh, Camille,&quot; I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. &quot;What have you done to yourself?&quot;<br/><br/>But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille&#x27;s eyes before she&#x27;d walked out, I&#x27;d never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.<br/><br/>It had looked almost like... understanding.<br/><br/>Like she&#x27;d finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.<br/><br/>I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I&#x27;d made her. She&#x27;d run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.<br/><br/>But she&#x27;d never be free of me. I&#x27;d made sure of that years ago.<br/></p><p></p><div class="pagination"><a href="2.html">« Prev</a><a href="4.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
