Not the physical changes, but the transformation happening inside. Was this who I was becoming? Someone who could dream of her own sister&#x27;s death and feel pleasure rather than horror?<br/><br/>Sleep eluded me for the rest of the night. I sat by the window, watching city lights glitter in the darkness, trying to untangle the knot of emotions inside me. By dawn, I&#x27;d reached no conclusions, just a dull acceptance that something fundamental was shifting within me. Something that might be necessary for what lay ahead, but frightening nonetheless.<br/><br/>Two more days passed in the recovery suite before Victoria declared it time to return to the mansion. The bruising had faded enough to be covered by makeup, the swelling reduced to subtle puffiness only I would notice.<br/><br/>As James drove us back, Victoria reviewed upcoming appointments on her tablet. &quot;The board wants to officially announce you as my heir at next quarter&#x27;s shareholders meeting. We&#x27;ll need professional portraits before then. Dr. Torres suggests another three weeks before scheduling the photo session.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, only half-listening, still caught in thoughts of my disturbing dream.<br/><br/>&quot;Your silence suggests either disinterest or distraction,&quot; Victoria observed, setting aside her tablet. &quot;Which is it?&quot;<br/><br/>I turned from the window to face her. &quot;I had a dream about Rose. About watching her drown and... enjoying it.&quot;<br/><br/>I expected judgment, perhaps even concern about my psychological state. Instead, Victoria&#x27;s expression remained neutral, assessing.<br/><br/>&quot;And this troubles you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Shouldn&#x27;t it?&quot; I asked. &quot;She&#x27;s still my sister.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is she?&quot; Victoria&#x27;s question hung in the air between us. &quot;The woman who orchestrated your husband&#x27;s betrayal? Who manipulated your parents against you for years? Who celebrated while the world thought you dead? Does sharing blood with such a person obligate you to forgiveness?&quot;<br/><br/>Put that way, it sounded rational, even obvious. But something still twisted uncomfortably in my stomach.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not about forgiveness,&quot; I said slowly. &quot;It&#x27;s about who I&#x27;m becoming. The person in that dream, the one who smiled while watching her sister drown, I didn&#x27;t recognize her.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied me for a long moment before responding. &quot;Transformation isn&#x27;t just physical, Camille. Your face changes, yes, but so does your heart. Your mind. Your soul, if you believe in such things.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to my altered features. &quot;What Dr. Torres did was merely the external manifestation of an internal process already underway. The woman who can dismantle Rose&#x27;s world cannot be the same woman Rose once destroyed.&quot;<br/><br/>The car pulled into the mansion&#x27;s driveway, gravel crunching beneath the tires. Victoria gathered her things, preparing to exit, but paused before opening her door.<br/><br/>&quot;Your dream doesn&#x27;t show corruption,&quot; she said, her voice unexpectedly gentle. &quot;It shows preparation. Your mind is readying itself for what your heart still resists.&quot;<br/><br/>With that, she stepped from the car, leaving me to follow when ready.<br/><br/>That night, in my suite at the mansion, I stood before the full-length mirror in my bathroom, lights bright enough to hide nothing. Unwrapped the soft bandage Dr. Torres had applied for sleeping. Studied every changed angle of my face with critical eyes.<br/><br/>The woman looking back at me seemed both familiar and foreign. I recognized the core of my features, the basic blueprint remained. But the enhancements had transformed me into someone who commanded attention rather than blended into backgrounds. Someone who looked like she belonged in Victoria&#x27;s world of power and privilege.<br/><br/>I remembered Rose at my wedding, standing beside me in photos, somehow always managing to outshine the bride. Her subtle positioning to catch the best light, her practiced smile that photographers always loved. She&#x27;d spent a lifetime learning how to be seen, how to be the center of every frame.<br/><br/>Now I would learn the same. But for a different purpose.<br/><br/>Turning away from the mirror, I moved to my desk where files awaited review, Rose&#x27;s growing fashion business, Stefan&#x27;s latest projects, my parents&#x27; social calendar. Information gathered by Victoria&#x27;s team, delivered daily to keep me informed of the lives continuing without me.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s designs were good, better than I&#x27;d expected. She had genuine talent beneath the manipulative exterior. Her business plan showed surprising acumen. The investor meetings lined up for the coming months represented real opportunity for growth.<br/><br/>All of which would make it more satisfying when I eventually controlled whether she succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>The thought should have disturbed me. A month ago, it would have. Now, it felt like stepping into a role I was born to play.<br/><br/>I closed the files and returned to the mirror, studying my new face one more time. In the dream, Rose had looked into these eyes and seen something that terrified her. Soon, that dream would become reality.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re not erasing you,&quot; Dr. Torres had said. &quot;We&#x27;re amplifying your power.&quot;<br/><br/>She was right. The face looking back at me now wasn&#x27;t a disguise. It was a revelation. The woman I might have become naturally, if life hadn&#x27;t beaten me down for so many years. If Rose hadn&#x27;t systematically undermined my confidence. If Stefan hadn&#x27;t betrayed me. If my parents hadn&#x27;t always preferred their adopted daughter.<br/><br/><div class="pagination"><a href="15.html">« Prev</a><a href="17.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
