My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars. It was late, past midnight,  but something felt wrong. Off.<br/><br/>My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.<br/><br/>A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.<br/><br/>I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose&#x27;s number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.<br/><br/>Perfect.<br/><br/>Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.<br/><br/>I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel&#x27;s elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...<br/><br/>&quot;Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?&quot;<br/><br/>A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.<br/><br/>Not a random attack, then.<br/><br/>&quot;Actually, it&#x27;s Ms. Lewis now.&quot; My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. &quot;And I have a dinner reservation, so if you&#x27;ll excuse me...&quot;<br/><br/>The first man smiled. It wasn&#x27;t a nice smile. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid your plans have changed.&quot;<br/><br/>I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I&#x27;d started carrying after signing the divorce papers. &quot;Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Our employer prefers to remain anonymous.&quot; He stepped closer. &quot;Now, we can do this the easy way...&quot;<br/><br/>I didn&#x27;t let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.<br/><br/>He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.<br/><br/>Almost there. Just a few more...<br/><br/>Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.<br/><br/>&quot;That wasn&#x27;t very nice.&quot; The first man&#x27;s voice was rough with pain and rage. &quot;Hold her.&quot;<br/><br/>Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.<br/><br/>&quot;Our employer said you might be difficult.&quot; The first man wiped his streaming eyes. &quot;Said you needed to learn your place.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.<br/><br/>&quot;If you&#x27;re going to kill me,&quot; I spat, &quot;at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.&quot;<br/><br/>He laughed. &quot;Kill you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don&#x27;t know when to let go.&quot;<br/><br/>The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.<br/><br/>&quot;See, some people don&#x27;t understand their role in life.&quot; Another blow, this one to my ribs. &quot;Some people need to be taught...&quot;<br/><br/>I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn&#x27;t cry. Wouldn&#x27;t give Rose the satisfaction.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s enough.&quot;<br/><br/>The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.<br/><br/>My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...<br/><br/>A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.<br/><br/>But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.<br/><br/>&quot;Ma&#x27;am,&quot; one of my attackers started, &quot;our employer...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is about to have a very bad day.&quot; The woman&#x27;s voice was ice. &quot;Release her. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.<br/><br/>&quot;Secure them.&quot; The woman&#x27;s command sent her men moving. My attackers didn&#x27;t even try to run. They knew better.<br/><br/>She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille Lewis.&quot; Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.<br/><br/>I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. &quot;Do I know you?&quot;<br/><br/>Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone  else in my face.<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. &quot;But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.&quot;<br/><br/>The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.<br/><br/>&quot;Who...&quot; I swayed, darkness creeping in. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br/><br/>She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.<br/><br/>&quot;Someone who&#x27;s been watching you for a very long time, Camille.&quot; Her voice seemed to come from far away. &quot;Someone who&#x27;s going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.&quot;<br/><br/>The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:<br/><br/>&quot;After all... you look just like my daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>Then nothing but black.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="4.html">« Prev</a><a href="6.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
