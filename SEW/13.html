Your light was too bright for this world. #SisterLove #Forever&quot;<br/><br/>Beneath it, dozens of sympathetic comments. Friends who&#x27;d never questioned her role in my marriage&#x27;s end. Acquaintances eager to attach themselves to her grief narrative.<br/><br/>And Stefan, commenting with a simple heart emoji. The man who&#x27;d handed me divorce papers on our anniversary, now publicly mourning the wife he&#x27;d discarded.<br/><br/>&quot;Enough,&quot; I said finally, closing the laptop. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen what I needed to see.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied me carefully. &quot;And what do you feel?&quot;<br/><br/>I searched myself, digging for the hurt, the rage, the betrayal that should be there. Instead, I found something colder, more focused. Like looking at specimens in a lab.<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing,&quot; I answered honestly. &quot;They&#x27;re strangers performing in a play.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile was approving. &quot;Good. Emotional detachment is essential for what comes next.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to the rest of the files on her desk. &quot;Your new life awaits, Camille. Elite education. Investment prodigy. My reclusive adopted daughter finally emerging to take her place in my empire.&quot;<br/><br/>I picked up my new passport, thumb brushing over the name embossed in gold. Camille Kane. A woman who&#x27;d never been hurt by Rose. Never been betrayed by Stefan. Never been overlooked by parents who preferred their adopted daughter.<br/><br/>&quot;And if someone recognizes me? Someone who knew Camille Lewis?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression turned serious. &quot;Your new life must be impenetrable. If anyone connects Camille Kane to Camille Lewis, everything we&#x27;ve built collapses.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How do we prevent that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;First, appearance.&quot; She gestured to my hair. &quot;Tomorrow morning, our stylists will transform you. New cut, new color, subtle changes that create distance from your former self.&quot;<br/><br/>I touched my long brown waves, another piece of the old me about to disappear. &quot;What else?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Body language. Speech patterns. The way you walk, the way you hold a glass, the way you respond to questions. We&#x27;ve arranged sessions with a behavioral coach who works with intelligence agencies. He&#x27;ll help eliminate tells that might connect you to your former self.&quot;<br/><br/>The thoroughness of the plan was both impressive and terrifying. Victoria had thought of everything, anticipated every potential crack in my new identity.<br/><br/>&quot;And most importantly,&quot; she continued, &quot;limited exposure to anyone who knew Camille Lewis. For at least the first year, you&#x27;ll avoid any setting where you might encounter old connections.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And after that?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes gleamed. &quot;After that, when your new identity is firmly established, when the world has accepted Camille Kane without question, then we begin the real work.&quot;<br/><br/>She opened another file, this one containing financial reports, business plans, investment portfolios.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose has expanded her boutique into a small fashion line. She&#x27;s seeking five million in startup capital. Her current business plan is remarkably solid, I must admit.&quot;<br/><br/>I glanced at the numbers, the projections, seeing the dream my sister had likely been nurturing even while pretending to support my marriage. &quot;And?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Kane Ventures will be very interested in her proposal. So interested that I&#x27;m sending my protégée, you... to handle the potential investment personally.&quot;<br/><br/>The image formed in my mind instantly. Me, transformed, powerful, wealthy beyond imagination sitting across from Rose, holding her dreams in my hands. Her not recognizing the sister she&#x27;d betrayed, now positioned to grant or destroy her future.<br/><br/>&quot;How long?&quot; I asked. &quot;How long until I can face her as Camille Kane?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;One year. Perhaps eighteen months. Time for your &#x27;death&#x27; to fade from memory. Time for your new identity to solidify. Time for you to master every skill you&#x27;ll need to dismantle their world piece by piece.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, a plan forming. Not just revenge, but justice. Not just destruction, but reconstruction. Taking back everything they&#x27;d stolen from me and more.<br/><br/>Victoria handed me a final document, a schedule that spanned months, detailing my transformation from Camille Lewis to Camille Kane. Language lessons. Etiquette training. Finance courses. Self-defense classes. Public speaking workshops. A complete rebuilding from the ground up.<br/><br/>&quot;It begins tomorrow,&quot; she said. &quot;5 AM. Personal trainer. 7 AM. Hair and styling. 9 AM. Diction coach. 11 AM. Press conference preparation. 2 PM. Official introduction to the board of Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>The day stretched before me, the first of many that would forge me into someone new. Someone stronger. Someone capable of executing the justice I deserved.<br/><br/>Victoria opened her desk drawer and withdrew a small velvet box. &quot;One last thing.&quot;<br/><br/>Inside was a pendant, a silver phoenix rising from flames, suspended on a platinum chain. Diamonds formed the bird&#x27;s wings, catching light as she held it up.<br/><br/>&quot;My gift to you. A reminder of what you&#x27;re becoming.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved behind me, fastening the necklace around my throat. The pendant settled against my skin, cool at first, then warming.<br/><br/>&quot;From the ashes of what they did to you,&quot; she murmured, her hands resting briefly on my shoulders. &quot;From the fire they thought would destroy you.&quot;<br/><br/>I touched the phoenix, feeling its weight against my collarbone. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria returned to her desk, gathering the files into neat stacks. &quot;Everything is in place. Your new identity, your education, your backstory. Now we need only set the pieces in motion.&quot;<br/><br/>She pressed another button on her phone. &quot;Send in the surveillance team.&quot;<br/><br/>Moments later, three men entered the office. James, who I&#x27;d seen earlier, and two others in similar dark suits. They carried tablets and folders, standing at attention until Victoria nodded for them to approach.<br/><br/>&quot;Updates,&quot; she commanded.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Lewis and Mr. Rodriguez returned from Greece this morning,&quot; James reported, handing her his tablet.<br/><br/>&quot;And the parents?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;The Lewises are maintaining appearances,&quot; another man reported. &quot;Charity functions, social obligations. Mrs. Lewis has increased her anxiety medication. Mr. Lewis has been spending more time at his club than at home.&quot;<br/><br/>Small cracks in their perfect facade. Just the beginning.<br/><br/>&quot;Financial status?&quot; Victoria directed this question to the third man.<br/><br/>&quot;Lewis Industries stock has dropped eight percent since the memorial service. Initial sympathy has faded, and investors are questioning Mr. Lewis&#x27;s focus. The Rodriguez family business remains stable, though there are rumors of tension between Stefan and his father regarding the hasty relationship to Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, satisfied. &quot;Continue monitoring. I want updates daily. Focus particularly on Rose&#x27;s business activities. Every investor she approaches, every meeting she takes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>They departed as silently as they&#x27;d arrived, leaving me alone again with Victoria and the scattered remnants of my fabricated life.<br/><br/>&quot;Well?&quot; she asked, studying my reaction. &quot;Does this satisfy you? Knowing they&#x27;re being watched? Knowing we see every move they make?&quot;<br/><br/>I considered the question, searching my feelings. The photos should have hurt. The news of them in Greece should have enraged me. Instead, I felt strangely detached, as if watching characters in a film I&#x27;d already seen.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; I answered honestly. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t satisfy me.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria raised an eyebrow. &quot;No?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Watching isn&#x27;t enough. Knowledge isn&#x27;t enough.&quot; I picked up the photo of Rose and Stefan on their vacation, her face glowing with triumph, his arm possessively around her waist. &quot;They&#x27;re happy. They believe they&#x27;ve won.&quot;<br/><br/>I set the photo down, turning it face-down on the desk. &quot;I don&#x27;t want reports about their lives. I want control over their lives. I want them to build dreams I can shatter. Create hopes I can destroy. Construct a future I can dismantle.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile spread slowly, pride evident in her eyes. &quot;And you shall have that opportunity. But first, you must become someone they would never suspect. Someone they would trust with their aspirations.&quot;<br/><br/>I looked at the stack of documents that created Camille Kane, the foundation of my new existence. &quot;When do we begin dismantling their happiness?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The moment you&#x27;re ready,&quot; Victoria promised. &quot;The moment Camille Kane is real enough, solid enough to withstand their scrutiny.&quot;<br/><br/>She gathered the surveillance photos, sliding them into a folder. &quot;For now, focus on becoming. On shedding the last traces of the woman they hurt. On building the woman who will destroy them.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, understanding the path before me. A long game. A patient revenge. Not the quick satisfaction of confrontation, but the deeper pleasure of orchestrated downfall.<br/><br/>&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; I said, gathering my new identity papers. &quot;We begin tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Standing straighter, I faced Victoria with new determination. &quot;I&#x27;m ready.&quot;<br/><br/>She nodded once, satisfaction evident in her eyes. &quot;Then let us begin.&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="12.html">« Prev</a><a href="14.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
