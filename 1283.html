  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered with a cold smirk. "Looks like I really overestimated you&mdash;as well as the strength of Transcendent Deities. Or maybe you're just the weakest among them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Osborne felt a wave of disappointment wash over him as he assessed Eamon's capabilities. This wasn't the formidable image of a Transcendent Deity warrior he'd been expecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the fight began, he had assumed that a warrior of this caliber would at least be able to injure him with ease, if not kill him outright. Osborne had even mentally prepared to use the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to recover from any injuries or even revive himself if things got dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was happening before him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon seemed to have given it his all, yet he had barely managed to chip away at Osborne's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't even left a mark on Osborne's Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known Eamon was this </span><span>weak</span><span>, he wouldn't have needed to tread so carefully in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking laugh escaped him, shattering the stillness as it lodged a thorn deep in Eamon's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow struck home, leaving Eamon's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Me? The weakest Transcendent Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He overestimated me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overestimated Transcendent Deities? How dare he!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I possibly be weak? Even in the Age of Gods, I would rank among the </span><span>upper middle of Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I possess a Level Five Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wield a Level Five pinnacle elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My divine power is pure and overflowing&mdash;right in line with what defines a standard Transcendent Deity warrior! Any typical Superior Deity wouldn't even last three hits against me. I could take on ten or twenty and still emerge victorious, albeit with some costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this fool has the audacity to call me the weakest of my kind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon felt a deep sense of humiliation wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it, kid! Underestimating me? I'll rip your head off and crush every bone in your body! </span><span>You're</span><span> dead meat!" he roared, his voice a low growl laced with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eamon unleashed his divine power once again, pouring every ounce of strength he had into a surge that threatened to overwhelm Osborne like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, Osborne wasn't going to play the passive role anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had a clearer sense of Eamon's abilities, he felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to take my head? Break my bones? Think again!" Osborne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne vanished and reappeared behind Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's attack collided with empty space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's fist, full of raw power, slammed into Eamon's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's Ethereal Glow rippled violently, and he couldn't hold back a mouthful of blood from erupting as shock and disbelief painted his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened? He was right in front of me! How could he possess such strong power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here he was, feeling the force of Osborne's punch pierce through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his Divine Body remained intact, Eamon couldn't ignore the stinging pain that radiated inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like his insides were shaking, leaving him gasping for breath and crimson spilling from his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, fear began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But decades of battle experience kicked in, and Eamon quickly shook off the dread. He </span><span>spun around and retaliated,</span><span> his own fists poised to strike Osborne from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" he yelled, only to realize that Osborne had vanished once again, reappearing right behind him with another punch on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly astonished, as if the very fabric of reality had unraveled before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon mused, "How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he move this fast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like there's no delay! One moment he's in front of me, and the next, he's at my back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't keep up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift, powerful punch, Osborne struck Eamon's back once more, sending him crashing to the ground, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth like a crimson flag of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What followed was a relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved like a wraith, appearing in Eamon's blind spots with uncanny precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time Eamon swung to strike, he found nothing but air, while Osborne's fists landed effortlessly on his back, each blow amplifying the pain and fear that coursed through Eamon's veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if countless versions of Osborne were surrounding him, all launching a coordinated attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bizarre and terrifying fighting style only served to magnify the dread swelling in Eamon's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid&mdash;terrified, in fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amid the chaos, Osborne felt a twinge of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Temporal Stasis ability of Satan's Eye doesn't work as well on a Transcendent Deity warrior whose realm is two levels above mine. I can only freeze Eamon's time for one second at most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, that's enough time for me to dodge his attacks and reposition for a counter, but it's just too short to gather enough power for a decisive blow," Osborne mused, frustration creeping into his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Eamon, Osborne's movements seemed almost ghostly. This was all thanks to the constant application of Satan's Eye, which halted time around Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eamon lunged forward, Osborne activated Temporal Stasis, slipping away from his original spot and reappearing behind Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Eamon's attack resumed, he was left swinging at nothing, while Osborne struck again with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tactic was something Osborne had learned from Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first time using it against a Transcendent Deity warrior, and while it was effective for playing with Eamon, it wasn't enough to deliver a killing blow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
