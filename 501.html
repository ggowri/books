  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne and Clarissa returned to Augustine Estate, Isaac, who had already been informed, was there waiting at the gate with the entire Augustine clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of them stared at Osborne with an intense, almost fervent gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long before, Isaac, the elder, had issued a family decree, summoning all the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>&mdash;whether direct descendants or branch family members. Everyone was ordered to drop whatever they were doing and come to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in front of everyone, Isaac made a shocking announcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker family, the Luther family, the Marion family, and the Hawthorne family&mdash;four ancient families&mdash;had mobilized their entire forces to hunt down their heir, Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some shouted that they should rush to Osborne's aid and that they needed to declare war on the four ancient families and make them pay. But many more were worried, even terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, each of those four ancient families was just as powerful as the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>, if not more so. And now they were united against them. How could the Augustine family possibly stand against such a force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there any hope left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many of the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> felt despair. Some suggested they should flee </span><span>Dampston</span><span> immediately, to preserve the Augustine legacy. Others argued they should beg the four ancient families for mercy and offer vast sums of wealth in exchange for peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family was divided, with people voicing different opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Isaac spoke again, dropping another bombshell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forces that had been targeting the Augustine family all this time were, in fact, an alliance of the Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family. They were the ones who had been supporting Ghost Ship, which had been attacking the Augustine family's cruise ships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous family head, Allen, had been killed by Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the Marion family and the Hawthorne family had also joined forces with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. That was why they were hunting down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were even more shocked, their hatred for the ancient families growing deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, their fear intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone believed that the Augustine family could never stand up to these ancient families. They were convinced that once Osborne was killed, they'd all be doomed, and the Augustine family would be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As everyone debated whether they should flee </span><span>Dampston</span><span> immediately, Isaac delivered yet another stunning piece of news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already killed Shawn, Yaron, Emery, and Dexter, along with all the top fighters of the four ancient families, including fifteen Class A warriors and more than forty Class A- fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those four ancient families were done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's words left the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> in silence for a full minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a wave of disbelief and excitement swept through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were in shock. Just moments ago, they'd been despairing, convinced they couldn't possibly stand against the four ancient families. And now, Osborne had single-handedly wiped out all their top fighters?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four ancient families were finished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had won?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe it, but the truth was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Osborne and Clarissa finally arrived at the Augustine Estate, the thousands of </span><span>Augustines</span><span> greeted him with eyes filled with unbridled admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's prestige reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by Isaac, the elders of the Augustine family stepped forward to greet Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elder, is everything ready?" Osborne asked with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac nodded excitedly. "Yes, Osborne, everything's ready. Everyone has been gathered for you to speak to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and smiled, "Let's get started then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne stepped onto a platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the entire Augustine clan erupted in frenzied cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and raised an arm. The crowd fell silent, but their eyes still burned with fervent devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned the area, taking in the sight of the thousands of </span><span>Augustines</span><span>. </span><span>Seeing the fervor in their eyes, he smiled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he spoke, "Everyone, Elder Isaac has already told you what happened. The four ancient families joined forces, mobilizing all their top fighters to hunt me down, only to be wiped out by me instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent another wave of disbelief through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you really killed all of them? The top fighters of those four ancient families are all dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's booming voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was flushed, for he was still unable to believe that the news was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these were the four ancient families they were talking about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one of them was far more powerful than the Augustine family, with over a dozen Class A warriors between them. And now they were all dead, killed by Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed too incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and nodded. "That's right. All the top fighters of those four ancient families are dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused and continued, "They've been plotting against us in the shadows, colluding with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and they even tried to kill me. Our enmity with them runs deep. Now is the time for us to take our revenge! I've gathered you all here to announce that from this moment on, the Augustine family is declaring war on the Walker family, the Luther family, the Marion family, and the Hawthorne family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, "Everyone who can fight, prepare to move out immediately! Surround the estates of the four ancient families! If anyone tries to run, kill them! If anyone resists, kill them! If anyone refuses to submit, kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice rang out loud and clear. Instantly, the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> were whipped into a frenzy, their eyes filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone shouted at the top of their lungs, faces flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, under the direction of the Augustine family elders, they surged out of Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the Walker Estate and Marion Estate, just a short distance away, were surrounded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
