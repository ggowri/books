  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne completed his Vampire transformation, the black sword light pierced through the red Devil's Light's defense, slashing across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wound appeared on Osborne's chest, and his expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still cannot block it, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that is the case, I will shatter you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered. Despite his Vampire transformation making his body incredibly resilient, it still could not withstand the black sword light, which was about to split him in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, his blood-red hair suddenly whipped around, growing rapidly and wrapping around the black sword light layer by layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shatter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared, throwing a punch with immense force at the black sword light. The impact caused the sword light to tremble violently, on the verge of collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo had been confident that this strike would kill Osborne, but now Apollo watched in disbelief as Osborne transformed into Vampire, his eerie hair entangled the sword light and almost shattered it with a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's confidence disappeared in an instant, replaced by shock and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having exhausted all his strength with that one strike, Apollo had no power left for a second one. Seeing that he could not kill Osborne, he turned to flee without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne would not let him escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to flee? Stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, his blood-red hair extending over a hundred yards to bind the fleeing Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's face turned pale, and he struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was severely injured and almost drained of strength, making it impossible to break free from Osborne's blood-red hair, which suppressed his powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he was bound, Apollo felt his power dissipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted in fear. "Father, save me! Quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's cry echoed through the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, Derek's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless! What a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with the family's ancestral sword, you could not kill your opponent. Now you want me to save you? You are a disgrace to the Chevalier family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his harsh words, Derek immediately moved to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Apollo was his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a young age, Apollo had shown exceptional talent, becoming a Class B metahuman before turning thirty. Besides The Wise Order, only Derek, a Class B+ metahuman, was stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek had always seen Apollo as the next head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Derek could not bear to see Apollo die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek roared, his voice thundering. He extended his hand, summoning a terrifying tornado that crossed the thousand-yard distance, aiming to save Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, a dimensional rift appeared in the void, swallowing Derek's tornado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned angrily towards Orion Lark, shouting, "Orion, you are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Apollo, Orion was only a Class B metahuman, lower in rank than Derek. He manipulated spatial power to open a dimensional rift and absorb Derek's tornado, putting a huge strain on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Derek's rebuke, Orion smiled faintly. "Mr. Chevalier, you are overstepping. This is a fair duel. Your earlier interference with the Chevalier family's ancestral sword already broke the rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you want to help Apollo again? You are disregarding us! Since you invited us to witness, we have the right to ensure fairness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would not let you intervene."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Orion finished speaking, other representatives from ancient families nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, please respect the fairness of this duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, it is best for you to continue viewing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words made Derek's face even darker. Clenching his fists, he quickly glanced at Apollo's predicament, seeing him unable to break free. Derek was filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and roared, "What if I insist on intervening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion smiled faintly, "Then do not blame us for stopping you. Even though you are a Class B+ metahuman, with so many of us, we can hold you off for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, you are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion looked disdainful. "Mr. Chevalier, you would better worry about Apollo. He seems to be dying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face changed dramatically as he looked towards the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was tightly bound by Osborne's blood-red hair, unable to move, and Derek's rescue attempt had been thwarted by Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's face turned deathly pale as he watched Osborne approach with a sneer and killing intent in his eyes. Red Devil's Light appeared in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, it is time for you to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, striking Apollo's head with his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo shouted in desperation. "I am the eldest son of the Chevalier family and a member of the Hall of Gods. If you kill me, you will have no place to bury your body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop, I surrender..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Apollo could finish speaking, his head exploded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
