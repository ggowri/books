  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the formation of ordinary Essence Crystals came with its own set of conditions. They required an environment rich in natural energy, often accompanied by extreme heat or pressure, before they could crystallize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had seen all sorts of Essence Crystal mines, and even those that produced low-grade Essence Crystals were always located deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he encountered a mine where Essence Crystals could be picked up right off the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just any Essence Crystals</span><span>. T</span><span>hese were Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Celestial Crystal contained energy equivalent to ten billion low-grade Essence Crystals, enough for an ordinary Junior Deity to reach the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, the energy within a single Celestial Crystal was comparable to the total energy of a peak Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the purity of Celestial Crystal energy was unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the dense energy present at Divine Peak Nine, and despite the canyon being a gathering point for natural forces, the sheer number of Celestial Crystals was astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already amassed close to a million, and he suspected there were even more hidden below the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he suspected that there must be even more crystals and a secret hidden in the depths of the canyon, possibly some kind of treasure that had caused the abundance of divine crystals in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could be the reason for all this?" Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he controlled one of his Spatial Clones, he ventured deeper into the mine, determined to uncover the source of this incredible bounty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Spatial Clone came to an abrupt halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself at the end of the Celestial Crystal vein, and what he saw left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the tunnel lay a withered root, a massive structure that had long since decayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Parts of it still bore the faint outline of its original form, marked by charred scars that hinted at a lightning strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding this decayed root were clusters of Celestial Crystals, each radiating a dazzling spectrum of colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief as he took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the incredibly rich, pure energy emanating from the withered root</span><span>, which was </span><span>much more refined than that of the Celestial Crystals themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that all the Celestial Crystals surrounding him were manifestations of this root's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?" Osborne gasped, momentarily frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shock stemmed not just from the revelation of the Celestial Crystals' origin but </span><span>from the familiarity of the root before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its withered and charred state, Osborne recognized its patterns and form all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a terrifying memory surged to the forefront of his mind</span><span>, </span><span>a recollection from when he had been lost in the depths of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal root had loomed over him, darkening the skies and instilling fear even in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. That root had casually struck him down</span><span> and </span><span>shatter</span><span>ed</span><span> his Divine Body time and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, granting him immortality and the ability to revive, he would have perished countless times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That terrifying root had even severely wounded the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a force so powerful that even the former God of Night had been powerless against it while this root had effortlessly dealt a crushing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That root creature was definitely the most terrifying existence Osborne had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, standing before this same root</span><span>, </span><span>though withered and decayed</span><span>, </span><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy radiating from it brought back memories of fear, causing his body to tremble involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought in disbelief, "The Celestial Crystals here... they're formed from the root?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of existence can produce millions of Celestial Crystals from just a decayed root? How can a single piece of it contain such terrifying and pure energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why has this root appeared here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of formidable being could sever such a root?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a considerable amount of time for Osborne to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what this root truly is, but it has to be stronger than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! And whatever entity is capable of severing it must be on the same level.</span><span> </span><span>This is not something I can mess with!</span><span> </span><span>I need to gather all the Celestial Crystals and get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With urgency, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single Celestial Crystal scattered around him had originated from the root, likely the result of a tremendous explosion or battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time and swiftly gathered all the Celestial Crystals in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he collected them all, Osborne turned his attention back to the section of the root that hadn't yet transformed into crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy emanating from it was even purer and more concentrated than that found in the Celestial Crystals. Osborne could sense something akin to the Miracle Elixir radiating from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This root has to come with me. Despite its decayed and rotted state, its value far exceeds the millions of Celestial Crystals I've just collected!" Osborne thought to himself as he prepared to store the root in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to make his move, something unexpected happened.</span></p><div class="pagination">
