  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled with a hint of confidence in his eyes, "If you think you can take revenge, then by all means, come at me! Just remember, you might end up worse off than her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley scoffed, his expression hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can't deny it&mdash;you're strong. I admit I underestimated you before, and so did everyone else. Even now, with over forty percent of your power drained, I can't say I'm guaranteed a win against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep growing like this, you could become a massive threat to us </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and said a smirk, "So, are you saying you're ready to throw in the towel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley laughed coldly. "Throw in the towel? Ha! Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have the right to make me concede. What I'm saying is, under normal circumstances, I can't be sure I can beat you, but that doesn't mean I'm afraid of you. Today, I will win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Bradley suddenly produced a pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bizarre shade of blood red, pulsating with an intense energy. Osborne focused, and his expression shifted to one of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside that pill, he sensed a power of an entirely different level</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could react, Bradley swallowed the pill in one swift motion. Instantly, his face turned crimson, and a terrifying energy erupted from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony, while divine artifacts were banned, challengers were free to use potions to boost their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most participants were Class AAA elites, and few substances could significantly enhance their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this wasn't absolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know exactly what Bradley had just taken, but he was certain it would amplify Bradley's strength. Otherwise, Bradley wouldn't be so confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More alarmingly, Osborne could feel the divine power radiating from the pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air as the overwhelming force from Bradley intensified. With each passing moment, his muscles swelled, stretching his clothes to their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power surged like a tidal wave, growing stronger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't afford to wait any longer!" Osborne thought, sensing the imminent threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he launched himself at Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he was at Bradley's side, delivering a powerful kick right to Bradley's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was explosive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley stumbled back a couple of steps, his cheeks flushed, but he quickly regained </span><span>his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watching you effortlessly take down other challengers from the sidelines, I thought they were weak. But now, after feeling your hit, I realize it's not that they were pathetic; it's that you're genuinely strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, his grin widening. "But unfortunately for you, your strength isn't enough to beat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bradley charged forward, aiming a kick at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened, and he raised his arms defensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent shockwaves through Osborne's arms, causing him to stagger back several feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having transformed into a Vampire and more than doubling his strength, he had just lost in a direct clash of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What incredible strength!" Osborne thought, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he remained calm. Taking a deep breath, he inhaled the air from hundreds of yards around him, unleashing the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his power surge, doubling once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!" Osborne shouted, launching a powerful punch at Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Bradley clenched his fist, ready to meet Osborne head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was like two cannonballs colliding, an explosive sound that threatened to shatter the spectators' eardrums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce shockwave erupted, twisting into a tornado shape on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Bradley were knocked back, but the results were telling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne staggered three steps while Bradley only took two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of surprise flashed across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "I've unleashed the Breath of Celestial, and I'm still slightly weaker than Bradley? The gap isn't huge, but it's there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of pills has he taken to gain such strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, and his brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley smirked, his confidence radiating. "Looks like this is your limit! You've got impressive strength. No wonder you've beaten even Scarlett. But I'm stronger now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're going down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait for the humiliation I'm about to deliver. Everything you did to Felicity&mdash;I'll repay you tenfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bradley surged forward, his terrifying power enveloping Osborne in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate; he was ready to clash head-on!</span></p><div class="pagination">
