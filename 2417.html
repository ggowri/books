  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't in a hurry. With Satan's Eye, he could see that the Magma Devourer was still some distance away, and Gerald was still entangling it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a short time, the Magma Devourer won't be able to come over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, even if the Magma Devourer comes, Osborne isn't afraid. This is a desert, wide and open, so Osborne can use Phantom Steps to easily shake off the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, Flash is faster than the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Have the other contestants gathered together? Did you retreat together? Why didn't the others help you when you were attacked by the Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Leroy and Clara both gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "How could anyone help us? Everyone was panicking, just thinking about escaping as quickly as possible. Gathering together only made us feel safer. When someone was truly in danger, who would leave the group to rescue them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded and said, "The group has gathered now, but no one can convince or lead everyone, so it looks chaotic. Still, staying together is safer. A large number of Abyssal Snakes, Bloody Ivies, and even other creatures from the Abyssal Planet are hunting us. If we act alone, encountering them would mean certain death. If we stick together, at least we have a way to fend them off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, having roughly understood the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> contestants come from different states, cities, and factions, they are unfamiliar with each other and feel unconvinced by one another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although everyone is gathered together, no one can step up to lead and give orders, so naturally, it's chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "To lead these contestants, only Brenda and Valentino could do it. Their strength could barely convince everyone. But Valentino was already stomped to death by the Magma Devourer, and Brenda secretly ran off to the Magma Devourer's lair. So, no one can lead these contestants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided not to bother with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Magma Devourer won't come over for now. Let's collect all these Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snake poison glands first. They can be exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are at least hundreds of Bloody Ivy and thousands of Abyssal Snakes here. One Bloody Ivy can be exchanged for 5,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, and one Abyssal Snake poison gland can be exchanged for 1,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's equivalent to over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening to Osborne, Clara and Leroy immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They spent two days in the desert, constantly hunting Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snakes, but only managed to gather about 500,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Let's collect quickly and catch up with them." Clara and Leroy moved swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they collected 120 Bloody Ivy and 1,200 Abyssal Snake poison glands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, here you go." Clara and Leroy handed all the collected Bloody Ivy and poison glands to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne shook his head and didn&rsquo;t accept.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You keep them. I&rsquo;ve already obtained plenty of resources and treasures. Those treasures can be exchanged for enough Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> for me to achieve a good result."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These things are only worth over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. I don&rsquo;t need them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Clara and Leroy immediately widened their eyes, thinking, "Osborne actually doesn&rsquo;t care about over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>? What exactly did he get?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After exchanging a glance, Clara and Leroy nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "Alright. Then we&rsquo;ll keep them for now. But we&rsquo;re just holding onto them temporarily. If your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> aren&rsquo;t enough to win the championship, we&rsquo;ll give them back to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced in the direction of the Magma Devourer and said, "We should leave here now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne mounted the horse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, he said to Leroy and Clara, "If you don't mind, you can hop on too. Flash is pretty fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could finish, Clara and Leroy smiled and directly mounted the horse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne ordered Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Flash dashed out at an incredible speed, nearly throwing Clara and Leroy off, scaring them into holding tightly onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Osborne's strong back, Clara and Leroy's faces turned slightly red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't think much of it. Following the tracks, they quickly found the main group of contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't approach directly, as the contestants were currently under siege.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were surrounded by a large group of Abyssal Snakes, Bloody Ivy, something like giant eagles, and bees resembling little pigs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murky powder falling from the moths' giant eagle-like wings could penetrate the defense of Sacred Power. When it landed on the contestants, it was like a red-hot branding iron, corroding their skin and flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless screams erupted intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bee-like creatures resembling little pigs were even more formidable. Their speed was incredibly fast. The sharp venomous stingers they shot from their tails could pierce through most people's Sacred Power defenses. Once hit by a stinger, their bodies would instantly be covered in pustules, collapsing to the ground and writhing violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy kept emerging from the desert, launching sneak attacks, biting, or entangling them relentlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was utterly chaotic, with contestants dying from time to time. They wanted to organize a counterattack. After all, they were talented warriors from various states, stronger than the Abyssal Snakes and Bloody Ivy. As long as they could coordinate, they could completely withstand such attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, they simply couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw a few people shouting loudly, hoping others would follow their orders to defend and attack together. However, no one paid attention to them, and everyone else was chaotically attacking in panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but shake his head, feeling a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was about to rush in to save someone but suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A figure swiftly appeared. A powerful Sacred Power erupted around her, instantly killing a swarm of moths and bees nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she took out a ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the ring emitted a glow, creating a massive protective shield that enveloped all the contestants. All the moths, bees, Abyssal Snakes, and Bloody Ivy inside the shield were instantly killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda shouted, "Everyone, quiet! I am Brenda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen to me! Right now, we are in great danger. The terrifying Magma Devourer is hunting us. All the native creatures of Abyssal Planet are swarming toward us, trying to surround and kill us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, only by uniting can we have a chance to survive. Chaos and fighting alone will only get us killed faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I will take command now. Those willing to follow my orders, stay here, and I will lead you to survive as best as we can."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you won't obey me or don't want my command, you can leave now. I won't stop you. But if you die, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda finished speaking decisively, sweeping everyone around with a stern gaze. Instantly, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at her in surprise, their eyes filled with delight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
