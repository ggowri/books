  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne's expression instantly became severe. He thought, "Alexander has become a Class A Power Master. He's so fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been exactly ten days since Osborne came to Dampston. He had already established a firm foothold in the Augustine family. At least The Wise Order had absolute trust in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger generation of the Augustine family also respected Osborne because of Ryan, Nathan, Queenie, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just about to start working hard but received such bad news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander became a Class A Power Master. A 28-year-old Class A Power Master was definitely considered a genius even in Newport City. Alexander would be stronger </span><span>than an ordinary Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will definitely take some time for Alexander to break through and become a Class A Power Master. He needs to adapt to the surge in power and consolidate his realm. Once he stabilizes his realm, I'm afraid the Paltrow family will arrange a marriage between him and Clarissa. I don't have much time left." Osborne's face was extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clarissa was brought to Dampston, she was always under house arrest by Dylan. Osborne had no way to contact her. But through Barlyn, Osborne had always been keeping an eye on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was also practicing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had the blood diamonds Osborne gave her. She wanted to become a Class A Master by absorbing the energy of the blood diamonds because no one would force a Class A Master to marry someone she didn't like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was not easy to become a Class A Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more anxious Clarissa was, the more likely she would have problems. Osborne didn't think that Clarissa could become a Class A Power Master in a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered, "It's up to me now. I cannot let Clarissa marry Alexander. I must defeat Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to go back to his room and continue practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Alexander has already broken through to become a Class A Power Master. If I cannot also break through, I need to become a Class A martial artist in terms of physical fitness. I am not a match for Alexander for now. I must try my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to close the door when he suddenly saw Nathan, who was rushing over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, something happened!" Nathan shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "Tell me slowly. What happened? If you're talking about Alexander's breakthrough to become a Class A Power Master, then there's no need to tell me. I already know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Nathan immediately shook his head. "Osborne, it's not this. An elder from the Paltrow family has come. He is a martial master. He said that you injured Yohan and Lauren and threw them into the sea. You almost killed them. He asked The Wise Order to give the Paltrow family an explanation and asked the Augustine family to hand you over for punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan finished speaking quickly. Yulissa's expression suddenly changed. "How dare they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held her back and said calmly, "Don't worry. This is the Augustine Estate. If someone from the Paltrow family forces The Wise Order to hand me over, The Wise Order won't agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne walked out. "I'm going to see who's he."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne arrived at the conference room in the center of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, two parties were confronting each other in the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was there with Jacob, Layla, and the younger generation, including Ryan, Queenie, and Kaden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opposite Isaac was a tall and robust man with a muscular body, broad back, and firm </span><span>waist. He looked as if he was only in his forties, but his eyes carried a sense of worldly wisdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were Yohan and Lauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's injuries had almost recovered at this time, but his two rows of teeth could no longer grow out. He could only get a set of dentures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was filled with extreme anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, are you going to hand over Osborne or not?" the tall man shouted sternly. His voice was like rolling thunder and sounded domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, sitting in a wheelchair, had a grim expression on his face. "Brad, this is the Augustine Estate. Osborne is the heir and the future head of the Augustine family. You actually want me to hand him over to the Paltrow family? How dare you ask me to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Brad sneered, "The Paltrow family is more powerful. The Paltrow family is one of the top three ancient families in Dampston, while the Augustine family is only at the bottom. The Augustine family only has you as a power master. However, the Paltrow family, with the young master Alexander, who just got promoted, already has two power masters and three martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare to go against the Paltrow family? If you don't hand over Osborne, don't blame us to be rude to you. Yohan and Lauren are the most outstanding young generation of the Paltrow family. Osborne actually dared to hurt them. He must pay the price. If you hand over Osborne voluntarily, he can still survive. If you don't, then wait for his death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad finished speaking with a proud look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in the Augustine Estate, but he did not restrain his temper at all. Brad had an arrogant expression, as if he didn't take anyone in the Augustine family seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face turned extremely ugly. He tightly gripped the armrest of the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac wanted to be angry, but he could only hold it back. Brad was right. The Augustine family only had Isaac as a power master, while the Paltrow family had two power masters and three martial masters. The strength of the Augustine family and the Paltrow family was not equal at all. The Augustine family couldn't afford to offend the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac wondered, "Do I have to hand Osborne over?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
