  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking with them, Osborne learned that it had been over a month since they arrived at Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, time moved ten times faster in Hope Haven, meaning a whole year had passed for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bowman family had issued the Stellar Pursuit Mandate, and now, with over a month gone by, enough talented warriors from various races had gathered from all corners of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement lit up the faces of Bryce and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce exclaimed, and his eyes gleamed with anticipation, "Finally, we can get back into the fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's the plan? We're all ears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly began to think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also reached out to Guy, Darren, and the others to get the latest on the situation in Wild Flame City. After some time, he had a solid plan forming in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family's Stellar Pursuit Mandate has drawn countless talented warriors to Wild Flame City, all eager for the rich rewards on offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our goal is to defeat them and make a name for ourselves in Celestara. This way, we won't have to chase them down one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, here's the idea. Let's host a massive arena challenge! Under the banner of the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings,' we can set up an arena where warriors from all races can come and challenge us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To make it even more enticing, we'll offer substantial rewards. Anyone who can defeat us in the arena will win the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, along with 10 thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rewards we're offering will far surpass those of the Bowman family, and it'll put them to shame while igniting a frenzy among the talented warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can defeat all challengers, the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' will be a household name in Celestara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the group fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive arena challenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of winning the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, along with 10 thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs, was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those rewards were on a whole different level compared to what the Bowman family had offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the sheer value of those prizes could send warriors from every race into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the idea of defeating all the young warriors from various races in the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about it made their blood rush with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah furrowed her brow, concern etched on her face. "But... isn't this a bit risky? "We might not just face the younger warriors. There could be plenty of older, more experienced warriors showing up, too! If they decide to bend the rules and come after us, how will we handle that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly. "You don't need to worry about that! All the races care about their reputations. If their young talents can defeat us, the older warriors won't intervene&mdash;unless they think the younger generation has no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if it comes to that, it'll be a disgrace for them, not us! If they can't resist the urge to step in, it'll only boost our reputation as the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All we need to think about is a safe exit strategy. I've got spatial power, so most of the time, I can help us escape. However, it's not a foolproof guarantee. If a super warrior decides to intervene, my spatial power might not be enough to ensure our safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why we need to pick a special location for our challenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A special location? Where do you have in mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity sparked in the eyes of the group as they turned to Osborne, and they were eager for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled and said, "Right near Divine Peak Nine! If there's a super warrior who can restrict my spatial power, we can always retreat to Divine Peak Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, images of the enormous humanoid statue and the tree roots circling around it in the heart of Divine Peak Nine flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Shadow Terror Fiend and the tree root creatures were extraordinarily terrifying entities, far surpassing even Lord Malevolence in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already planned that if a super warrior he couldn't handle were to attack him and his spatial power was limited, he would flee into Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, his understanding of Divine Peak Nine was deeper than anyone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, once inside Divine Peak Nine, even a super warrior wouldn't be able to easily catch us! So, setting up a challenge platform does involve some risks, but they're all within manageable limits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're confident, we have no objections. Let's take them on! This time, we'll defeat all the geniuses from the various tribes!" Bryce exclaimed, filled with battle fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Alright! I'll have someone spread the message. Our challenge platform needs a name. How about 'Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament'? The champions will be the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity </span><span>Kings'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the tournament, we can set off for West Zone!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
