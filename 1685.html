  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurried to leave Dimensional Microcosm because he had sensed through his outside clone that the Deathborn army was closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 30 thousand of them had </span><span>been</span><span> aware of their king's </span><span>death</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>not only surround</span><span>ed</span><span> Angelo and the others but also </span><span>attacked </span><span>Osborne's clone with a frenzied thirst for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of Deathborn surged forward, ready to tear apart the shadows of the Eternity and obliterate Spatial Clone and Dark Undead within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne returned to the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw the situation around him, a cold smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to Divine Peak Nine with a clear purpose</span><span>, </span><span>to obtain the precious death scent liquid and restore Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. That goal was accomplished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have easily walked away now&mdash;but he didn't want to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystal Mine was just up ahead, and he couldn't pass up the chance to gather some for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he needed to prevent Angelo from getting his hands on Celestial Crystals. So, with determination burning in his chest, he thought, "I'll wipe out this Deathborn Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking care of Angelo and his crew is next on my agenda! If it were before, I might have hesitated. Without my immortality, death would have been... well, death. I couldn't afford to take the risk. But now, I'm invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought locked in, Osborne raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Charge</span><span>! </span><span>Slay</span><span> these Deathborn</span><span>s</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, eight clones erupted from the Eternal Night, each one a deadly blade slicing through the ranks of the Deathborn army. Behind them followed Dark Undead, creating a terrifying wave of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook as the Deathborn, though formidable, proved no match for Osborne's mighty clones. Even the peak Deity Overlord Deathborn they faced could only manage a few defensive moves before being crushed by the overwhelming power of spatial force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't standing idle, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he dove into the heart of the Deathborn forces. The mining area was close, and to secure the Celestial Crystals without interruption, he had to take down everyone in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, the Deathborn army was no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his clones surged forward, they faced an ever-decreasing wall of Deathborn, shattering their ranks and inflicting heavy casualties along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer devastation left Angelo and his group in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were under attack themselves and barely holding their ground thanks to Angelo's formidable powers. Still, defeating the Deathborn army seemed impossible; they had no choice but to wear them down slowly, hoping the fortress could withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was dismantling the Deathborn forces with ruthless efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So many geniuses from Paramount Supreme Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's eyes widened as he witnessed Osborne's clones. His shock was apparent. He didn't realize these were Osborne's extensions. Coupled with Eclipsing Mantra, Osborne had also altered their appearances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Angelo, they looked like a squad of elite talents from Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the truth clicked in his mind. "Wait! Are they using spatial power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angelo quickly shook off his surprise and rallied his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! We can't lose face in front of these geniuses from Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show no weakness! Let's slaughter them relentlessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled again</span><span>, because</span><span> Osborne and Angelo</span><span> </span><span>both wielding power at the Deity King level</span><span> </span><span>plowed through the ranks of Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's clones boasted Deity King's combat strength, making it impossible for the sheer numbers of the Deathborn army to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reinforcements among the Deathborn might keep flooding in, but they were quickly dwindling under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn army was rapidly losing numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as Osborne used the Supreme Malevolence Sword to slay the last of the Deathborn, a profound silence fell over the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo and the others stood there, panting heavily from the exertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had taken a toll on them&mdash;every member of their once ninety-strong team was injured, and now, fewer than fifty remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet in that silence, an exhilaration bubbled up within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encircled by the Deathborn Kingdom's forces, they hadn't just survived, and they had taken down Deathborn King and annihilated the entire army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a victory they could boast about for ages when they returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their injuries and exhausted power, a thrill coursed through their veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, they turned their eyes toward Osborne and his clones with admiration shining in their gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood the gravity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without those nine "Paramount Supreme Clan" geniuses, they would never have managed to conquer the Deathborn army, let alone kill Deathborn King. Aside from Angelo, none of them would have made it out alive if not for their intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those geniuses from Paramount Supreme Clan are </span><span>remarkable</span><span>!" one of them exclaimed, breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all just Deity Overlords, yet they fight like Deity Kings." another added, awe-struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially that leader, Christopher. His mastery of dark power and his ability to wield the esteemed Lord Malevolence's unparalleled techniques are terrifying," someone said, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the other eight. Can you believe it? They all possess spatial power</span><span>! T</span><span>hat</span><span>'s the so-called</span><span> legendary ability! They have to be secretly trained by the esteemed Lord Malevolence." another chimed in with wonder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
