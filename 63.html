  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Alison finished speaking, Osborne roughly understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family was engaged in jewelry design and sales, while the Ashford family dealt with finding natural uncut diamonds. The two wealthy families had great complementarity in business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was also the reason why Ophelia wanted to divorce him and marry Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both the Ashford and Caldwell families wanted to strengthen their cooperation through marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne did not know before that the Ashford family controlled most of the uncut diamonds and semi-finished products in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he needed twenty pounds of the purest and finest diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Given his relationship with Wesley, the Ashford family would never sell them to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What&rsquo;s more, the price of the diamonds he needed were too expensive. Even though he had 660 million dollars in his account, it may not be enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those thoughts made his head spin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His strength would increase significantly once Satan&rsquo;s Eye was upgraded to level three. Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to wait too long. He must get the top-quality diamonds as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Tell me, is there any way to get a large amount of natural top-notch diamonds as quickly as possible?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Natural top-notch diamonds? How much do you want?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Twenty pounds? Do you know how much it costs, Mr. Augustine? Even if it&rsquo;s just ordinary white diamonds, it will cost at least close to one billion! If it&rsquo;s colored diamonds, several billion won&rsquo;t be enough, far from enough.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bitter smile appeared on Osborne&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I know. You just need to tell me where I can get it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison took a deep look at Osborne and said, &ldquo;If you want to get that many diamonds, you can only go buy raw stones. Although the Ashford family won&rsquo;t sell us semi-finished products, the raw diamonds are highly speculative, and anyone can buy them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;However, people who go to dealing markets usually lose money nine out of ten times. You have to be aware if they are really natural diamonds or man-made. They even talk you into buying water-worn quartz pebbles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It is hard to determine the quality and size of diamonds through the skin of the raw stones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you want twenty pounds of top-quality diamonds, you can only go to the diamond dealing market to try your luck. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find the best.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The diamond dealing market?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Buying raw uncut diamonds?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This seemed to be a good idea. After all, Satan&rsquo;s Eye had the ability to see through everything. Others couldn&rsquo;t be sure the quality of raw uncut diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he could try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he could get the finest diamonds from uncut stones, he would definitely be able to save a lot of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most importantly, it could make the Ashford family feel distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he absorbed the special energy in diamonds, he could give them to Alison. She could design and sell them to seize the market for top-level jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And they could also hit the Caldwell Group where it hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could do a lot at one fell swoop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The odds of success were slim, but he had to try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Osborne agreed, &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s buy some gems. Where is the Ashford family&rsquo;s diamond dealing market? Take me there now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne did what he thought and took action immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Mr. Augustine. Just call me Osborne,&rdquo; Osborne said to Alison in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison hesitated for a moment, realized Osborne wanted to hide who he really was, and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, Mr. Augustine. I&rsquo;ll call you by name when there are outsiders.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled and nodded. Everything was easy with a smart assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Godfather had awarded him Luna Jewels but asked him to manage the company, he would have a headache now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, are you sure you want to go to the Ashford family&rsquo;s market? In fact, I strongly advise you not to do this. Buying uncut diamonds is risky. We might as well wait for others to cut it out before bidding.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What he wanted was not a few. If he waited for others to cut them before buying, then what&rsquo;s the difference?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not to mention whether he could afford them or not. Time was everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t wait that long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, he had Satan&rsquo;s eyes. What seemed like a gamble to others was no different from picking up money to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What he was worried about now was whether there were so many top-quality diamonds among the Ashford family&rsquo;s uncut diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You just have to listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne did not explain. The powers of Satan&rsquo;s Eye were the Augustine family&rsquo;s biggest secret. Godfather and he were the only two people who knew it. There was no way he would reveal anything to a third soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Otherwise, if Alison knew he could see through things, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t have sat next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, at the Radcliffe Manor&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia came out of the manor and got in the car with excitement on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley laughed loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect we would turn a disaster into a blessing this time. It was nuts that we happened to run into Ms. Radcliffe being attacked. Although we suffered minor injuries, we received compensation from the Radcliffe family. Moreover, the Radcliffe family promised to do business with us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia also couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;Yes, we got lucky this time. The Radcliffe family&rsquo;s promise is totally worth the injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that I didn&rsquo;t become good friends with Ms. Radcliffe, but at least we left each other our contact information. So, anything is possible.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both of them were bursting with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They didn&rsquo;t know they had already been to the gates of hell. If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t asked Clarissa to save them, they would have been dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They thought it was just a minor injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Radcliffe family&rsquo;s promise gave them hope, and both were full of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I wonder how that loser Osborne is doing now?&rdquo; Wesley suddenly said in a cold voice.</p><div class="pagination">
