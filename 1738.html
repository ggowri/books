  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a punch that crackled with electricity, Anastasia unleashed her power</span><span> and </span><span>shatter</span><span>ed</span><span> Alfred's sword light in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brilliance of her electric strike faded just as quickly, leaving both combatants unscathed, yet the contrast in their expressions spoke volumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's face twisted with rage and disbelief while Anastasia remained eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted among the spectators, their faces painted with incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't blind; they understood the implications of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might have appeared that Anastasia and Alfred were evenly matched, but they all remembered the Supreme Malevolence Sword clutched tightly in Alfred's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack was amplified several times over by that legendary weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, that very sword had enabled him to defeat 10 Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, on the other hand, stood there unarmed, relying solely on her raw strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that respect, Alfred had already suffered a crushing defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!" he growled, teeth clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing impossible about this. Your power is just mediocre! You're merely flaunting the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the Supreme Malevolence Shield!" Anastasia's voice was almost dismissive. "Without those powerful divine artifacts, you wouldn't be able to withstand a single blow from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Alfred like a slap</span><span> and</span><span> deepen</span><span>ed</span><span> the scowl on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience was left in stunned silence, their thoughts racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did she just say? Did she actually claim that Alfred wouldn't withstand a single hit from her without his Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she really from the Human Community, not the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who exactly is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can someone from the Human Community be this talented?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right! They call themselves the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings', and her name is 'Vivienne'! By naming themselves like that, they're comparing themselves to the legendary Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings?! That's audacious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, I thought they were just full of themselves. Now, I feel they might actually be confident about their strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfred is a super genius from the Bowman family, at the peak of the Deity Overlord stage. He's taken down many Deity King warriors! True, the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield give him an edge, but no one can deny his raw power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, it seems like she's not even worried about him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Vivienne! I'll remember their names!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs in the crowd only darkened Alfred's expression further, and his face twisted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill you!" he roared, launching himself at her with renewed fury, his sword </span><span>glowing brighter than before, surging toward Anastasia with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia met his onslaught with unwavering composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder!" she called out, her voice steady as the electric energy danced around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, the air around her erupted in a torrent of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surged outward, consuming Alfred's sword light in its wake. In an instant, the relentless electricity crashed toward him, obliterating anything it encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's eyes widened, but he didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had the Supreme Malevolence Shield to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he quickly regretted his decision not to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crackling sounds filled the air as the dreadful bolts of lightning slammed into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His black shield shattered instantly under immense pressure, the successive thunderous strikes pounding against it until, with a final, resounding blast, the shield broke apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, the terrifying force of the lightning struck directly at Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream escaped his lips as Alfred was hurled backward, crashing into the ground with tremendous force, creating a massive crater upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in the pit, Alfred was charred and twitching uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been utterly overpowered, and the realization of his defeat began to sink in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that single moment, the crowd fell into stunned silence. Whether it was the bystanders in Wild Flame City, members of the Bowman family, or warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan, everyone stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Mystic Feather Clan members looked on, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, once a symbol of power, now appeared feeble before Anastasia, akin to a buzzing mosquito easily swatted away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unexpected turn of events left everyone reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Alfred's prior triumphs over the Deity King warriors of the Mystic Feather Clan, many would have believed he was simply too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth was unmistakable</span><span>. </span><span>Alfred wasn't weak. His opponent was overwhelmingly strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp rippled through the air, echoing the shock in the hearts of those present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bryce, Kendra, Zoe, and Mila were left speechless, exchanging wide-eyed glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce said, managing a wry smile, "Seems like Anastasia never went all out when we sparred. Or maybe she only tapped into a fraction of her true power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra, Zoe, and Mila nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila chimed in, her voice tinged with awe, "I thought I was fairly close to Anastasia, but now I realize she was holding back the whole time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia is incredible! The only one who could possibly rival her is Osborne," Zoe added, her eyes shining with a mix of admiration and envy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
