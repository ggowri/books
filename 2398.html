  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just because there has never been a Master in the Human Community before doesn't mean there won't be one in the future," Osborne said with utmost seriousness. "Are Masters of other races born that way? There will always be pioneers. I believe I can achieve it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne's serious expression, Primordial said helplessly, "Alright. It's good that you have such confidence. But I hope that if one day you truly can't progress any further in your cultivation level, you won't be too discouraged. Let's get back to our previous topic."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking, "I haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness yet, and after Empyrean Sacredness isn't </span><span>it</span><span> Sovereign Level? Thinking about whether I can become a Master now is indeed too early. I just need to keep moving forward firmly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "We just talked about Carbon-based Lifeform, now let's discuss Silicon-based Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silicon-based Lifeform refers to a life form primarily composed of silicon. Unlike Carbon-based Lifeform, Silicon-based Lifeform doesn't need to eat; it only requires energy input to sustain life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Silicon-based Lifeform can survive in extremely harsh environments. In conditions of high temperature, high pressure, high radiation, or extreme cold, Carbon-based Lifeform struggles to survive, but Silicon-based Lifeform adapts with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to Carbon-based Lifeform, Silicon-based Lifeform has a stronger body and greater adaptability. They can quickly enhance their strength without arduous training."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in the cosmos, Silicon-based Lifeform doesn't hold a high status because their intelligence is low. To be precise, they have almost no intelligence, only simple emotions like killing, devouring, and destruction."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the number of Silicon-based Lifeform is small. So, in the cosmos, many people have never even seen them. But this doesn't mean Silicon-based Lifeform isn't powerful..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, another roar interrupted </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words. However, this time the roar seemed farther away than before. Clearly, it hadn't detected Osborne's presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could hear strong emotions of anger and killing in the roar. If he were caught, he would definitely be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that the Silicon-based Lifeform didn't pursue, Primordial also breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, it continued, "The most powerful aspect of Silicon-based Lifeform is their bodies. They possess stronger physiques than the Beast Clan, greater talents and faster growth than the Spirit Clan, and longer lifespans than the Plant Clan. If not for their low intelligence and small numbers, Carbon-based Lifeform wouldn't have had the chance to dominate the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Any Silicon-based Lifeform is extremely troublesome."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial looked toward the direction of the roar. "Based on this roar and the environment here, it is likely a Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Magma Devourer?" Osborne was quite surprised, not expecting Primordial to recognize it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Magma Devourer is a relatively common Silicon-based Lifeform. It can devour magma to enhance its strength. It can also consume any metal, transforming it into its flesh and bones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Generally speaking, Magma Devourers reside on scorching stars. After all, the environment there is hotter. By devouring the magma on stars, they can gain power more quickly and become incredibly strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Magma Devourer likely came here to cultivate the Beast Soul Flower. After all, Beast Soul Flowers struggle to survive on stars. Now, you've picked most of the Beast Soul Flowers it planted. Its tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years of effort have been wasted, so it will come after you and fight desperately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, you managed to shake it off for now. However, the others participating in the zone duel with you are in trouble. As a Silicon-based Lifeform, this Magma Devourer is naturally not very intelligent. In such a furious state, it will definitely attack indiscriminately, killing every creature it encounters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> face was full of mockery. "I'm afraid many people will die here. Now, you can only hope that the Magma Devourer isn't too powerful and that the referees can handle it. Otherwise, the zone duel might as well end now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. "If the Magma Devourer can't find me, will it go after others?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Primordial nodded and said, "Never provoke a Silicon-based Lifeform lightly. Their intelligence is very low. If you provoke one, you'd better be able to take it down. Otherwise, it will keep coming after you until one of you dies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his chin, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Osborne said, "Let's go back and check things out. I've never seen a Silicon-based Lifeform. I want to see what this Magma Devourer looks like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was stunned. "Do you have a death wish? The Magma Devourer is at its angriest and most furious right now. If it sets its sights on you, it will definitely hunt you down next."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Don't worry. I just want to take a look at it from a distance. Besides, didn't you say its intelligence is low? It has great power but lacks matching intelligence. It won't pose much of a threat to me. If things go wrong, I'll run away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was determined to go back and take a look. Ignoring </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> objections, he took action immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "With Satan's Eye's help, taking a look from afar shouldn't be a problem. Besides, I already escaped from the Magma Devourer once before. Even if I'm spotted, I can definitely shake it off again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following the Magma Devourer's roars, he quickly approached it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire center of the volcanic region was shaking, and all the volcanoes were erupting wildly&mdash;this was caused by the Magma Devourer's fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From this, Osborne could tell that the Magma Devourer was absolutely powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed Satan's Eye to its limit and quickly saw it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne was stunned. The Magma Devourer was enormous, larger than a volcano, at least 30,000 feet tall. It resembled a giant turtle, with its body covered in a substance resembling boiling magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It roared and charged westward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Its</span><span> body is so massive. Beside it, I feel like an ant next to an elephant. There's an incredibly powerful energy fluctuation around it," Osborne said, somewhat shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial said, "Fortunately, it's just a juvenile Magma Devourer. Its strength is roughly equivalent to advanced Empyrean Sacredness. However, a Magma Devourer is, after all, a Silicon-based Lifeform. Any Silicon-based Lifeform possesses incredibly terrifying defense and power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although it's only equivalent to advanced Empyrean Sacredness, even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection would struggle to deal with it, let alone break its defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection would find it hard to kill it. Gerald is at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, right? They're in trouble this time."</span></p><div class="pagination">
