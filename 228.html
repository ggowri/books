  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the cold grip of death closing in, Orion suddenly found himself filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I'm a Class B+ metahuman, a rare spatial metahuman, and I still have plenty of tricks up my sleeve. Why does it have to end like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the spark of life faded from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Orion breathed his last, a rift tore open in the void before him. Osborne jumped back in alarm, momentarily convinced that Orion was staging a last-ditch effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He braced for an attack, but nothing came. Instead, the dimensional rift began spewing forth objects, the most striking of which was a massive iron chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes widening in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized that chest&mdash;it contained an ancient statue known as the Sacred Sorceress, which bore a striking resemblance to Clarissa. According to Orion, it was a level two ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly connected the dots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, being a spatial metahuman, could manipulate space and create an unseen Dimensional Space, like a pocket dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was dead, the Dimensional Space had lost its anchor and collapsed, releasing everything it contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the scattered items were a few changes of clothes, weapons, vital documents, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly piqued Osborne's interest was the statue of the Sacred Sorceress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't rush to inspect it. Instead, his gaze remained fixed on Orion's lifeless body, a glimmer of anticipation flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power is also one of the elemental powers. That means my Satan's Eye can totally devour his spatial elemental essence, allowing me to take control of spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power is often hailed as one of the top ten strongest powers. If I can harness it, my strength will skyrocket."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but recall the bizarre techniques Orion wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was dimensional rifts, Dimensional Space, Dimensional Collapse, or interdimensional travel, each had posed a significant challenge to him. If he could master those powers, just imagine how formidable he would become!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought fervently, "I have to absorb his spatial elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial power is incredibly rare; it might not appear again for centuries. I can't let this opportunity slip away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already consumed four types of elemental essences, and absorbing spatial elemental essence would make it five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the long lineage of the Augustine family, the most ambitious person had only managed to consume five types of elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragically, he had met his end during the fusion, his body exploding from the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that devouring a fifth elemental essence was not merely a gamble&mdash;it was a life-or-death risk. One misstep and it could all be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the spatial elemental essence was far too rare and potent to pass up. Missing this chance would haunt him forever. The power and abilities he would gain from it would elevate him to a level he couldn't imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just that; Osborne sensed that his Satan's Eye was different, somehow altered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the standard Satan's Eye passed down in the Augustine family possessed white star-like points in its depths, he was certain his own was marked by shimmering silver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a distinction that spoke of something more profound. Moreover, the typical Satan's Eye couldn't foresee danger, but his did. Each time he faced peril, his Satan's Eye would send him warnings, guiding him to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This precognitive ability was incredibly potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most seasoned fighters might develop a sense of danger after countless battles, but it would hardly compare to the clarity and sharpness that Osborne experienced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was the matter of perception. A normal Satan's Eye could see through most things, but it faced limitations&mdash;particularly when it came to powerful martial artists and metahumans, who generated a unique energy field that could obscure the Eye's vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Attempting to peer through their defenses would often alert them to the intrusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different; his Satan's Eye had none of those restrictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how formidable the adversary, whether a martial artist or a metahuman, he could see right through them. Just take Isa, for instance&mdash;she was undoubtedly a deadly martial artist, perhaps even a martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any ordinary Satan's Eye would fail against her, but Osborne could perceive her movements effortlessly without her ever being the wiser.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Osborne hadn't dared to think his power might stem from a mutation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, not long ago, he'd overheard Serena talking about a man named Vincent in the Augustine family. Vincent possessed a mutated Satan's Eye, making it far stronger than the ordinary version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Vincent's Eye could evolve, why couldn't his?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Osborne felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because my Satan's Eye is mutated that I was able to easily consume those four elemental essences, surpassing even Godfather. </span><span>So</span><span> what's to stop me from taking on a fifth? It won't necessarily spell doom for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination coursing through him, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his focus inward, delving into Orion's still-warm body. He could sense the lingering spatial elemental essence, just waiting to be claimed. With the help of his Satan's Eye, he swiftly began to extract and absorb the essence, feeling it slip away from Orion like shadows dispersing at dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne was hit by a tidal wave of spatial power, and the world around him shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if he had transcended the ordinary three dimensions, stepping into a realm of four.</span></p><div class="pagination">
