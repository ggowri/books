  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose poured every ounce of energy into his attacks, yet he still couldn't lay a finger on Hannah. Instead, he found himself nearly overwhelmed by her dark energy. Panic set in as he realized that if this continued, he would be publicly defeated by Hannah, who was technically beneath him in rank. That was something Ambrose simply couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperate, Ambrose called out to his teammates for backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though it was embarrassing to admit defeat, it was far better than being bested by Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His seven companions didn't hesitate for a moment; they launched their assaults in unison, joining forces with Ambrose to unleash a relentless barrage against Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them was a peak early Deity King, handpicked by Ambrose for their strength, and together, they applied pressure that Hannah could feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seriously? We agreed on a one-on-one fight, and now you're resorting to a gang-up? Ambrose, you really are pathetic! You're the so-called top talent of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A top ten Upper Race? That's laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to ambush Hannah, you'd better ask me first!" Zoe chimed in, her voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's face darkened, and he shot Zoe a murderous glare, wishing he could just sink into the ground and disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You seven, keep Hannah occupied! I'll deal with this woman myself!" he ordered, his voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's plan was straightforward. He couldn't let the embarrassment of failing to defeat Hannah linger; he had to do something to salvage his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The best way to regain his honor, in his mind, was to take down Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He figured Zoe looked younger than Hannah, so she couldn't possibly be that strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wild shout, he charged at Zoe. "You worthless Human Community woman, it's time for you to die! I, Ambrose, am not incapable of defeating Hannah. I'm just considering that she's from the Mystic Feather Clan, and they're one of the top ten Upper Races! You, on the other hand, don't deserve my respect, so prepare to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous roar, Ambrose swung the Supreme Malevolence Sword, unleashing a storm of lightning aimed directly at Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe's expression was one of pure scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose, you really know how to make excuses! You're just not strong enough and claiming you're sparing Hannah because of the Mystic Feather Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, you think you're worthy of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to regain your pride? Sorry, but you've picked the wrong opponent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Zoe locked eyes with Ambrose and subtly moved her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Ambrose was enveloped by a melodious sound that seemed to resonate directly in his mind, sweet as a song. In that instant, he froze, his furious and frantic expression turning blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Struggling to regain focus, he found himself lost in the captivating melody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose stood there, unable to grip the Supreme Malevolence Sword, which clattered to the ground without him even noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His soul sank into oblivion, his thoughts slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the enchanting sound continued to echo in his mind, his attacks lost all coherence, collapsing in mid-air and posing no threat to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose stood there, motionless, as if he had been turned to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beautiful sound played on repeat in his head, and he failed to notice that his Soul Current Ocean was in turmoil, churning like a raging sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, blood began to seep from his eyes, nose, and ears, and his breath became erratic. With a final, thunderous crash, he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe scoffed, her gaze sweeping over Ambrose with a mix of pity and disdain as she ceased her soul attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose's Soul Current Ocean was utterly destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Ambrose was a mid-stage Deity King, every member of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings surpassed him in soul power. For Zoe, dealing with Ambrose was far easier than it had been for Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his Soul Current Ocean in ruins, even if Ambrose regained consciousness, he would be nothing more than a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless the Thunderstorm Drake Clan was willing to pour a fortune of white Miracle Elixir into his recovery and then follow it up with a hefty dose of black Miracle Elixir to boost his soul power, his path of cultivation had effectively come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Ambrose lay defeated, the tide of battle shifted on the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Hannah might have found it challenging to take down Ambrose due to his higher rank and the power of the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, dealing with the other seven was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were no match for her dark power, which easily pierced through their defenses. Hannah's dark energy corroded their Divine Bodies, leaving them in a state of utter ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Ambrose's team was thoroughly defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers from various races erupted into a cacophony of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose is a mid-stage Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If even Ambrose fell, who could possibly defeat the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't accept this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
