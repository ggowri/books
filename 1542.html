  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey was taken aback by Osborne's words. He didn't fully understand what being made a Blood Clan descendant meant, but he knew instinctively that it couldn't possibly be good for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pleaded earnestly, "Please, you can't do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Every member is under the protection of the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself! If you harm me, he will sense it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go, and we can be friends!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're my friend, no one in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> will dare to bully you! The warriors of all clans will respect you; even those geniuses from the ten Upper Races will treat you with reverence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, please, don't hurt me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted in derision. "Spare me the melodrama! Not only do you want me to spare your life, but you also want to be my friend? Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get real! Just accept your fate and become my Blood Clan descendant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne acted decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A drop of brilliant red blood shot from his body, racing toward Tobey like a comet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming Tobey into a Blood Clan member was far more advantageous for Osborne than just killing him. The Paramount Supreme Clan held a prestigious position in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> and had the closest ties to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By transforming Tobey, Osborne would essentially place a spy within the Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;a direct line to information previously out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, through Tobey's membership in the Paramount Supreme Clan, Osborne could leverage his identity to purchase Ultimate divine artifacts exclusively available to members of that clan at the Artisan Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could also use this connection to swiftly advance within the Wild Flame Army, gaining control over it at an accelerated pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The benefits were too enticing to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the spatial energy confined Tobey, he felt utterly powerless. He could only watch in horror as the glowing drop of blood reached him and merged with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation began!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling scream tore itself from Tobey's throat as he felt an excruciating change deep at the genetic level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was torturous, and once completed, he would bear another identity altogether&mdash;Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan was also part of the Human Community, and transforming members of that community into Blood Clan descendants was something Osborne had done countless times before, flawlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how formidable Tobey was as a peak Celestial Deity, he was powerless against this transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's screams echoed through the air, mixed with his anger and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing to me, you lowly human?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop this at once! The esteemed Lord Malevolence won't let you get away with this! The Paramount Supreme Clan will avenge me! My father, my grandfather&mdash;they'll come for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to do this to me? You're as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one can save you; you're finished! I am Tobey, the noble of the Paramount Supreme Clan, a supreme genius of my people! I... </span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His roar became a howl of anguish, but no amount of defiance could halt the transformation process underway within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unfazed, a greedy smile on his face as he savored Tobey's suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scream all you want! Keep it up! Soon enough, you'll bow before me, calling me my Lord, obeying my every command! Enjoy your last moments of resistance before the transformation completes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's cries began to wane as the final stages approached, signaling that he was on the brink of becoming what Osborne desired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as it seemed the transformation would succeed, an unexpected twist unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tobey's body was on the verge of being completely transformed into that of a Blood Clan descendant, a terrifying surge of black energy erupted from the depths of his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dark force surged through Tobey's body, seemingly trying to protect him, to halt the transformation that was overtaking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it quickly became clear that this energy was powerless to stop what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation was too deep, too ingrained at the genetic level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid, the black energy coalesced before Tobey, forming a towering humanoid shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towering silhouette, though indistinct and faceless, exuded an aura of immense power and stature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt a bone-chilling dread wash over him, as if confronting a being from an elevated plane of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart began pounding uncontrollably, and his body tensed instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For reasons he couldn't quite grasp, the sight of this dark figure sparked a chilling thought in Osborne's mind: This is Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment that thought crossed his </span><span>mind,</span><span> Osborne's expression shifted to one of grave seriousness. In an instant, he unleashed all of his power, enveloping himself in a formidable shield of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, it didn't feel like enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Phantom Steps, slipping into a parallel dimension, his senses heightened and alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, to his shock, the black figure spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Lord Malevolence..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
