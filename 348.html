  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did they all commit suicide by taking poison?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you save some of them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. He didn't find it surprising that those individuals had ended their lives by poison. After all, the Class A- masters from Ghost Ship had all concealed poison in their teeth. Naturally, their subordinates would do the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was perplexed by Isa's inability to rescue some of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always claimed to be a top doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had anticipated her rescuing one or two individuals, hoping to extract more information about Ghost Ship from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help rolling her eyes. "How could I save them? I had no idea they had hidden poison in their teeth. I was completely caught off guard. They were already dead before I could even get them back to my room. I had no choice but to throw them all into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These bastards wasted my efforts. Next time we meet, I will be prepared and will not let them die easily. I will make them my experimental subjects and let them feel the fear," she said indignantly, but she did not ask Osborne to compensate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, are you sure you can stop them from committing suicide by taking poison next time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you looking down on me? I'm a top doctor. Despite the potency of the poison hidden in their teeth, I can effortlessly make an antidote! If I'm prepared, they won't be able to commit suicide in front of me. It's out of the question! As long as I intervene, they cannot end their lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Isa's shoulders and said with a grin, "Isa, make some antidotes quickly. They will be very useful to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed and slapped away his hand on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want the antidotes? Well, what can you offer in exchange?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "What about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly screamed, "Ouch!" Then, he lowered his head, covered his chest, and rubbed it hard, yet the pain persisted, causing him to break out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered at him. "Osborne, you are getting bolder and bolder. How dare you joke with me like this? Do you really think that I can't do anything just because your physical fitness has improved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled bitterly, "I was wrong. I am sorry. But now, you want neither money nor me. I don't know what I can give you in exchange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at him fiercely. "Are you still joking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his hands in surrender. "No! Don't you need experimental subjects? I'm dealing with Ghost Ship, which has numerous experts. Once their lair is found, I can surely capture plenty of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they all have poison hidden in their teeth, so catching them is futile. Give me the </span><span>antidotes, and I'll provide you with the experimental subjects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Isa was satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stroking her chin, she said, "I require certain herbs. Have someone deliver them to me and come back to get the antidotes in the evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne beamed and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, he asked, "Isa, you are so powerful. Can you track down that ancient ship? Following its trail is sure to uncover the hideout of Ghost Ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa retorted angrily, "Do you think I'm a god? I'm just a martial artist with no powers. How am I supposed to track it down in the vast ocean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa advised, "If you really intend to track down that ancient ship, you shouldn't come to me, but go find the little girl you brought back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't underestimate her as weak and inept. She's far stronger than you think. She's a metahuman, and her powers can help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pushed Osborne out and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the person Isa mentioned Kendra? Is she not just weak? Is she actually a metahuman? And can her powers help me track down that ancient ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no need for Isa to lie to him about this, so he went back to the fifteenth floor and found Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his eyes on her so intently that she felt her scalp tingle with bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong? Why are you staring at me like that? I am embarrassed," Kendra said with a red face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne withdrew his gaze, yet he still couldn't tell that she was a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Kendra, I have a difficult matter now and need your assistance. Can you help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra immediately replied excitedly, "Of course! Osborne, you are my savior. Tell me what you need me to do. As long as it's within my reach, I'll definitely help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "I need you to locate the ancient ship from yesterday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient ship? What ancient ship? I didn't see any ancient ships yesterday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused and touched his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he have overlooked this? The fog last night was so dense. Besides him, perhaps Isa was the only one who had noticed the ancient ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jacob and Layla hadn't seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had been staying on the Alisa Ship the whole time and couldn't catch sight of that ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she couldn't help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and prepared to leave and consider another solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Kendra asked, "Osborne, was the ancient ship you mentioned parked three miles to the east?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Osborne beamed with joy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
