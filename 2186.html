  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Celestara Planet drew nearer, a sudden sense of unease washed over Osborne like a cold, relentless tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if an invisible vice had clamped down on his chest, constricting his breathing and sending his heart into a wild, erratic gallop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, his brow knitting into a tight frown, "What on earth is happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why am I suddenly feeling so... off? Could something be amiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to pinpoint the source of his discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth in frustration, he bellowed, "Ascending Sacred Sanctum, full speed ahead! We need to reach Celestara Planet&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battered vessel let out a low, resonant hum, its hull trembling slightly as it heeded his command. In the blink of an eye, it shot forward like a phantom wraith, slicing through the inky expanse of deep space with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a soft, almost ethereal sound, like a single drop of water merging with the vast ocean, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum pierced through the fabric of space and emerged into a world ablaze with color and life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart skipped a beat as he drank in the familiar sights and sounds around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt in his mind&mdash;he was back on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as a wave of relief washed over him, Osborne's features contorted into a mask of utter disbelief. A cold, stark realization sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the Blood Demons... dead?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire Hudson family... five million souls... wiped out?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the God of Light... gone?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his time adrift in the vast expanse of deep space, the sheer distance had shielded him from the tragic fates that had befallen his creations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Blood Demons being his Blood Golems, he had remained oblivious to their passing until this very moment. The Blood Demons had met their end in the crucible of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family, every single one of its five-million-strong members, had been snuffed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once replicated their life essences, and through that connection, he could now feel the void where their vitality had once thrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The life essence of the God of Light, the most complex and powerful, used to be dim as she was alive. But now, it was faintly glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated the God of Light had perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant Osborne could use the superpower of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to activate her life essence and resurrect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems the Paramount Supreme Clan has launched a full-scale war against the Human Community, and it's more intense than I ever imagined. Otherwise, the Blood Demon wouldn't have perished, nor would the Hudson family have been wiped out. </span><span>Most alarmingly, even the God of Light is gone. Did Lord Malevolence take the field himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no way of knowing for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the timing of their deaths wasn't long ago, suggesting that the war had only just begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reviving the God of Light will give me answers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided against reviving the Blood Demon or the Hudson family members just yet. Their cultivation levels were too low to make a significant impact in this war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he focused on bringing back the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute guardianship! Revive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he activated her life essence, a graceful figure materialized before him, quickly taking shape as flesh and form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was completely naked. While Osborne could restore her body, he couldn't conjure her clothes back into existence. The newly revived God of Light stood there, bare and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit awkward, he quickly rummaged through his Dimensional Space and tossed her a dress, turning his back to give her some privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the God of Light fully revived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flickered with confusion for a brief moment before clarity returned. She recognized Osborne and felt a rush of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Osborne's resurrection ability, and his foresight in copying her life essence, the God of Light would have been lost forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be alive... what a blessing," she murmured softly, only then becoming conscious of her nudity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blush spread across her cheeks like a warm, rosy tide when she noticed a dress floating nearby. Realizing it was from Osborne, she quickly snatched it up and slipped it on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the heat of embarrassment rising within her, she took a deep breath and composed herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing her throat, she said, "Osborne, you're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiveled to face her, offering a curt nod. There were no pleasantries; his focus was razor-sharp. "God of Light, what on earth transpired? How did you end up dead? And what's the state of the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light wasted no time in filling him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell you what happened right before my demise. But what took place after that, I'm completely in the dark. Osborne, we have to return to the West Zone immediately. After my death, the morale of the Human Alliance must have crumbled to dust. I'm deeply worried about what lies ahead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was clouded with worry, and this only made Osborne's expression even graver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew in his bones that the Human Community was probably facing its most critical and dangerous hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to say something, a sudden, colossal wave of energy surged through the air, blanketing a vast expanse of Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the God of Light exchanged startled looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such an overpowering energy signature!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's emanating from the West Zone! Two incredibly powerful warriors are going head-to-head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who could be engaged in this battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The energy has a sinister feel to it! Two sources of dark energy are clashing&mdash;one is incredibly dominant, while the other is slightly less so! Could the stronger one be Lord Malevolence? And the other... Could it be the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the strength of those two dark energies. They were astonishingly powerful, eclipsing even the God of Light and Atticus' projection. Whoever was in that fight had to be among the elite among Ascension Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possibly even Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another second, Osborne declared, "God of Light, we need to get back to the West Zone right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp whoosh, the ship's propulsion runes erupted in radiant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite about seventy percent of the propulsion runes being damaged, the remaining thirty percent propelled the Ascending Sacred Sanctum forward at an astonishing speed, barreling toward the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was so exhilarating that it left the God of Light in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, her Sanctum of Light felt like a snail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the seemingly battered vessel zip by, God of Light fell into a contemplative silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had other priorities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye, gazing toward the West Zone. The power of the Sacredness Level ability was staggering. Even from a great distance, he could begin to see fragments of the intense battle unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, he laid eyes on the two super-strong fighters clashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw froze him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Lord Malevolence and God of Night as he had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, it was Lord Malevolence and Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank in terror when, just as he recognized Isa, he witnessed Lord Malevolence send her flying with a devastating blow before crashing to the ground, gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the very next moment, Lord Malevolence's hand was around Isa's throat, squeezing tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt as if the air had been knocked out of him, his heart racing in terror at the sight before him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
