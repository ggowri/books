  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent crashed hard onto the arena floor, not unconscious but wishing he were.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sting of Clarissa's icy words cut deeper than any physical blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't even come close to being as good as a single hair on Osborne's head!" Clarissa had said, and that was a humiliation he couldn't shake off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anger surged through him, and Vincent spat out another mouthful of blood, fury boiling over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd, witnessing his defeat at the hands of Clarissa, turned their scornful gazes upon him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all he's got? And he had the nerve to challenge her?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Getting taken down in one hit? Talk about embarrassing!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! I heard he was once considered the strongest among the young of the Augustine family. Now look at him&mdash;he's a joke!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just goes to show how far the Augustine family has fallen!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each mocking comment felt like a dagger to Vincent's pride, and with a final, defeated gasp, he slumped over, unconscious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen and Matthew rushed forward, quickly lifting him up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces were drawn tight with concern and embarrassment. The laughter directed at Vincent was a reflection of their own failures, and they felt powerless to defend him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, their strength paled in comparison to even Vincent's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look at this ridiculous Augustine family! Their younger generation is a bunch of losers, and they think they can hold an Honor Quest Ceremony? This is going to be a total disgrace!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who among the young ones dares to challenge me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A brash young man jumped onto the arena, eager to take advantage of the situation. Matthew and Owen clenched their fists, their expressions darkening.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenger taunted, his voice dripping with derision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it true? Is the younger generation of the Augustine family so weak that no one is willing to step up? Where are you all hiding?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic Augustine family!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, I can't take this!" Matthew growled, stepping forward, ready to defend their honor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cool voice interjected, "Let me handle this."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, a striking figure, swiftly made her way onto the arena, capturing everyone's attention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd's eyes lit up at the sight of Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While she might not have possessed the ethereal beauty of Clarissa, she was undeniably stunning in her own right, and her presence commanded respect.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Matthew felt a wave of relief wash over him as Emma took the stage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa, now stepping down from the arena, watched Emma with a hint of surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's broken through to Class AAA!" Clarissa murmured, a sense of pressure building within her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma caught Clarissa's gaze and smiled, offering a nod.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa furrowed her brow, sensing a shift in Emma's demeanor but unable to pinpoint why.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could only watch as the confrontation unfolded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma focused on the challenger, her voice icy. "So you're the one who said the younger generation of the Augustine family is finished? You think we're all worthless?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man said, "Absolutely! What's it to you? Not one of you has even made it onto the Godson Rankings. You're all just a bunch of nobodies! If you don&rsquo;t like it, come and beat me!&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine! Come at me!" Emma taunted, eager for the fight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a fierce resolve, Emma launched her attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Psychic Blast!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A powerful wave of psychic energy surged across the arena, slicing through the air and crashing into the challenger's mind with a deafening hum.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a man's scream pierced the air as blood streamed from his mouth, nose, and even his ears, before he collapsed in agony on the arena floor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was defeated just like that, with a single move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had taken him down effortlessly with a psychic attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps echoed from the crowd as they stared in disbelief at her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's expression was fierce as she glared at the onlookers, her voice cold and commanding. "Is there anyone else who thinks the younger generation of the Augustine family is weak? Step up and fight me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm Emma Augustine, and I'll take all challengers!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words sent the crowd into a frenzy, excitement electrifying the atmosphere.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Matthew, Owen, and the other members of the Augustine family felt a surge of pride.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had redeemed Vincent's lost honor!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another man shouted, rushing onto the stage, "I'm here to challenge you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His aura was powerful, marking him as a Class AAA fighter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he lacked the mastery of Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, having gone toe-to-toe with Cuthbert and even pushed him to his limits, found this ordinary Class AAA challenger to be no real threat at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle that followed was swift and decisive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cast "Freeze" or "Psychic Blast".</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not a single opponent could withstand her Freeze or Psychic Blast for even a round.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One after another, Emma defeated challenger after challenger, each time with a single blow, leaving the audience in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone suddenly shouted, "I know who she is now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's Maia, ranked 299th on the Godson Rankings! She's the one who gave Cuthbert a run for his money during his Honor Quest Ceremony!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maia is just her alias!"</p><div class="pagination">
