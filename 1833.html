  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the heart of the Hudson family territory, there's just this ordinary old man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake off the oddity of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Hudson family's immense power&mdash;over a thousand peak Deity Kings and a multitude of young prodigies&mdash;what on earth was a plain elder doing in such a central area?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man didn't even seem to have ascended to divinity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no Divine Flame flickering above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't as if he was using some kind of technique like the Eclipsing Mantra to hide his Divine Flame; he genuinely lacked one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with his Level Ten Satan's Eye, he would have seen through any facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No Divine Flame? Not even a Junior Deity? What's an unascended old man doing in the core of the Hudson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his initial sweep of the Hudson family, he had focused solely on those warriors crowned with seven vibrant Divine Flames, naturally overlooking this flame-less figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this old man seemed to be the most peculiar of all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite his keen observation, Osborne couldn't pinpoint what was strange. His Satan's Eye, honed to Level Ten, could penetrate any disguise, reveal any level, and even discern elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on this elder, he found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the man were devoid of elemental power, an ordinary human without divinity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, something's definitely not right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew more serious as he pushed his Satan's Eye to its limits, locking his gaze on the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the old man began to transform before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's vision, the elder was engulfed in a massive inferno, a terrifying blaze that swallowed everything around him, radiating an aura of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "This is... Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body has merged with Divine Flame?!" Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames surrounding the elder were unmistakably Divine Flame, but instead of hovering above him, they were fused with his very being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, hovering above the elder's head, Osborne saw something else&mdash;a staircase!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal, translucent staircase, shimmering, appeared behind the old man. Though it had only two steps, it seemed to stretch through space and time, extending into an unknown and mysterious realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of that staircase sent chills down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some inexplicable reason, as he gazed at it, a voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The so-called Supernal Deity King is one who, after reaching the peak of Deity King, can take a further step to completely merge their Divine Flame with their Divine Body, undergoing a profound transformation to become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To step onto the Ascension Stairway and survive is to become a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you step onto the Ascension Stairway and die... You vanish without a trace, with no chance of reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, finally grasping the essence of a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is the Supernal Deity King! The Ascension Stairway... What does it all mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be Jethro, the head of the Hudson family. The two steps above his head indicate his level&mdash;he's an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King! An Ascension Two Supernal Deity King..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, trying to suppress the shock that coursed through him as he continued to scrutinize Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Jethro suddenly furrowed his brow, a look of concentration washing over his face as he slowly lifted his head, seemingly sensing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to spy on me? You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's voice rang out, echoing in Osborne's mind, sending a jolt through his body and causing the very fabric of his Soul Current Ocean to ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was staring directly at his hidden position, his gaze filled with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Discovered?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. He was positioned far outside the Hudson Valley, separated by a great distance and surrounded by a divine power shield, existing in a parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, Jethro had still sensed him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the instant he disappeared, an aged figure appeared nearby&mdash;it was Jethro!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression was icy as he hovered in the void, sensing the faint spatial fluctuations around him, his face a mix of astonishment and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power? Someone just used spatial power here? He was hiding in the shadows, watching me? How did he manage that? Who could it be, and why would he do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression darkened, frustration etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone capable of spying on me from this position would have to be at least an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King. The only ones who could pull off something like this would be at the level of the esteemed God of Light... Could it be that the esteemed God of Space has returned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As that thought crossed his mind, excitement flickered in Jethro's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must report this to the esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
