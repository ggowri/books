  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, the ideal scenario in the looming conflict between the Deschanel family and the League of Divine Descent was mutual destruction. He hoped they would both </span><span>weaken each other enough to drag out the war, buying him valuable time to strengthen his own forces and prepare for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether the Deschanel family swiftly eliminated the League or vice versa, neither outcome boded well for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon Vanguard members still needed three days to ascend to their divine forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel family wiped out the League with little effort, they would surely turn their sights on the Augustine family next. Given their current strength, the Augustine family was ill-prepared to contend with the divine warriors of the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conversely, if the League managed to dispatch the Deschanel family's gods, their warriors would likely charge toward </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to root out the remaining Deschanel family members, endangering the Augustine family with the same swiftness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, regardless of who won, it spelled trouble for Osborne. He had to prevent a one-sided slaughter from unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "If things shake out that way, I might just have to step in. The Augustine family can't afford to see the Deschanel family take out the League, and on the other hand, I can't let the League wipe out the Deschanel family in one fell swoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ideally, I want both sides to take significant hits but not entirely collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happens, I'll have access to a wealth of blood energy again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a few Intermediate Deities go down, that would be a huge win! One Intermediate Deity's blood energy is staggeringly vast&mdash;enough to help dozens of Blood Demon members forge Divine Bodies and transcend to becoming godly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a good opportunity comes along, I wouldn't hesitate to take out a few Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weaken them while bolstering the Blood Demons&mdash;it's a classic case of mutual benefit. Before long, the Deschanel family would be a minor concern."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered these strategies, Osborne approached the outskirts of Marcelin's capital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thornberry family resided in a geological park just outside the city, a vast expanse split in half&mdash;one side belonging to them, the other open to the public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a popular tourist destination, the park had suffered due to the rampant surge of energy in the environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it resembled a primeval jungle overtaken by wildlife, scaring off any would-be visitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Thornberry family remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden in the parallel space, Osborne discreetly observed the Thornberry family nestled within the dense vegetation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are the Deschanel family gods? And why do the Thornberry folks seem so composed? It's puzzling. The Deschanel family has obliterated twenty-four out of thirty-six Divine Families in the League with brutal efficiency!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thornberry family must've heard the news; they can't be unaware that the Deschanel family is likely gearing up for an assault on them. So why the calm demeanor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are they either foolish or just overly confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was bemused. The Thornberry family members were going about their business, training, and daily routines as if they weren't facing imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's suspicious. Maybe this is intentional?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they're trying to intimidate the Deschanel family gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel family sees the Thornberry family acting unfazed, will they think the Thornberry family isn't scared? That they have some sort of upper hand? Maybe they won't dare to attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stroked his chin thoughtfully but shook his head, deciding not to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No sense in overthinking. I'll just have to wait and see how this unfolds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the gods of the Deschanel family still </span><span>en</span><span> route, Osborne knew he couldn't afford to sit idle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dove into studying the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipsing Mantra, passed down to him by Mila, comprised five levels. Although the complete teachings resided in his mind, he could currently only access the first level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mastering this initial level was a prerequisite for unveiling the next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The first level of Eclipsing Mantra allows me to mask my aura and conceal the Divine Flame above my head. That means even those significantly stronger than me won't sense my true strength or know my level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's quite useful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I may just be a Junior Deity, but I can easily take on an Intermediate Deity and even stand my ground in a fight against a Superior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding my Divine Flame is crucial, especially since mine is colorless and transparent&mdash;it's way too conspicuous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much I try to disguise myself, as soon as someone catches a glimpse of my Divine Flame, they'll immediately know it's me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to master the first level of Eclipsing Mantra and keep that Divine Flame under wraps. It's the perfect setup for striking from the shadows and stirring up chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dedicated himself to grasping the Eclipsing Mantra with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he feared that it would be a tough endeavor; after all, Mila had mentioned that even her parents only managed to master four levels, while she only mastered three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Divine Shadow, she had just scraped by with the first level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's astonishment, as he began to immerse himself in the mantra, he found the process unexpectedly smooth; it was almost effortless. It felt as natural as eating or drinking, flowing seamlessly into his consciousness.</span></p><div class="pagination">
