  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in the Central Zone, a staggering distance of several billion miles from the Hudson family in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after reaching the late Level Nine of space elemental essence, his interdimensional travel distance had skyrocketed from 60 million miles to an impressive 300 million miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of jumps, he finally returned to the West Zone, standing just outside Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gazed at the tranquil Hudson Valley, a smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had only been away from the Hudson family for a little over three months, it felt like an eternity to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his departure, he was merely at the mid Deity King Level, trapped by Trevor, an Ascension One Supernal Deity King from the Baxter family, using the Universe-Sealing Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been completely helpless, waiting for the Hudson family to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, Osborne was confident he could easily take down Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Trevor dared to provoke him again, it would be a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite still being at the highest Deity King Level, Osborne's strength far exceeded that level. He felt capable of taking on even Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, and he wasn't afraid of Ascension Three either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came to a fight, he wouldn't be far off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the moment he left deep space, Osborne sensed the opportunity to break through to Supernal Deity King. But he had heeded Primordial's advice to take some time to stabilize before making that leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally did break through, he would be even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, these past three months had been incredibly rewarding for Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the boost in strength, he had amassed over a million Miracle Elixirs and more than 10 billion Celestial Crystals, stacked high like hills, in Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of these treasures came from his dealings with Creation Herald, while a smaller portion was gathered during his own explorations of divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a fortune beyond imagination!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, Osborne had acquired several super divine artifacts, including the Rainbow Armor and Dominion Battle Suit, along with various weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simply put, Osborne was now extremely wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least among the Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community in the West Zone, none could compare to him. Even the Sanctum of Light probably didn't match his wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, I'll need to stabilize for a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped into Hudson Valley, the members of the Hudson family immediately sensed his return and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne greeted them with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good to see you, kid! You're back safe and sound!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you seem stronger! Wait, is that the highest Deity King Level I see? In just over three months, you went from mid Deity King Level to the peak? Did you hit some kind of jackpot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're already at the highest Deity King Level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're catching up to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His uncles and aunts surrounded him, buzzing with excitement, firing questions about where he had been and what he had experienced over the past three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared what he could, and their gasps of astonishment filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro finally interjected, "Alright, enough crowding around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's reached your level. Shouldn't you all step up your game? It's high time you broke through to Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all know the Paramount Supreme Clan is mobilizing troops toward the West Zone border. The Dark Deity Legion is growing in number every day on the battlefield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a feeling a full-scale war is just around the corner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can only truly help the Human Community by becoming Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression turned serious, and the faces of Zachary, Alicia, and the others grew solemn in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, we want to break through to Supernal Deity King, too, but it's not that simple. Our talents might have hit a wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To reach Supernal Deity King, you either need time or a boatload of Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we've got neither!" Zachary sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't argue. He knew this was a real issue. Although Osborne had left them plenty of Celestial Crystals, they weren't very effective for breaking through to the Supernal Deity King. To make that leap, they needed a significant boost in potential from Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, they would have to grind it out over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, with a full-scale war likely on the horizon, they didn't have the luxury of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mood among the Hudson family members grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time? Miracle Elixirs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, he had both!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his time power, he could accelerate the training of everyone in the Hudson family, giving them more than 100 times their usual cultivation time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that stash of over a million Miracle Elixirs? That was more than enough for the Hudson family to go on a spending spree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne spoke up, "Grandpa, I have a way for uncles and aunts to break through to Supernal Deity King quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro turned to him, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary and the others looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro frowned and said, "Osborne, don't go throwing around wild ideas! What could you possibly have in mind to help them break through to Supernal Deity King? It's an incredibly tough feat for anyone! The talent required is sky-high. Otherwise, we wouldn't be stuck at just twenty Dukedom Level Powers in the West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're barely scraping by as it is. If they had enough time, they might have a shot at becoming Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it would take hundreds, if not thousands, of Miracle Elixirs to make it happen! And that's just not feasible for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we had all the Celestial Crystals in the world, we couldn't buy that many Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a heavy sigh, Jethro's expression mirrored the growing gloom in Zachary's and the others' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they quickly shook it off, forcing smiles to reassure Osborne. "Don't worry about us, Osborne! We'll put in the effort! Just your concern is enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! You don't have to carry that weight! Breaking through to Supernal Deity King is on us. If we can't do it, it's our own fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at their earnestness, "Grandpa! I really do have a solution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his Dimensional Bag and handed it directly to Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing another Dimensional Bag, Jethro froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this more Celestial Crystals? Osborne, the last batch you gave us was more than enough to last us a long time. We don't need any more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro started to return the Dimensional Bag to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne simply opened the bag and declared, "Grandpa! This time it's not Celestial Crystals. It's Miracle Elixirs! A full 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs! That should be enough for all the uncles and aunts to break through to Supernal Deity King, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the air around them fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, Zachary, and the others stared at Osborne, wide-eyed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices trembled as they asked, "Did you just say 10 thousand Miracle Elixirs?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
