  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of Silent Valley, behind a small hill, Apollo was waiting for good news from his Kill Team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the Viper Squad, the six members of Kill Team weren't the strongest. Except for their leader, a Class C plus metahuman, the other five were just Class C martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Apollo had full confidence in Kill Team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fought countless battles abroad, and Kill Team had earned numerous accolades without ever failing. Their enemies called them ghosts because they possessed the extra energy to become invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even large reconnaissance equipment couldn't detect them when they were invisible. Only when they got close enough, through sounds like footsteps, could the enemies spot them. But by then, it was already too late for the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone gets ready. Once Kill Team takes out Skyefall Security's scouts, it's our turn. Our goal isn't just to win this contest but to wipe them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially Valentin. I'm going to snap his neck myself," Apollo sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a muffled sniper gunshot rang out. Apollo's face changed as he instantly recognized the sound wasn't from their sniper gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Who got exposed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Skyefall Security shoot first? Did Kill Team move too early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't worried at first, thinking it was just Kill Team taking out enemies close by and the enemies retaliating in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sniper gunshots kept coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his earpiece remained silent, with no reports from Kill Team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill Team, respond, what's the situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill Team..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo started calling out to Kill Team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his repeated calls went unanswered because all six members of Kill Team had already been blown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's face turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo clenched his fists, his killing intent boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kill Team was his ace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those metahumans with invisibility skills had earned him many victories. Their deaths made him almost breathless with grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew now wasn't the time to mourn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Skyefall Security, how did they find Kill Team? You killed my men, and I'll grind your bones to dust."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo growled, thinking about what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, another gunshot suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo felt an intense sense of danger, a feeling honed from countless battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he rolled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a young man behind Apollo was blasted away. The large caliber bullet exploded his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red and white splattered on Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes contracted sharply, fear taking over. If he hadn't dodged quickly, he would have been the one hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo roared and immediately took cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members of Viper Squad quickly began to resist. One formed a thick wall in front of them, while another created a large transparent shield around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shield was made of flowing water if one took a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From two kilometers away, Osborne reluctantly put down his sniper gun. "Too bad, just a hair's breadth away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed and said, "I told you, Class B metahumans aren't that easy to kill. Even if you had hit him, he wouldn't have died. Believe me? Now you've startled him, it'll be even harder to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne handed the sniper gun back to Valentin but didn't feel defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was just a try anyway. At least I took out one of his guys. And you mean Apollo can withstand a Class B sniper gun attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class B metahumans, compared to Class C plus, the biggest difference isn't their combat power, but that Class Bs have the soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The soul of powers will erupt all their strength at once when they're under a lethal attack. And it can block any attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, sneaking up on a Class B metahuman is nearly impossible. Unless you're way stronger than him and can shatter his soul of powers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked surprised. "Soul of powers?" He had never faced a Class B metahuman before and didn't know this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Isa resentfully. "Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shrugged. "Why should I? If you really could snipe him and trigger his soul of powers, it would still drain his strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Osborne didn't dwell on it, saying, "No worries, I'll shatter his soul of powers myself later. I'm eager to see how strong a Class B metahuman really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before that, I need to absorb more elemental essence to boost my strength and make sure nothing goes wrong."</span></p><div class="pagination">
