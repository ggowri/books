  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you got this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma whispered, "You have to beat this jerk and avenge me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded and continued walking toward the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian looked at him with concern. "Axell, be careful! If things go south, just step off the stage and admit defeat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded again, his expression unchanged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, stay safe!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Aleena's voice echoed. She knew Osborne and Cuthbert were bound to clash, and she couldn't resist coming to watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned and nodded with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. I'll defeat him and avenge Rhett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne stepped onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Osborne's words, Cuthbert couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Defeat me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's face was full of disdain. "You, a piece of trash from the Lambert family? Rhett is severely injured, thanks to me. Even if he recovers, he'll never be at his peak again. No more breakthroughs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And your sister, what's her name? Maia, right? Haha, I broke more than ten of her bones and made her cough up blood. Bet that hurt, didn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your entire Lambert family, a bunch of weaklings, dares to challenge me? You think you can avenge them? Haha, not to belittle you, but do you even think you're worthy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert mocked loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't attack right away. He partly to buy time and recover some strength, and partly to further humiliate Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression remained cold and calm. "Are you done talking? If so, then attack. I told you, I'm going to defeat you. Your&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony&nbsp;ends here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're courting death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I defeat you, that'll be my fiftieth consecutive win, a milestone! Fifty straight wins may not be much, but to teach you a painful lesson during that milestone is worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're so eager to die, I'll grant your wish!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Cuthbert suddenly attacked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't use his&nbsp;Strength Realm. After all, using the realm consumed a lot of mental strength, and he didn't think Osborne was worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take this punch first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert threw a powerful punch straight at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In previous fights, his opponents would immediately activate their realms to defend, never daring to face him head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Cuthbert miscalculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was unlike any of the challengers he had faced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing Cuthbert's punch and sensing the immense power behind it, Osborne didn't activate his realm. Instead, he took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Breath of Celestial!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air on the stage was instantly sucked dry, and Osborne felt his strength skyrocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Breath of Celestial, Level Four!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With one breath, Osborne's power increased by 80%. He met Cuthbert's punch head-on, throwing his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, their fists collided with an explosion-like sound, sending terrifying shockwaves in all directions, making the spectators' scalps tingle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud, thud, thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a horrifying force surge into his body. His face paled, and he was forced back five steps before finally stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Cuthbert only wobbled for a moment before regaining his balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this situation left Cuthbert stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Osborne in disbelief. Osborne had actually blocked his punch head-on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without using his realm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pure power alone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert muttered, though he wasn't at his peak and hadn't activated his&nbsp;Strength Realm. How could Osborne possibly block a punch at full strength?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body had fused with an ancient artifact from a young age, giving him natural strength. At his level, no one had ever come close to matching his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet Osborne was only Class AA!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's level was an entire grade lower, and yet he could go toe-to-toe with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne were also Class AAA, wouldn't his strength surpass Cuthbert's?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given the situation, how could Cuthbert not be shocked?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The audience below the stage was equally stunned, staring at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had already defeated forty-nine opponents in a row, all of them strong Class AAA fighters, yet none had managed to withstand a head-on clash with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Osborne, a mere Class AA, had done it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite being pushed back, Osborne had undeniably held his ground in a direct confrontation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his slightly sore arm and gave a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, you don't seem as strong as you look. Is this the best you've got? If so, your&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony&nbsp;is about to end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll personally put an end to your winning streak."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne finished speaking, Cuthbert's face turned cold. The murderous intent filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead!"</p><div class="pagination">
