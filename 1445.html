  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake his anxiety; after all, Walter was a Deity Overlord warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Celestara, being a Deity Overlord placed one at the pinnacle of power. It was rare for even Deity Kings to make an appearance, so a Deity Overlord stood as the highest warrior in most situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the few he had met&mdash;people like Terrence from the Deschanel Clan, Nelson, Emperor Dare, Apocalypse Harbinger, and Divine Shadow&mdash;while they had once held the title of Deity Overlord, their current strength was more akin to that of Transcendent Deities. They didn't truly embody the might of a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt unsteady regarding the true power of a Deity Overlord and the range of their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident in the strength of the Eclipsing Mantra, which masked his aura perfectly, but whether it could fool someone as formidable as Walter remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If Walter sees through me, I'll have to make a run for it! My space elemental essence is already at Level Six peak. No typical Deity Overlord should possess a Level Six peak elemental essence. Even if Walter is a Deity Overlord, if I really want to escape, he shouldn't be able to stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly reviewed how Lachlan had presented himself in front of Walter in the past. Satisfied that his cover was solid, he followed Belinda into the residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's abode was nothing short of massive, resembling a grand palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, many buildings were colossal, owing to the fact that several races had naturally large forms. Though they often manifested in humanoid shapes, they reverted to their true forms when relaxing at home, necessitating the need for spacious architecture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's dwelling was particularly expansive, as he occasionally hosted warriors from other races, requiring ample space to make these guests comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Osborne, it felt as if he had stepped into a palace, an ant in a vast world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand living room was already filled with guests, their conversations echoing in the expansive space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the head of the room sat Walter, the reigning patriarch of the Swift family and a Deity Overlord warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one glance at him made Osborne tense up; Walter didn't deliberately radiate an aura of divine power, yet his presence commanded an immense sense of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Walter's sharp gaze swept over the room, Osborne felt as though he were laid bare, his every secret exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his relief, it was merely an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Lachlan and Belinda's arrival, a smile broke across Walter's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Belinda, Lachlan, you're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he hadn't noticed the change in Lachlan&mdash;a fact that eased some of the tension in Osborne's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stepped forward with Belinda to pay their respects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bowing to Walter, Osborne surveyed the other gathered guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most were familiar faces to him&mdash;Lachlan's uncles, elder relatives, and exceptional peers, the very core of the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a few unfamiliar faces caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This group consisted of strikingly handsome men and beautiful women, each adorned with a colorful emblem on their foreheads, resembling the feathers of a phoenix, creating a harmonious and stunning visual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan!" Osborne thought, a wave of surprise washing over him as he recognized them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell upon the badges on their chests, and his astonishment deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're from the Gellar family within the Mystic Feather Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the ten upper races, Mystic Feather Clan was home to many powerful families, and the Gellar family was among the most influential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the Gellar family ranked among the top three within the Mystic Feather Clan, and even within the entire Wild Flame City, they held a top-ten position in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the esteemed lady from the Mystic Feather Clan who Belinda mentioned as a potential match for me is actually a member of the Gellar family? That seems unlikely. Even if Walter is a Deity Overlord, there's no way he could arrange a marriage between 'Lachlan' and the Gellar family," Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he noticed the Gellar family members sizing him up, he offered them a polite nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Walter spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Friends from the Gellar family, allow me to introduce my grandson, Lachlan! Though he lost his parents at a young age, he's proven himself to be quite remarkable. He's one of my finest grandchildren&mdash;not only is he handsome and spirited, but he also has decent talent. Currently, he's a Transcendent Deity with a Level Four Divine Body, serving as a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter beamed with pride, his smile broadening. "So, what do you all think? Are you satisfied?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged woman leading the Gellar family frowned at Walter's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army? That position is rather lowly. However, if he were to marry into the Gellar family, we could certainly help him advance. As long as his strength keeps up, we could make him a chiliarch in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, his talent is quite average. A Transcendent Deity with a Level Four Divine Body doesn't quite measure up to our Ms. Hannah Gellar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Walter, your grandson doesn't hold any advantages compared to competitors from other factions."</span></p><div class="pagination">
