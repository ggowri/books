  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High above Wild Flame City, on the floating mountain to the east, an ethereal courtyard unfolded like a scene from a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beautiful young woman in vibrant garments sat before a chessboard, her eyes sparkling with intelligence. Across from her was a wise old man with flowing white hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's brow furrowed slightly, disappointment flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He went to the slave market? If that's the case, I don't want anything to do with him anymore, Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man smiled faintly at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, are you sure about this? Maybe you should ask what he's doing at the slave market first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow. "What else could he be doing? He went to the slave market to buy slaves, of course! As a member of the Human Community, he not only accepts the trade of human slaves but actively participates! Instead of trying to change the system, he's choosing to become a customer&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment colored her tone as she shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without demand, there's no harm. It's a simple principle, yet he fails to understand it! Honestly, I'm very disappointed! Grandpa, I want to go to the West Zone&hellip;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked up earnestly at the old man. "Perhaps the West Zone is the only place where I can find a true man with courage and determination among the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"West Zone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's expression turned grave as he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely not! The West Zone is the territory of the Human Community's resistance organization. They're sworn enemies of all clans. They won't treat you any differently just because you belong to the Mystic Feather Clan. It's far too dangerous for you to go there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah furrowed her brows. "But I told you, it might be the only place where I can find real man with courage and determination! You know my situation, Grandpa, and if my husband ends up being someone like Lachlan, I'd rather die than marry him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man frowned deeply at her declaration. "Hannah, I will not allow you to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Gellar family will never permit it! Besides, Lachlan might not be as hopeless as you think. His visit to the slave market is actually to cancel the slave registrations for the ten or so slaves he purchased before, allowing them to regain their freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sense something has changed in him. But what that change is, I can't quite put my finger on it. You'll need to meet with him again to see if he's just putting on a front or if he has truly transformed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes widened in surprise. "He went to the slave market to free his slaves? Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, suddenly, his expression shifted. "I just received new information. It seems Lachlan has indeed changed! He just caused quite a ruckus at the slave market, confronting the manager and physically fighting with a salesman and security personnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of those guards were even Transcendent Deity warriors, yet they couldn't hold a candle to him! His strength is exceeding my expectations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was taken aback. "He fought at the slave market?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he out of his mind? That's the territory of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan! Even we from the Mystic Feather Clan wouldn't stir up trouble there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her brows knitted in concern, she added, "Grandpa, you have to help him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man shook his head. "No need for me to rush in and save him. It seems he has his own ways of handling things. We can just sit back and watch the show."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Hannah asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man quickly filled her in on the details, and Hannah's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's attending a slave auction? So, if he spends 10 million Essence Crystals, he'll become a VIP at the slave market, and he won't run into any trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of excitement sparked in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you keep playing your game. I feel a sudden urge to find out exactly what kind of person he is! I'm heading out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah took to the skies, soaring away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided not to stop her. "Hannah, just be careful! After all, that's the territory of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be fine, Grandpa," she called back, already disappearing from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had been brought into a vast auction hall by Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was completely unaware that just moments ago, the Swift family, fearing they might get dragged down with him, had hastily announced his expulsion from the family, cutting all ties with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also had no idea that Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan, intrigued by his actions, was eager to make contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sat quietly in the auction hall, waiting patiently for the event to commence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a premier slave auction, and Osborne had never attended anything like it before&mdash;he had no idea what to expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made up his mind, thinking, "As soon as they put up any human slaves for auction, I'll do my best to buy them. I may not have the power to dismantle the slave market yet, but if I can save even one, that's something!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
