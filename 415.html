  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa once said that the body of an elemental metahuman was as fragile as broken glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement was equally applicable even to a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's fist, the water elemental power master's body was instantly shattered, no more complicated than smashing a watermelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this was because Osborne was strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For anyone else, getting close to him would be difficult. The giant waves and undercurrents he controlled with his water element made it hard even for a Class A martial master to approach him. Even if they managed to get close, their attacks might be blocked by his metahuman power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also mastered water elemental power. The waves and undercurrents the man conjured had little effect on him, and the psychic attacks he projected sent him into a momentary daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a duel between masters, a momentary lapse in focus could determine victory or death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the man died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even being a Class A Power Master, once his body was shattered, there was no coming back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Medusa No. 7, seeing her companion of comparable strength killed by Osborne with a single punch, was filled with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, she turned and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce was engaged in combat with Serena, and it would be a while before a winner could be determined. Of her four companions, Osborne killed two, and two were severely injured, leaving only her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't run, she would die here too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Medusa flee again, Osborne chased after her without hesitation. This time, he kept Satan's Eye active, carefully observing the direction of Medusa's escape and potential ambushes or traps, even though he felt such worries were unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Victor and the man in black who had snatched the jewels, the Aberrants had already deployed eight Class A masters, and it was unlikely there would be more ambushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were eight Class A masters, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a lineup was enough to eradicate most ancient families. Just to disrupt the Draco Group's auction, they had deployed eight Class A masters. This should be about their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne, having been tricked once, had to be more cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he did not encounter any more ambushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 fled in panic and was soon caught up by Osborne with his power of controlling water currents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold voice echoed behind Medusa No. 7. Without hesitation, she turned around, her eyes shooting out an incredibly brilliant light. Even her eyes were bleeding at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank, knowing she was going to fight desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had overloaded her petrification power, wanting to petrify his body to buy time to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she was bound to be disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura had already recovered, blocking Medusa's petrification. He controlled the blue Devil's Light to flicker, completely neutralizing Medusa's metahuman power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More blood flowed from Medusa No. 7's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not hesitate, firing the blue Devil's Light, striking her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's body was pierced instantly. A massive blood hole appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked down at her chest with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart and internal organs were all gone&mdash;the blue Devil's Light also completely shattered her internal organs while penetrating her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Osborne, her eyes filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The great King of the Aberrants will not spare you! The great Aberrants will avenge me! I will be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, her body suddenly fell, her corpse drifting at the bottom of the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally killed her! But this is just Medusa No. 7," Osborne frowned in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much more difficult should the stronger Medusas be to deal with? Why are there so many Medusas in the Aberrants? Why did Ms. Hernandez say they are not human? Their bodies are still made of human flesh and blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, he stopped pondering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Medusa No. 7's death, six of the eight metahumans from the Aberrants to disrupt the auction were dead, but the most powerful Bruce was still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he was alive, the Aberrants' operation was not a failure, and Osborne was not safe yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's strength was too terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confronting him, Osborne couldn't even escape through interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, he could only hope that Serena could defeat Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she lost... then everything would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the fluctuations of their battle, Osborne gritted his teeth and still approached, wanting to observe their battle up close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Serena was at a disadvantage, he would help at the risk of his life, even though his help might be useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne approached the battle area between Serena and Bruce. They chose the deepest trench as their battlefield, but even so, the energy fluctuations from their clash created countless massive undercurrents in the sea. Without Osborne's water elemental power, he would have had difficulty stabilizing himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sea surface was now roaring with huge waves. The twenty-two cruise ships were now violently tossing, at risk of capsizing at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this time, Osborne could not care about that anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared intently at Serena and Bruce, desiring to know who was gaining the upper hand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
