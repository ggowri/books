The 17th level of pain had not shattered his will but had instead bolstered it, propelling his upgrade speed five hours ago from +2 per hour to +3.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>17th level of pain turned into 18th, yet his consciousness was still holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His sensory nerves must have gone numb."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors were astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! An 18th level of pain doesn't just numb the sensory nerves; it strikes directly at the soul!" Gerardo retorted sharply, his heart churning with a mix of awe and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here was Osborne, enduring pain at the 18th level for a solid five hours, showing no sign of a mental collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing in the future could bring him down. He wouldn't even flinch if you crushed his heart," Gerardo marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly shocked him was that Osborne's physical strength was about to reach 200.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 200, Osborne's level would surpass even the top-tier</span><span> </span><span>Class S warriors, who stand at 100. Osborne would be twice as strong as them. Even Gerardo himself only had 180.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo thought, "Terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thankfully, the enslavement rate has finally reached 92%! In just ten more hours, his body will be fully enslaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'll become my Human Slave then, my ultimate weapon. He will do whatever I told him to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face lit up with excitement at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Human Slave with a physical strength exceeding 200? This was unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, currently at Class AAA, would see more physical strength once he broke into Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mere doubling would bring it to 400, and tripling it would land him at 600.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes gleamed with a mix of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo mused, "Such prodigious talent. If it were mine, I'd have already been invincible. Even fused with a god's body, my physical strength tops out at 500.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he could reach 600 just by breaking into Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this masterpiece, this marvel, is of my creation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without my Human Slave culture fluid, his strength would never have reached such heights. Such power is the price of enslavement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's pride swelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep a close eye on him! Those final ten hours are crucial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he exited the Human Slave incubation chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over last three days, to replenish the nutrient solution's energy, he had twice extracted the heart blood from gods&rsquo; body, even from his fused Goddess Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extraction made him feel diminished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the feeling won&rsquo;t last. I'll regain my peak in no time. A brief period of weakness for a flawless Human Slave? It's a price worth paying." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo arrived at Ophelia's training chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strange, he thought, as he recalled how, over the past three days, Ophelia had seized every opportunity to pepper him with questions about her training. She showed an urgent desire to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his fatigue, Gerardo decided to offer her some guidance before resting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ophelia was one of his prized disciples, and her growth was important for his future plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flickered in his eyes at the thought, which was quickly masked as he entered the </span><span>rrom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, I'm here to answer your questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked at Gerardo, a calculating gleam in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, what have you been so busy with lately? You seem exhausted. Are you sure you're alright? Maybe you should take a break?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo waved her concern aside. "It's nothing serious, almost over now. Don't worry. I know my own limits. I'll bounce back in a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Ophelia nodded and didn&rsquo;t ask more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cast her gaze down, as if deep in thought, to hide the gleam in her eyes</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was vulnerable right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This moment she&rsquo;s been waiting was now. Without hesitation, she struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, time around them ground to a halt. Everything&mdash;everyone&mdash;became motionless, including Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no delay, Ophelia darted forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three minutes!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
