  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a rational situation, Osborne would never dare to even consider taking a chance with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was a Cosmic Treasure, something even the Deity Kings coveted and yearned to control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy within the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was on a level far beyond divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, still not reaching the rank of Junior Deity, attempting to forcibly extract even the smallest portion of energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was akin to an ordinary person wielding a knife, trying to slice away a piece of flesh from a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention whether it was possible, if he succeeded, the Deity King would surely be enraged, capable of wiping out millions of ordinary beings with just a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same logic applied to Osborne's thought process regarding the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Deity King wouldn't be able to destroy it, let alone control its immense power. The idea of extracting energy from it to refine his Divine Bone and Flesh was not just far-fetched&mdash;it was outright impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if Osborne somehow managed it, the wrath of the Lotus would obliterate him in an instant, leaving nothing but dust behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hell, I'm already in a deadly situation! I might as well go out with a bang rather than suffer this slow, painful death!" Osborne resolved, a fierce determination taking hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to act now. Normal means were out of the question when it came to drawing energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed a special approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That special approach was the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The razor-sharp scythe had never encountered anything it couldn't cut. With his body collapsing, Osborne seized the scythe tightly, maneuvering it towards one of the thin, delicate roots of the Lotus, and struck down with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, an explosive sound rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe met the tiny root, which was many times thinner than a strand of hair, and instead of slicing through, it bounced back violently, leaving a gash on the edge of the scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe was the sharpest and most durable object he had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, trying to cut through this insignificant root had resulted in nothing but failure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be this hard?" Osborne thought, disappointment and dread flooding his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, having noticed Osborne's actions, couldn't hold back his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mirth was dripping with mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have lost your mind! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a Cosmic Treasure! It was born before the universe even formed! Even if the universe were to be obliterated, it would still stand! Not even the highest-ranking Deity King could harm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seriously think you can just slice through its roots and siphon its energy to refine your Divine Bone and Divine Flesh? I must say, your audacity is impressive, and your ideas are rather interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's a fool's errand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you somehow managed to cut it, do you think its energy is suitable for your feeble needs? Using such power for refinement? That's a one-way ticket to oblivion! The only outcome is that your Divine Bone and Flesh will be ground to dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank at Cain's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he knew Cain was right. But this was truly the only option he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What else could he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing idly by as his body crumbled? Watching himself die without even trying to fight back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not going to wait around for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing that the odds were slim, he was determined to make one last desperate attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, his eyes steely with resolve, "If this doesn't work, then I can finally give up and resign myself to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to channel the Breath of Celestial wildly, using its techniques to try to draw energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it seemed utterly futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Breath of Celestial, though a remarkable technique and even praised highly by Isa, held great expectations; how could it possibly harness the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply beyond the realm of possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne resorted to this approach only because he was out of other options and unwilling to sit back and wait for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he decided to give it a shot, albeit with little hope of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne furiously circulated The Breath of Celestial, he was shocked to discover a minuscule stream of energy emerging from the petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grasp of The Breath of Celestial, this energy actually detached itself from the lotus and flowed into the energy stream refining his Divine Bones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne's bones began to crackle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed at which his Divine Bones were being refined skyrocketed, increasing by more than a hundredfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the refinement was utterly thorough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm saved!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
