  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. He thought, "Serena wanted to see me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena Hernandez, the personal attendant to the Godfather, the general manager of the Draco Group in Skyefall, and a martial master for decades, wielded immense power and influence. Even the seven ancient families of Skyefall dared not act presumptuously toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she want to see me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her status, she must know about my relationship with the Godfather. Maybe that was why she wanted to meet me"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not refuse and asked Debbe for the meeting location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, take the people back to headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be extra careful from now on. Activate all defense systems at headquarters and do not leave unless necessary. The Chevalier family might retaliate desperately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded, "Do not worry, boss, I will handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After parting with Valentin, Osborne and Isa headed down the mountain. At the base, a plain sedan awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's red-and-black-colored motorcycle was also nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, thank you for today. If you had not intervened, I might have been in serious danger. I need to meet someone now, so I cannot accompany you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded coolly, "You are going to meet Serena, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated but did not conceal it, nodding, "Yes, she wants to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow but said nothing more, riding off on her motorcycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got into the car and was soon taken to a small rural courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Serena sat at a table with Debbe attending to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne, Debbe smiled and greeted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded back to Debbe and turned his gaze to Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena waved her hand lightly, and Debbe walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena scrutinized Osborne with an assessing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you look a lot like Vivienne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena finally spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "Ms. Hernandez, do you know my mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just knew her. When your parents got married, I did Vivienne's makeup myself. She was very beautiful, the most beautiful woman in Newport City, and only she was worthy of Theodore," Serena reminisced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became emotional. "Senior, can you tell me about my parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am sorry, I cannot. The Godfather will tell you himself when the time comes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt disappointed but quickly composed himself. "What do you need from me, Ms. Hernandez?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to see how you compare to the other heirs of the Augustine family. I am somewhat disappointed; you have fallen behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena said, leaving Osborne feeling stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, what do you mean? Are there other heirs? I thought I was the Godfather's only grandson and sole heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena nodded, then shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are indeed the Godfather's only grandson and heir, but you are not the only heir of the Augustine family. The Augustine family is a vast and ancient family, thousands of years old. The Godfather has siblings, and their descendants are also outstanding and qualified to inherit the family and become the future head of the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked but soon understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was a powerful, ancient family, and the Godfather was its current head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next head did not necessarily have to be the Godfather's direct descendant. Even if Osborne passed the Godfather's tests and became his heir, he would still have to compete with other Augustine family heirs to become the next head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne felt no attachment to the Augustine family and did not care about becoming its head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted to complete the Godfather's test, bring Anastasia to the Godfather's medical research facility, and save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do not care about being the head of the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face turned stern. "You are wrong! You may not care about being the head of the Augustine family, but you must fight for it. Your competitors would not believe you do not care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they know you are their competitor, they will try to eliminate you. With your current strength, you would not survive their attacks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. "You mean they would try to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena said coldly, "Competition in ancient families is always brutal and bloody, especially in a powerful family like the Augustine family. They will do anything to become the head, even kill their own brothers without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, recalling the competition between Ophelia and Justin in the Caldwell family, which was much less powerful. Yet Justin had tried to kill Ophelia multiple times through assassination and poisoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, being thousands of times more powerful, would have even more brutal and bloody competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, feeling the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not help but ask. "Ms. Hernandez, can you tell me how many people are eligible to compete for the position of head of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say I am already falling behind&mdash; so what level of strength have they reached?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
