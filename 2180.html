  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hang in there! You've already fused eighty-five percent!" Primordial urged, his voice laced with anxiety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as Osborne struggled, unable to assist in any way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't hear Primordial's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was enduring the most excruciating pain of his life&mdash;a torment that wasn't just physical but also a profound spiritual oppression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though an unseen force was trying to stop him, warning him that the World Tree fragment wasn't meant for someone like him, a being of lesser standing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure in his soul was relentless, crushing him as if with a thousand blades.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst the agony, a spark of determination ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a rare opportunity, perhaps the only one he'd ever get.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't give up, not even if it meant death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could open his eyes right now, he'd be in for a jaw-dropping sight. On his body, the blood vessels were bulging like massive snakes coiled around. Inside those vessels, the blood was surging like a wild, roaring sea, dashing forward at breakneck speed as if it were trying to burst out of his body. Meanwhile, his skin seemed to have gone through some kind of freaky, otherworldly mutation. Rough, aged bark grew layer upon layer, wrapping him up completely. He looked like an ancient log that had weathered countless years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemingly ordinary log was giving off a terrifying yet incredibly pure and powerful energy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was going through agonizing pain that no ordinary person could even imagine. It was like he was stuck in a living hell. But he gritted his teeth, enduring the searing pain, and kept on holding on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked by, little by little, a miracle finally happened. The bark on his skin started to peel off, bit by bit, like an old and rusty armor being shed. Gradually, his bronze-colored skin was revealed. It glistened with a crystal-clear sheen, just like a perfect piece of pearl, flawless in every aspect, and every inch of it exuded health and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood vessels also gradually returned to their normal state and were no longer bulging. However, even so, anyone nearby could easily sense the wild power coursing through </span><span>him</span><span>. It was like a caged beast, ready to break free at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly but surely, the ever-present pain started to fade away, just like the ebbing tide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne was like a brilliant star, his whole body bathed in a bright green light. This light was soft yet dazzling, as if it were the purest gift from nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant the light faded, a bunch of mysterious ghostly shadows suddenly shot out from Osborne's body. They writhed and twisted like thick tree roots, reaching out wildly into the void. They took root deep in the emptiness, as if they'd forged some kind of mysterious connection with the entire universe. Immediately after, a huge and pure power rushed into Osborne's body like a flood breaking through a dam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, "Whoa, what the hell?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the Chaotic Spiritual Root of the World Tree? You gotta be kidding me!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really managed to perfectly fuse with that World Tree fragment?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he freaking got the Chaotic Spiritual Root of the World Tree? There's no way this is happening...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just a puny Human Community member. What on earth makes him worthy of the Chaotic Spiritual Root!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a real toss-up whether Primordial was stoked or green-eyed with envy when he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne finally cracked his eyes open real slow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat up straight, and all of a sudden, he felt this insane power coursing through his body, and it almost knocked him for a loop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, this is crazy strong!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like if I let this power loose, I could just punch a little planet right out of existence!" Osborne yelped, all giddy with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the World Tree fragment had fully melded with his bones, and his body had gotten a major power-up. His body was already an Infinite Sacred Body. After this upgrade, Osborne didn't have a clue how beefed-up he'd become.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial let out a scoff. "Punch a little planet to smithereens?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's a walk in the park for you now! Your body's meshed so well with that World Tree fragment that you're now in the middle of the Infinite Sacred Body! Your physical strength? It's at least reached the Myriadfold Dragon Might! If you throw a punch with that Myriadfold Dragon Might, even a Supernal Deity King at the Ascension Ten stage is toast if they don't put up a good defense. Blowing up a tiny planet? Piece of cake."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words dripped with envy, but Osborne was over the moon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Myriadfold Dragon Might? No way, it's that strong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the Sacred Dragon Clan was the apple of this cosmos' eye. Their babies popped out with crazy power, making them one of the top dogs when it came to raw physical strength in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myriadfold Dragon Might was a staggering hundred times greater than what a Sacred Dragon Clan member was born with&mdash;an unfathomable strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a Supernal Deity King at the Ascension Ten stage, it would be quite an achievement if they could unleash an all-out attack reaching the level of Myriadfold Dragon Might. Those who could surpass this level were undoubtedly the most extraordinary and gifted prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before fusing with that World Tree fragment, Osborne's physical strength probably didn't even reach the Hundredfold Dragon Might. Yet now, it had soared to the Myriadfold Dragon Might!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an increase of over a hundred times!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne could unleash the Myriadfold Dragon Might with just his physical body alone. How could he not be overjoyed?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just this newfound physical strength, Osborne could go toe-to-toe with a top-tier Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amazing!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne continued to explore the changes in his body, he quickly realized that the benefits of merging with the World Tree fragment extended far beyond just physical power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he noticed shadowy, root-like tendrils stretching from his form.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Osborne thought they might be the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, but he quickly dismissed that notion. The Lotus' roots were blood-red, while these were a vibrant emerald green.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial chimed in, his voice tinged with envy, "Those are the Chaotic Spiritual Roots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think your physical boost is impressive? It's nothing compared to the Chaotic Spiritual Roots you've obtained. I'm actually a bit jealous of you now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confusion deepened. "What's so special about Chaotic Spiritual Roots?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial grunted and said, "It's extremely useful!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've merged with that fragment of the World Tree perfectly, so you've gained some of the World Tree's abilities. From the looks of it, what you've got is the Chaotic Spiritual Root!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chaotic Spiritual Root can take root anywhere and absorb power at an astonishing speed to restore your power! It doesn't just restore your divine power. It can also restore your Sacred Power, soul power, elemental power, and even the power of your physical body. As long as you have the Chaotic Spiritual Root, all these can be quickly restored!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Chaotic Spiritual Root, you'll never have to worry about running out of power again! No matter who you're fighting against, you can go all-out without a second thought. You can even use your trump cards as regular attacks... 'Cause you'll never run out of steam!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless all the power in this cosmos is exhausted, the Chaotic Spiritual Root can devour power and help you recover quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice turned bitter. "This is one of the World Tree's most core abilities. And here you are, getting it before me. It's just not fair. Come on! I'm the World Tree's offshoot, not you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, sulking in frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't care less about Primordial's envy. His heart raced as he processed the implications of the Chaotic Spiritual Roots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With the Chaotic Spiritual Roots, I don't have to worry about running out of power? I can use my trump cards freely? Anything can be restored?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I transform into my second form&mdash;the crimson lotus form&mdash;and use absolute defense, I'll never have to worry about exhausting my power again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I could maintain absolute defense forever, which would make me untouchable by anyone's attacks!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought left Osborne breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could bask in his excitement, he suddenly felt a surge of energy coursing through him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm about to break through to Ascension Four! The Deity King Tribulation is coming!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
