  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gazed at the injured Guy, a satisfied grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his first real confrontation with a genuine Deity Overlord warrior, and the outcome was just as he had anticipated. If he only relied on Thunder Power, he could barely hold his own against a Deity Overlord, and defeating one was quite another challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when it came to dark power, an early-stage Deity Overlord like Guy stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even against a mid-stage Deity Overlord, Osborne felt confident he could put up a decent fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if he unleashed his full power, particularly his spatial power, he could likely overcome a mid-stage Deity Overlord as well. However, going up against a late-stage one would be a different story; he'd probably have to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was no rush for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was only at the early stage of Transcendent Deity. Once he reached the peak of that level&mdash;or even better, broke through to become a Celestial Deity&mdash;defeating late-stage or peak-stage Deity Overlords would become a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had his Infinite Devouring Eyes, constantly absorbing energy, which meant his growth would accelerate rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, his elemental power was on the rise, too; once his space elemental power hit Level Seven, his strength would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "All of that can wait. For now, I should focus on transforming Bruno and Guy into my Blood Clan descendants first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought firm in his mind, Osborne fixed a cold stare on Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, transforming someone like Guy, an early-stage Deity Overlord, into a Blood Clan member would be nearly impossible due to their considerable power gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's body's resistance would make the transformation a challenge, but with him severely injured, his resistance was at its weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne soon encountered a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As his blood seeped into Guy's body, he immediately felt a formidable resistance, preventing him from making any deep modifications to Guy's Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frowning, Osborne said, "Still putting up a fight? It seems your injuries aren't severe enough. Let's see if I can help with that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a flash, Osborne landed a powerful punch on Guy's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strength drove through Guy's body and struck at his divine power essence directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Guy's face drained of color, despair written all over it as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had shattered his divine power essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his divine power essence destroyed, the divine power coursing through Guy dissipated rapidly, leaving him on the brink of becoming a complete shell of his former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was exactly what had happened to Darren!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darren had been a late-stage Deity Overlord&mdash;far stronger than Guy&mdash;but once his divine power essence was destroyed, Osborne had easily transformed him into a Blood Clan member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Guy found himself in the same dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as his divine power essence was obliterated, his body's resistance vanished, and Osborne effortlessly began the transformation into Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Guy's divine power essence? Well, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could heal that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After transforming Guy into a Blood Clan member, Osborne immediately summoned the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to restore his divine power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simultaneously, Osborne turned his attention to Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Bruno was at the late stage of Celestial Deity, his actual combat prowess was significantly weaker than Osborne's. He wouldn't be able to resist the transformation for long. With a couple of agonizing screams, Bruno was quickly made into a Blood Clan member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like under normal circumstances, I can only forcibly transform those much weaker than me into Blood Clan. For those who are only slightly stronger or on par with me, it seems I have to knock them half dead first or destroy their divine power essence before I can proceed," Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that settled, Osborne activated the healing powers of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity on both Guy and Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, they were both restored to their peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They bowed deeply to Osborne, their eyes filled with fervor and reverence. "We serve you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get up! From now on, we're all in this together. When we're around outsiders, just call me Osborne. Act normal so no one catches on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, understood!" Guy and Bruno replied, eager to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's head back. We've got work to do," Osborne said, his mind already racing with plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his objectives achieved, he was ready to return to their base. Now that Guy and Bruno had become his Blood Clan descendants, he could finally unleash his "devouring" scheme within the ranks of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His first target? Guy's elite battalion, a force of 10 thousand warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Guy's cooperation, Osborne was confident he could transform all those soldiers into Blood Clan members in no time at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the entire Wild Flame Army consisted of only about 500 thousand soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he managed to convert Guy's 10 thousand troops, it would mean he had effectively devoured one-fifth of the Wild Flame Army's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought sent a thrill through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he would be on his way to achieving his ultimate goal&mdash;completely devouring the Wild Flame Army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the surface, it would still appear to belong to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion and Lord Malevolence, but behind the scenes, they would answer only to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, once he had fully consumed the Wild Flame Army, the prospect of devouring the entire Ninth Dark Deity Legion didn't seem far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion boasted over two million warriors, making it the undisputed ruler of the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his mind, Osborne found himself breathing a little faster, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, here's the plan moving forward..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
