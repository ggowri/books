  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Comparing Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes to Jethro's Gale of Netherworld was a testament to the sheer power of the former.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jethro was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at just one percent of its strength, the Gale of Netherworld was beyond the capabilities of any peak Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes could stand toe-to-toe with a scaled-down version of that formidable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a swell of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised him even more was how little divine power it consumed. Given the technique's massive area of effect, one would expect a hefty drain on his divine energy. As a mid-stage Deity King, he thought he would run out of divine power quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he found that he only needed to expend a small amount to summon the dark energies of the world. The true cost of the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes lay in his soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul power was so formidable that even Zoe, a metahuman with impressive soul power, was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the consumption felt negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "With the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes in my arsenal, I no longer have to worry about anything below a Supernal Deity King! Even if I'm surrounded by a group of peak Deity Kings, I can handle them easily with this technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I need to practice more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes is a broad-area attack that doesn't distinguish between friend and foe! With my current control, I might end up taking out my teammates before I even hit the enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to work on my control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must master each Shadow Drake I summon. Only then can I channel the full power of the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, making it more focused and devastating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering this, Osborne spoke up, "You all should head back and continue your training! You've all made significant progress lately, but it's still not enough! And don't just lock yourselves away. Make sure to practice with the Blood Demon members when you can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a feeling the Paramount Supreme Clan is gearing up for an all-out war against the Human Community! When that happens, countless Dark Deity Legions will come crashing in like a tidal wave, and you all need to be ready for the chaos of being overwhelmed in battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone nodded, their expressions resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Osborne! We'll be ready! We won't hold you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inspired by Osborne's display of power, they felt a renewed sense of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent eight years in seclusion at Hope Haven, while Osborne had only trained for two, yet their progress paled in comparison to his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between them had only widened, which was hard for them to accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging glances, they quietly left to resume their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne found a vast open space and began practicing the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With deliberate control, he activated a single Shadow Drake, directing it through a variety of movements&mdash;charging, pouncing, tearing, wrapping, sprinting, turning, and spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, the Shadow Drake was clumsy, and controlling it to perform different actions was quite challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's innate understanding quickly shone through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he practiced, he found it increasingly easier to manipulate the Shadow Drake, which became more agile and swift. Soon, with just a thought, the Shadow Drake executed complex maneuvers with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complete control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Osborne summoned more Shadow Drakes, bringing the total to ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the difficulty of controlling them multiplied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the challenge intensify once again. He began the familiar cycle of struggling to control the Shadow Drakes, gradually moving from clumsy attempts to fluid mastery until he could manipulate them as effortlessly as an extension of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he ramped up the number of Shadow Drakes to a staggering hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was terrifying&mdash;a hundred Shadow Drakes surged through the area, wreaking havoc in a radius of 60 miles. The sheer force of their chaotic attacks threatened to obliterate everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to forget that a single Shadow Drake had nearly wiped out Anastasia, Zoe, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, just imagine the terror a hundred of them could unleash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a full month of relentless practice, Osborne finally achieved complete control over all one hundred Shadow Drakes. Each one responded to his thoughts, moving precisely as he commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could direct them to attack separately or coordinate their strikes for a more devastating effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I can finally control a hundred Shadow Drakes with ease! But if I want to manage even more&mdash;like a thousand or ten thousand&mdash;it's going to be a stretch with my current abilities. No amount of time spent would make it feasible. My soul power is strong, but my control over it still needs work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, this is more than enough for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up, I need to focus on breaking through my space and lightning elemental essences! After reaching Level Nine with my dark elemental essence, I unlocked the Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes. I wonder if the space and lightning elemental essences will grant me a similar technique once I push them to Level Nine!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
