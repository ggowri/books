  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A few hundred </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths?" Clara and Leroy both turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't have Satan's Eye, so they couldn't see that far. But hearing that hundreds of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths were approaching, they already felt a bit scared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth had already been demonstrated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their wings can release tiny powder-like particles. These high-energy substances can easily penetrate most contestants' defense shields and are even hard to block with a Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as these powder-like high-energy particles touch them, contestants will immediately suffer burned skin and flesh, looking utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth is fast and highly defensive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if ordinary contestants give it their all, it's hard to kill an </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, at least dozens of contestants died from the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth's high-energy particle powder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And at that time, there were only a few dozen </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now there are hundreds!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If these </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths appear near the contestants' team and attack together with other Abyssal Snakes, Bloody Ivies, and </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bees, they will definitely cause huge trouble for the team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne is taking the two of them to fight against hundreds of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they're not careful, they could die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, thinking of Flash's speed, Leroy and Clara felt relieved, thinking, "At least, if we can't beat them, we can escape. The </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth is fast, but it can't be faster than Flash. We can use guerrilla tactics."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them thought Osborne would choose to use guerrilla tactics.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could use Flash's super speed to continuously harass and hunt on the outskirts of those hundreds of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths. Once the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths give chase, they could immediately escape and then keep looking for opportunities until they kill them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they quickly realized they were wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hadn't even considered using guerrilla tactics. It was indeed safe, but for Osborne, it felt like a waste of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They're just a few hundred </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths. Even if all of them were killed, they'd only be worth a few million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, spending too much time hunting them wasn't worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's plan from the start was to face the group of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths head-on and quickly get their wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Hold on tight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Flash quickly approached the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths, Osborne took out the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and drew the string directly while on horseback.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Power Arrow quickly formed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Clara and Leroy's </span><span>first time</span><span> experiencing Osborne's Sacred Power up close. They couldn't help but feel a bit shocked because Osborne's Sacred Power was incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the state duel, Osborne's power now was even more terrifying. They couldn't even determine how many types of powers Osborne had fused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"During the state duel, Osborne had already fused three types of powers. His Sacred Power was similar to that of Agatha, Horace, and others. But now, Osborne's Sacred Power is even stronger. This might be related to his breakthrough from Ascension Nine to Ascension Ten. However, it's more likely that he has fused a fourth power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can he really fuse four types of powers before reaching Empyrean Sacredness?" Thinking this, Leroy and Clara exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow shot out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An arrow instantly split into hundreds of arrows, each locking onto an </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth and accurately striking its head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a single one was an exception.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow, the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth's strong defense seemed extremely fragile, easily shattered by the Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow carried a terrifying corrosive effect. It quickly corroded their wounds and bodies, causing immense damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Leroy and Clara saw the terrifying </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths fall from mid-air like rain, landing on the desert, struggling a few times before dying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne killed hundreds of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths with just one arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Leroy and Clara take a deep breath. If they hadn&rsquo;t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn&rsquo;t believe such a thing could happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One arrow actually split into hundreds of arrows, and each one still held such terrifying power. Isn't this about the same as the force of our full-strength attack?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just how powerful is Osborne's Sacred Power? The Sacred Power of an average primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior is definitely not this strong." Thinking this, Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, feeling utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it!" Osborne said, thinking it was perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had already fused five powers, including spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, fire power, and his physical strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of these five powers was incredibly formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After fusing together, these five powers brought his Sacred Power to a terrifying level. In addition, the Solar Sacred </span><span>Arrow</span><span> he created himself perfectly matched him, allowing him to unleash the full power of his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, in his view, killing hundreds of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths with one arrow wasn't very surprising.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's quickly collect the spoils!" Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His control over power was strong, and his archery had reached its peak. Each </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth had its head pierced and body corroded, but their wings remained intact and completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara felt they couldn't just do nothing, so they decisively took over the task of collecting the spoils, firmly refusing to let Osborne step in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, all the </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths' wings were collected by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of 360 </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths, and each had four intact wings, so they could exchange them for 4,320,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After calculating clearly, Leroy and Clara took a deep breath again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of 4,320,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the zone duel began, they never dared to imagine they could earn 4,320,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two split these </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth wings," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Leroy and Clara firmly shook their heads and said, "No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara gritted her teeth and said, "Osborne, we did nothing. How can we take these spoils? No matter what you say, we won't agree this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know you want to help us, but we can't do this. We did nothing just now. We can't accept such a share."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne smiled and said, "Didn't you help me collect the spoils? I really don't lack these Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way." Leroy and Clara's attitude was absolutely firm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, after some discussion, they agreed on a new distribution plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took 60% of all the spoils. They were responsible for collecting the spoils, each getting 20%. They refused to take any more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, 20% of the spoils was still a lot. With 360 </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths, each of them could get nearly 900,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were up to them alone, they probably wouldn't earn 900,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in five days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finalizing the distribution plan, Osborne scanned the surroundings again with Satan's Eye and immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Flash, let's go over there. There are about a few hundred Bloody Ivy in that desert. Let's go kill them."</span></p><div class="pagination">
