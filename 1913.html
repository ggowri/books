  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was intensely curious about Osborne's soul power. Why did it burn with a golden flame, and how could it endure for so long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to find out, he decided to send his own soul power into Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, this wasn't a difficult task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power, so few in Celestara could match his mastery over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were significant risks involved in detaching his soul power and entering another's Soul Current Ocean&mdash;namely, the danger of becoming trapped and unable to return&mdash;he felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a Deity King. Even the strongest Deity King wouldn't stand a chance of trapping my soul power. It's utterly impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Adolph settled into a meditative position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He addressed those around him, "You all stay close to my main body. I'm going to detach my soul power and investigate this guy's Soul Current Ocean. There's something strange about his soul power, and it might hold a great secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I confirm his Soul Current Ocean is ruined, I'll return. Make sure to protect my body; nothing can happen to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Paramount Supreme Clan nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Adolph! I'll keep your body safe," assured another Ascension Two Supernal Deity King from the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph nodded appreciatively. "Good! Now, let's see what kind of secrets this guy's Soul Current Ocean holds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a massive wave of soul power surged from his mind. This soul power was completely transparent and invisible to the eye, yet everyone present could feel its immense presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming pressure filled the air, causing their very souls to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other Ascension Two Supernal Deity King felt the weight of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, unable to hide his awe, "Adolph truly is the master of soul power! His soul power is at least dozens, if not hundreds, of times stronger than mine! If he unleashed a full-on soul attack, I'd struggle to defend myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he conjured a divine shield to protect Adolph's body, ensuring that Osborne's still-burning soul power was shielded as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Adolph's soul power was already in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tracing the source!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the fragment of Osborne's soul power, Adolph instantly pinpointed the location of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. Although it was an immense distance away, he successfully traced it. A cold smile crept across his face as he charged forward without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a formless entity, soul power moved with incredible speed. Following the sensed direction, Adolph's soul power swiftly traversed billions of miles, arriving at Osborne's vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really this far away?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was taken aback. For someone who specialized in soul power, detaching it was possible, but the farther it traveled, the more energy it consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could already feel his own soul power weakening significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy's true self is hiding in the North Zone? On a divine peak in the North Zone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was astonished. The distance was staggering, and he could feel his soul power draining with each passing moment. He couldn't afford to dwell on it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zeroing in on Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, he plunged his vast soul power into it. In an instant, Osborne felt his body stiffen, followed by an incredible sensation as something penetrated his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quick probe revealed the source, and his eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?!" Osborne was taken aback, realizing that a massive wave of soul power had invaded his Soul Current Ocean!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Adolph was even more astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his soul power entered Osborne's realm, he was left dumbfounded to discover that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was golden!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "A golden Soul Current Ocean?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What in the world is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this happen? I've trained in soul power for over a thousand years and have never seen anything like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This golden Soul Current Ocean... it feels so invigorating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph couldn't contain his excitement. "If my soul power could remain in this golden ocean, it would undoubtedly grow stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I can't kill this guy; I need to control him and turn him into my avatar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, I'll shatter his soul power, then seize his body and claim his Soul Current Ocean for myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought racing through his mind, Adolph focused on Osborne's soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is just at the advanced Deity King Level, yet his soul power is so vast? When I first broke through to Supernal Deity King, my soul power wasn't even close to this level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy's talent in soul power is at least ten times, maybe a hundred times stronger than mine! To waste such a strong body by not cultivating soul power is absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This body is mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must take it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
