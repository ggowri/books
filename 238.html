  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hundred powerful members of the Chevalier family emerged from the depths of the mine, encircling Osborne and his team, effectively blocking all escape routes from the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's face darkened ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't hide his shock at the sheer force before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Indeed, you can never underestimate an ancient family! The Chevalier family has thrived in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> for a millennium; even the Godfather has to give them some respect. They're formidable, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the entire </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services were mobilized, they'd still be no match for the Chevalier family! But gathering such a massive force must be their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we could wipe them out here, the Chevalier family would surely fall from grace and fade into obscurity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this realization struck him, a glint of determination sparkled in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had killed Apollo, and his vendetta with the Chevalier family was now personal. If they weren't eliminated, he would be in constant danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of dealing with ongoing trouble, so his only option was to destroy the Chevalier family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was ablaze with a fierce fire, a cold smile etched across his face as he strode toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scared stiff, are we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! To challenge the Chevalier family is the biggest mistake of your life! You have no idea how terrifying a family with a thousand-year legacy can be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, beg for mercy! I might just grant you a swift end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, three other Class B+ metahumans stepped forward, their eyes locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them was surrounded by a swirling tempest, the howling winds slicing through the air like blades, leaving destruction in his wake&mdash;a wind elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another was encased in thick layers of ice, wielding the chilling power of frost; with </span><span>each step, he left a trail of frost that sent shivers down spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one was the most enigmatic; he didn't exhibit any overt changes, but wherever he walked, the very fabric of space seemed to warp around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't immediately identify the last metahuman's abilities, but one thing was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four of them were Class B+, far stronger than Apollo, and on par with Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by such overwhelming power, even Osborne felt the pressure mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was still only Class C+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fear didn't grip him; he gestured for Valentin and the others to fall back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking smile directed at Derek, Osborne said, "You want me to beg for mercy? With just you lot? You've got to be kidding! Enough with the chatter&mdash;if you want to kill me, then bring it on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're asking for it, we'll gladly oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" Derek barked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no more words, swinging his arm as a fireball erupted from his hand, hurtling toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fireball glowed with a faint blue hue, radiating intense heat. Everything in its path was instantly scorched to cinders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to be careless; he quickly summoned his Devil's Light, encasing himself in a protective shield of yellow energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The searing heat vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fireball exploded around him, sending shockwaves through the yellow light, but it held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even though I'm just Class C+, this level three Devil's Light, forged from four elemental essences, keeps me on even ground against Class B+ metahumans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he shot a cold smile at Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's expression darkened. "This is just the beginning! I told you&mdash;today, you die here! Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Derek unleashed an even more explosive torrent of flames, engulfing Osborne in a raging inferno. While it couldn't breach the yellow Devil's Light immediately, it applied tremendous pressure on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the others sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind elemental metahuman struck first, summoning a tempest that slashed through the yellow glow of Devil's Light, ramping up the pressure on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the fierce wind roared through the sea of flames, feeding the fire and making Derek's inferno even more explosive and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the immense strain on Devil's Light; if this kept up, it would surely collapse soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, this is powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't about to stand around and let them have their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Osborne prepared to dodge and was ready to employ a hit-and-run strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, his expression hardened once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crushing force, as if a small mountain had suddenly settled on him, hit his body. He felt his body sink, his knees buckle slightly, and every bone in his body seemed to groan in protest. Osborne was utterly immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over his shoulder in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one of the three said coldly, "Trying to run? In my gravity field, you're not going anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gravity control?" Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person's power was to manipulate gravity, increasing it by dozens or even hundreds of times. Osborne could barely lift a foot, much less move, forced to endure the brutal assault of the wind and flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the Class B+ metahuman, who commanded ice, summoned a barrage of chillingly sharp ice arrows. They flew toward Osborne with terrifying speed, their deadly tips glinting with a frosty menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The danger was overwhelming&mdash;an imminent, life-threatening peril.</span></p><div class="pagination">
