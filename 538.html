  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was delighted when he felt the changes in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "My Satan's Eye was supposed to be different from that of the Augustine family, and it was mutated. After that, with Isa's help, I integrated the soul of powers into my body and Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, my Satan's Eye is far more powerful than the others'. I could easily resist the freezing forces of the star power on my first try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The star power also enhanced my body and soul. The stronger my soul is, the stronger my spiritual power will be, and my power will be even more reinforced!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this rate, in seven days, my Satan's Eye will break through level six!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hours later, Osborne was still sitting on the roof of the building, not moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he had completely adapted to the star power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He even found the cold feeling of the star power very comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I can definitely improve my body and soul by absorbing the star power through Satan's Eye. Now I can clearly feel the promotion just by passively absorbing the star power. What if I actively absorb the star power?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more star power I absorb, the stronger my body and soul will be, right? This feeling is even more effective than absorbing the blood diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the blood diamonds can only enhance my body but not my soul!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most importantly, he was running out of blood diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne wanted to continue to improve his power quickly, he would have to find a new way to do so. He had wanted to go back to the diamond mine in Skyefall to see if he could find more blood diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he now felt it might be better to absorb the star power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the star power in the sky was endless. No matter how much he absorbed it, it would never be dried up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Osborne instantly planned to try it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do I have to do to actively absorb the star power so that more of it can enter my Satan's Eye?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne started to give it a try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was going to try to capture it with the pupil of Satan's Eye. He didn't have too much faith, but he succeeded on his first try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne used the pupil of Satan's Eye to instantly capture all of the star power within several dozen yards in a square circle all into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a terrifying cold force erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body was frozen in a flash, and he became a huge lump of ice. His soul was completely frozen, and he couldn't even think.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrible freezing power severely injured Osborne's body, destroying his cells and tearing his soul apart. There was a frantic surge of power in Satan's Eye that rapidly restored the injuries to his body and soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only after half an hour that Osborne's body and soul finally recovered from the freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was breathing heavily, looking quite terrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Fortunately, I'm awake! I was too risky just now, absorbing too much star power at once, and almost directly destroying my body and soul. Luckily, my body and soul were already strong, and the recovery ability of Satan's Eye was enough for me to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, my gains this time were tremendous!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt thrilled in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A large amount of star power was absorbed by him, and his body and soul received a huge boost. If this continued, Osborne felt that he would break through to Class A+ in three days at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was faster than absorbing the blood diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "It's horrible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe only I can absorb the star power so freely, and other people don't have such a powerful recovery ability of body and soul as I do. They might die at once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Godfather might not even do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rested for a while and decided to continue absorbing the star power, but he controlled the scope of the pupil's capture of the star power this time. He would only capture and absorb the star power within a radius of 33 feet once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that case, although his body would still be frozen, it wouldn't be too dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the fiery red sun slowly rose from the east.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The star power in the sky suddenly lost all its freezing power the moment it was exposed to the sun's rays, and it couldn't give Osborne a boost anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Osborne feel disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, he had tasted the success and wanted to absorb the star power twenty-four hours a day in order to cultivate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Forget it. This is already good enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gains from this night were even greater than absorbing five blood diamonds. At this rate, I'll raise to Class A+ by the night after tomorrow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be just in time for the Branch Bloodline Competition!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I must pass the Branch Bloodline Competition to become a recognized heir of the Augustine family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't rest but started cultivating advanced martial art techniques, including Spiral Force, Ninefold Tide Crash, Point Blank Force, Stretch Soft Force, and Deadly Force...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already reached the proficiency level of these advanced martial art techniques, but he was still far from the extreme level, and he needed to spend a lot of time to improve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, there was excellent level above the extreme level!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne kept practicing his advanced martial art skills during the day. With his powerful comprehension and talent, every advanced martial art skill he mastered was improving rapidly, breaking through to the extreme level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Osborne sat down with his knees crossed and captured the star power with the pupil in order to improve his body and soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His state was improving rapidly toward Class A+.</p><div class="pagination">
