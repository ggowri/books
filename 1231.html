  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian quickly laid out the details for Joseph and the other deities of the Deschanel clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"League of Divine Descent is one of the most powerful superpowers on Blue Planet, even before the great upheaval. It comprises thirty-six Divine Families spread across fifteen countries, with the most formidable being the Thornberry family in Marcelin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With revenge firmly on their minds, the Deschanel family sprang into action. They decided to strike while the League of Divine Descent's gods were still in slumber, aiming to eliminate them before they regained their full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph murmured, his brow furrowing. "Thirty-six Divine Families?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're scattered in different locations, which makes it tricky. We won't be able to take them all out at once, and that complicates things. Let's brainstorm how to proceed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the deities said, "We should take out all thirty-six Divine Families! We've just awakened thirty-six of us, so each of us can tackle one family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our power, they won't stand a chance unless their gods are awake! We'll launch our attacks simultaneously. If anyone runs into trouble, call for backup immediately. Given our speed, we can be there in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another voice interrupted, "Not! That's way too risky! The League of Divine Descent wouldn't dare steal from us without having some gods awakened already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They might not have many, but they definitely have some. Plus, they could have methods to temporarily awaken more gods! If we split our forces to attack all thirty-six families at once, we'll be too spread out and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I propose we form six teams of six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each team can target one Divine Family. Even if they have a few gods awake, it won't be enough to stop us! With six teams attacking at once, we can take them down quickly. We can repeat that six times and wipe out the League!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the thirty-six deities of the Deschanel Clan began to argue amongst themselves, each presenting their own strategies for dismantling the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Joseph cut through the noise with a commanding voice. "Enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made my decision&mdash;we'll split into twelve teams! Three members per team, each attacking a different Divine Family! The energy of the world has only stabilized for three months, and thanks to the Sanctuary Caskets, we've regained our strength and awakened quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gods of the League, on the other hand, are bound to be slower in their recovery. Even if they have some awake, they're likely just Junior Deities or, at most, Intermediate Deities, and their numbers won't be that great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three of us can easily take down one Divine Family! Even if we run into unexpected challenges, we'll have enough strength to hold out until reinforcements arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all goes well, we can take out twelve Divine Families in one go! Just three rounds, and we'll have wiped out the League!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we take them down, who will dare stand against the Deschanel Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With confidence radiating from Joseph, his words ignited a spark in the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement, recognizing that his plan was the most viable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's assign the tasks and get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll start with the League of Divine Descent closest to Rosmandi. I'll take the Byrd family in Ransford..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle Felona..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deities of the Deschanel family began to form their teams, each taking charge of a specific Divine Family to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a parallel space, Osborne couldn't help but feel a mix of shock and disbelief as he eavesdropped on their fervent discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The arrogance of the Deschanel family gods is unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They actually plan to divide into twelve teams to simultaneously attack twelve Divine Families? While their analysis might hold some truth&mdash;after all, the League of Divine Descent has awakened only a handful of gods, and their restored powers likely pale in comparison to the Deschanel family's&mdash;there's a genuine risk they could be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they're not completely eliminated, the League of Divine Descent is bound to suffer significant losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's likely that many of the thirty-six Divine Families could soon become nothing more than history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the League of Divine Descent claims to be the descendants of the gods, so they must have some ace up their sleeves. They won't go down without a fight! Let the Deschanel family and the League of Divine Descent tear each other apart. Ideally, they'll knock each other silly so they won't turn their attention toward the Augustine family in Newport City&mdash;giving me enough time to grow stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained hidden in the parallel space, patiently waiting for the Deschanel family gods to finalize their battle plan. Once they confirmed their strategy and set off in groups of three from the sanctuary toward their target, he began to contemplate his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I go take a peek?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated. The scale of this impending genocide was monumental and missing it would feel like a lost opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he was curious about the League of Divine Descent's true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, there was Mila, waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about her innocent, trusting face made him shake his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. They need some time to get there. I'll take Mila back first! I wonder if Divine Shadow is the same 'Ms. Divine Shadow' she's been searching for."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne quickly departed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
