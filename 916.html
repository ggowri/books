  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shot Osborne a playful glare, then stood up and walked over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered softly in his ear, "Hmm, I've been waiting for you for so many years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a tingle run through him, his ears buzzing at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, something felt off. He thought, "I've only known Isa for just over half a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she possibly have waited for me for years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne brushed it aside, pulling her closer and grinning. "You're not planning to escape today, are you? You promised that if I could beat you, I could do whatever I wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa giggled. "Why would I run? If I wanted to escape, I wouldn't have admitted defeat in the ring. I'd just play dirty! Besides, what could you possibly do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew full well that, given his current strength, he could never truly defeat Isa. If she decided not to let him touch her, he'd be completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa seemed ready for whatever was about to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was filled with warmth, igniting a fire within Osborne that he could no longer resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip around her waist, pulling her petite frame into his embrace, locking eyes with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, tonight, I'm going to have you! I'm going to use all one hundred and eighty of my moves on you! You'll see who really runs this house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's cheeks flushed red at his bold declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a teasing look and replied coolly, "What's this? Can't beat me in the ring, so you want to take it to the bedroom? I think you're just all talk; you might not even be my match there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a spark of irritation flare up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, do you really want to underestimate me? I'm going to show you what I'm made of! You'll know who the real master of this house is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait, and I'll make you beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne scooped Isa up in his arms and dashed into the room, tossing her onto the bed before pinning himself down on top of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed playfully. "Make me beg for mercy? You better put in some effort. If you can't handle it, I might just end up on top of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he leaned down and captured her lips with his, silencing her playful banter. Isa melted into the kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck and responding fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths quickened, becoming heavier with every passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they were entwined, bare bodies pressed against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, you said I could do whatever I wanted, right?" Osborne asked, his voice low and sultry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-huh," Isa replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why don't you help me with your mouth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne was sent flying across the room, landing hard on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched his chest, bewildered. "What just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face was flushed, and she shot him a warning glare. "Not a chance! Do you want to do it or not? I'll just get dressed and walk out, if you don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay, let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scrambled back onto the bed, suddenly cautious. He could sense that even though Isa seemed open, she was tense, her body coiled with nervous energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle touch, Osborne entered her, and Isa stiffened, wrapping her arms tightly around him, her nails digging into his back, leaving trails of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Osborne gasped, the sensation sharp yet exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He softened his movements, trying to ease her into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the initial discomfort faded, Isa began to respond with soft, rhythmic moans that filled the room, urging him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was determined to teach Isa a lesson in the bedroom, pouring all his energy into every movement. The sounds of their intimacy echoed until the first light of dawn finally broke through the curtains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nestled her face against his chest, tracing circles on his skin with her fingers, lost in the afterglow of their shared moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go," Isa murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank, and he furrowed his brow, looking at her intently. "Isa, can't you stay just a bit longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, her expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her power is rising rapidly. I need to find her, and fast! This world is changing dramatically, whether you realize it or not. If I don't track her down and team up with her soon, we could be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like the Dark Deity locked away in the Augustine Estate's dungeon. He shouldn't have awakened, but here we are&mdash;he's back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there are more Dark Deities stirring from their slumber."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, alarm flooding his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled sharply, a cold wave of realization washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't respond immediately. Instead, she locked eyes with him, her gaze intense. "Osborne, do you remember the myth I shared with you the first time we met?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he remembered; Osborne nodded slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice drifted back into his mind. She had recounted an ancient tale, one that spoke of gods battling for followers, igniting wars across the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, they had enraged the God of Night, a member of the Court of the Sun.</span></p><div class="pagination">
