        <h1>Chapter 301 Leave Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"IVF? I have already asked Dr. Louis and he said that even if you choose to go for IVF, your uterus may not be suitable for the fetus to survive. Besides, your ovaries are showing signs of premature failure, so it's doubtful if you'll have healthy eggs. Madeline, please don't be stubborn on this issue, okay? Even if your family helped our family back then. In the past few years, our Bryant Group and the Glory Group have been doing a lot of business together, and your Glory Group's income is much higher than your financial support at that time. According to reason, our family doesn't owe your Mayers family anything," Laura added. She looked at me and couldn't help but show a hint of disgust in her eyes already.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was a look that I was more than familiar with in my last life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, I also procrastinated and didn't want to divorce Elliott. At that time, the way she looked at me was a hundred times more repulsive than now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize that in this life, I had only won Elliott's love for me, yet I still lost on the child's part.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, seeing as we've gotten along quite well these past few years, would you give Elliott and I a little more time, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew she could not wait, but I still didn't want to divorce Elliott right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing me say that, so Laura sighed heavily. Suddenly, she pulled out a bank card and two agreements from her pocket and handed them to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there's 50 million dollars. All you have to do is agree to divorce Elliott at night and sign these two divorce agreements, and the 50 million dollars will be yours as compensation for you, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize that Laura actually thought I wanted money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>50 million dollars ...... Huh, what did she think I was?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was also the only daughter of the Mayers family. To be honest, I really did not care about the 50 million dollars at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, I don't want to divorce Elliott because I cherish this marriage with him. I am not in it for the money. Besides, my dad is still unconscious, so I really don't have the mood to talk to you about this. I hope you can understand me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed the card and the divorce agreements back at her. I then stood up, never wanting to talk again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura saw that I was going to leave and got anxious all of a sudden. She hastily tugged on my hand and then suddenly increased the amount.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then in addition to these 50 million dollars, I'll give you another 0.5% of the Bryant Group's shares, is that okay? You don't have to think that 0.5% of the Bryant Group's shares is very little. The Bryant Group is now so grand in scale, even 0.5% is already a lot."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned and looked at the bejeweled old lady in front of me. Originally, I thought there should be some emotional attachment between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, since I married Elliott, I also called her "Laura" for three years. But in that moment, watching her try to kick me out, I realized that there was no love between her and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as Laura was concerned, I was nothing more than a tool for procreation. And if I can't procreate, then I have no use for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were still really cool with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I married Elliott because I loved him. I also had no regrets about the two billion dollars back then. I know you've never cared for me, and you probably look down on me as your daughter-in-law. But at least you should remember that I once helped the Bryant family. I won't divorce Elliott unless he divorces me himself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, I made my attitude firmly known.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was immediately annoyed. And I shook her hand right off and left without looking back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's just because of past relationship that I don't want to argue with you. But if you keep delaying the divorce, I will definitely take action!" Obviously, she was angry and shouted extremely loudly behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused in my steps as if I'd been poured hard. But instead of turning back, I left the coffee shop with determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to step out of the coffee shop, I suddenly caught a glimpse of a girl in a long dress sitting in a corner not far from the booth where we had just sat, covering her face with a gauze scarf...</span></p></div>
