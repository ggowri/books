        <h1>Chapter 797: She Was Driven Out</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I strolled through the garden, inhaling the floral scent, simultaneously absorbing the vibrant energy around me. My mood instantly brightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flood of memories surged through my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I'm reminded of that Mid-Autumn Festival years ago. Back then, Elliott and I were lying side by side right here, moon-gazing... Time really does fly. In the blink of an eye, we've been through so much together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was all personally designed and maintained by Mr. Bryant in his spare time. He said you'd come back one day. I didn't expect, you really did."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, Sean suddenly materialized behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that familiar voice, I spun around in surprise. There stood Sean, not far away, clad in a slate-grey uniform. His face still wore that gentle smile, and in his hand, he held a pair of floral shears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like he makes it a point to tend to these plants every morning at the crack of dawn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought these old friends would only remain in my memories. I believed we'd never have the chance to meet again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, as Sean stands before me, I can't shake the feeling that nothing has changed at all. I find myself laughing, almost involuntarily:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sean, long time no see, you still look as robust as ever."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where have you been? Ever since you left, my hair has turned significantly grayer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean just chuckled and shook his head. It was only then that I noticed his hair had indeed turned white. Suddenly, I felt a lump in my throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's been quite a few years since I tied the knot with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I divorced Elliott, not a single member of the Bryant family spared a thought for the youth I'd wasted or the sacrifices I'd made for him. Only Sean genuinely cared about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back, it's truly a poignant and sigh-inducing memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've worked hard, Sean."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I was at a loss for words. Looking at this garden, I couldn't help but utter a word of thanks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Mr. Bryant has a spare moment, he often comes here to sit, sometimes even tending to the flowers himself, watering them and such. I can tell, you know, that Mr. Bryant misses you every day. Come back. You're both still young. Things will get better with time, they always do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean stepped forward, speaking to me with a weighty seriousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could see the sincerity in his earnest eyes. But we've been through so much together. How could these issues possibly be resolved just by me returning home?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound deep within my heart still throbs subtly, it's not healing as quickly as I'd hoped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are certain things I just don't want to bring up anymore. But that doesn't mean they're all in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's tough to piece a shattered mirror back together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I forced a bitter smile. I looked at the elderly butler as if he were my own kin. My heart ached with a reluctance to part, yet I found myself at a loss for words. So, I chose silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had wanted to move in before, but Mr. Bryant chased her away. He said, this is your home with him. There won't be another mistress in this house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as if Sean could read my thoughts. He let out a soft sigh, gave my shoulder a reassuring pat, and added.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I knew who he was referring to when he said "she"...</span></p></div>
