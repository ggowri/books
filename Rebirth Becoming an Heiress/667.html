        <h1>Chapter 667 Attend the Banquet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was with Elliott in the past, I spent most of my time pleasing him and guessing what he wanted to talk about. I always struggled to find topics when we had awkward silences, but even then, I occasionally annoyed him, and I felt pressured and afraid that he would find me annoying during our conversations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after I proposed a divorce that his attitude underwent a noticeable change, but even so, there still weren't many deep topics to talk about between him and me most of the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, all these years, I just loved him, but never really understood him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I speculated in my heart, while chatting with Quinn as if nothing had happened. I didn't know the reasons, but I always felt like there were two pairs of eyes in the crowd occasionally staring at me, and they were coming from the center of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, every time I looked up, I saw that Elliott was still busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been accompanying his parents, bowing to the people who came to bid farewell incessantly. It was obvious that he was the main person in charge of the funeral, so many people approached him to inquire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was soon time to bury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the grand funeral procession was arranged and set off one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn drove the car, following behind the procession at a distance. We drove all the way to the entrance of the cemetery, and then walked together with others, completing Jasper's final journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was over, the Bryant family specially hosted a feast to entertain everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had originally wanted to leave early, but I didn't expect that Quinn and I would coincidentally run into Grey, who was also on his way back from the funeral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey heard that I wanted to leave early, so he suddenly grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't go. The Bryant family hosted a banquet. Why aren't you attending? Since they invited you, you should attend with dignity. It's okay. You are now part of my family. Even if something happens, Quinn and I will protect you well. Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Grey, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to explain. However, Grey kept pulling me and never gave me a chance to defend myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I'm here. You don't have to worry about anything. Let's go in together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Grey finished speaking, without giving me a chance to speak, he grabbed my hand and pulled me into the Bryant family's banquet scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike the extravagant scene when Elliott and Giselle got engaged, this time the banquet was much smaller than before. I don't know if it was influenced by the previous event or if the Bryant family deliberately chose to keep it low-key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey was always the central figure in the social circle of Hoswich city. It was really difficult to appear low-key when being with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had just taken our seats when several wealthy ladies quickly approached and surrounded me and Grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Woods, is this the Madeline you were talking about? She looks really beautiful. Both her appearance and figure are top-notch. I really don't understand what Mr. Bryant was thinking back then. He actually cheated on his wife for that mediocre woman. It's truly incomprehensible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, on this occasion, let's not rub salt into his wounds. Some people are just not suitable for that. They get better after divorce. Look, Madeline looks so good. It shows that she is still happy in the Woods family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the Woods family is indeed a century-old aristocratic family in Hoswich city. The Bryant family cannot compare to them in this aspect. It's just that the Woods family is accustomed to keeping a low profile, otherwise the richest family in Hoswich city might not be the Bryant family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p></div>
