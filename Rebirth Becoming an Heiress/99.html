        <h1>Chapter 99 The Venue Had a Problem</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, at this time, was actually only 28 years old. However, perhaps due to his long-term experience in the business field, he had a mature and sophisticated demeanor. On this day, because we were hosting foreign dignitaries, we remained serious and did not engage in any casual conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dikio's visit to the Bryant Group was clearly very important. On the way, Elliott looked at his watch several times, his furrowed brow and mature, solemn demeanor evoked a sense of awe in those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite constantly telling myself not to get attached, I have to admit that Elliott indeed had a unique charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, we arrived at the airport and waited on the tarmac for the arrival of Dikio, our VIP.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as their private plane was smoothly landing on the ground, Elliott suddenly received a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know who the person calling was, but when he received the call, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? The venue still hasn't been set up? And Giselle is still unreachable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was eight octaves higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his words, I instantly understood what was going on. It seems that Giselle did not handle the matter well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you immediately think of other ways, no matter what, don't tell me it's too late. I don't care what method you take, in short, there must be no mistakes in this matter. Otherwise, all of you will have to bear the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shouted into the phone and then angrily hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his appearance, I asked quietly beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said impatiently, "There's a problem at the venue. Giselle and I had agreed on a time to set up, but I don't know why she didn't come. She didn't answer her phone either. They have contacted her mother now, but her mother doesn't know anything. The flowers haven't been delivered on time either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott truthfully explained the situation to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing him say that, I immediately responded, "Then I'll call Paige. She has the materials and team ready, I'll have her rush over to help first, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at his watch, and he knew there was no other way at the moment, so he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately went to the side and called Paige. After Paige received my call, she reassured me and told me to leave everything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Paige. Although she used to love playing and fooling around, she was still very meticulous in her work and wouldn't make any mistakes. So, hearing her say this, I felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished the call, not far away, Dikio's VIPs had already disembarked from the private plane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without caring to have any more conversation with Elliott, I made an OK gesture and immediately, we both showed polite smiles and walked over quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott fluently conversed with the Lumarians, exuding a strong presence and speaking with a steady tone. He didn't need any translation assistance at all. Meanwhile, I supplemented the conversation timely and started chatting with the female members of the VIP group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Lumarian pronunciation was trained by my foreign teacher since I was young, so my pronunciation is equally good, and there is no problem with communication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chatted while walking out of the VIP channel, and each of us got in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arranging for them to get in the car, I distinctly saw Elliott give me an approving expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Actually, you don't know about many of my hidden talents, I am not as ordinary as you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, you only saw the radiance emanating from Giselle in your eyes and never gave me a chance to show myself at all.</span></p></div>
