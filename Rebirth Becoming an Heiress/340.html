        <h1>Chapter 340 Discover the Clues</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment and quickly looked at the direction her finger pointed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, my eyes froze when I saw these women.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them were indeed Laura, and the other one looked like Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them actually walked into a B ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene shocked me completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura went with Giselle to the B ultrasonic room?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought about last night in the bar when Giselle said she was pregnant. Could it be possible that she was actually pregnant?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But judging by Elliott's attitude towards her, it seemed that he didn't love her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Giselle possibly be pregnant?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of questions suddenly popped into my mind. Seeing my confused expression, Paige reached out her hand to wave in front of my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what happened? Is that Laura? Who is accompanying her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard her words, I nodded in agreement. "It seems to be Laura. The other one is the woman I told you last time, Giselle. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I occasionally complained to her about Elliott and Giselle in our three-person chat group, so Paige knew something about Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Laura is accompanying that woman to have a </span><span>B-mode ultrasound</span><span>? Does this mean that she has Elliott's child? Oh my god, we need to ask them!" Upon hearing this news, Paige was filled with anger. She immediately stood up and wanted to question them </span><span>with </span><span>me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get excited and be careful with your child. Have you forgotten what the doctor told you?" I quickly grabbed her when I saw her getting angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we must go over there and ask them!" Paige's bad temper remained unchanged as she continued to yell at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go alone. You stay here and don't leave without my permission." I quickly held her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible. I must go with you!" But Paige was so stubborn that she stood up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps </span><span>because </span><span>she stood up too violently</span><span>, s</span><span>uddenly, she shouted out, "No, my stomach hurts again. God, it hurts."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled and quickly supported her. "What's wrong? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her belly, and her entire face turned pale. At that moment, I didn't have time to worry about what Laura and Giselle were doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I noticed her pale face, I immediately took her to the doctor's office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, we were still in the hospital when the doctor immediately provided her with infusion treatment upon noticing her changes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I had settled her down, an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the bed, Paige was having an infusion and looked at me with a guilty expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry, Madeline. I didn't assist you and actually got in your way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your health is more important than anything else. The two people we just found may not be Laura and Giselle. After all, if Laura wanted to have a body check, she would go to Bryant Hospital first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought about this thing carefully in my mind, and then suddenly I felt Laura was unlikely to come here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true. The Bryant Hospital has more advanced equipment than this hospital has." After hearing what I said, Paige agreed with my idea. So we were completely relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stayed with her in the hospital until her infusion finished and bought her lunch to eat together. Then, I drove her home to ensure that she would stay at home and rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I finished all these matters, it was already afternoon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott called me and said that the Bryant Hospital got ready to welcome my father's transfer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I went home to take a shower and changed my clothes. Then I went back to the hospital where my dad was hospitalized.</span></p></div>
