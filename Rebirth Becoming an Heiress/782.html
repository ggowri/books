        <h1>Chapter 782: He's Been Waiting for Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott's name flash across my phone screen, I instinctively furrowed my brows but picked up nonetheless:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why haven't you returned yet? I've been waiting for you all this while."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the line, Elliott's tone was urgent yet tender.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like I told you, I'm staying at my folks' place for a while. I won't be coming over, you should get some sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, with a patience I was barely holding onto.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott fell silent for a few seconds, then his slightly magnetic voice echoed once more:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm coming over, wait for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to be so relentless. I told him I wouldn't go, yet he insisted on coming to find me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, it's too late. Don't come over, I'm already asleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily declined over the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure if Elliott was angry or not. All I heard was the "beep beep" of a busy signal on the other end of the line. He'd hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the clock, it was already past ten in the evening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been by Elliott's side these past few days, utterly exhausted. My time in the hospital has been a constant state of worry, sleep eluding me. Without a second thought, I hung up the phone and collapsed onto the bed, falling asleep instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, my phone rang again. It was Elliott, calling past one in the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott woke up with amnesia, being so clingy was something I hadn't anticipated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack had drilled it into my head a thousand times not to get on his nerves. So, I reluctantly picked up the phone, saying with a hint of annoyance:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're calling again? Why aren't you asleep at this late hour?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the other end of the phone, his deep voice resonated, and boy, was he pissed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lied to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was baffled, unsure of what he meant: "What did I lie to you about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you were staying at your parents' place? I'm right here, downstairs, and your place is empty. Your neighbors told me you moved out a while ago. Why didn't I know about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice held a note of questioning, a hint of doubt. I realized, his memory was still stuck in a time when we were still married, when he thought we still lived in our old place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just recovered from his illness, yet here he is, not sleeping at this late hour, but hanging around under my apartment. What on earth is Elliott up to?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss for words and helpless:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, even though we're... we're married, you can't expect me to be by your side 24/7. I have my own personal freedom, don't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uttering the words "husband and wife" is truly a struggle for me. But right now, I have no other choice, I can only force myself to pretend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I yearn for sleep, but without you, it eludes me. Madeline, where are you now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was soft, laced with a hint of weakness that stirred a sense of compassion within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then it hit me. If I let him keep pestering me, treating me like his woman just like before, expecting me to be by his side every second, I fear I might lose my mind. Moreover, I'm genuinely afraid that if I keep playing this role, I might slip up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I'm already tucked in. Please, no more messages tonight. Goodnight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a ruthless heart, I abruptly hung up the phone, then buried my head in the covers, ready to drift back into slumber.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my sleep quality is truly worrisome. Elliott's call disrupted my slumber. I tossed and turned in bed for a long time, unable to drift off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My phone rang again at two in the morning, it was a call from Barry by the sea.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant just got discharged from the hospital today, and he's already drinking. Dr. Jones strictly advised against any alcohol. But, I can't seem to stop him."</span></p></div>
