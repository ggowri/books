        <h1>Chapter 754: Fortuity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, it's all in the past now. Let's look forward to the future. Madeline, you don't have to worry. From now on, Noah is our child, shared among the three of us. We'll both help you take care of him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We held each other, crying for a good while. It was only then that Fiona, her tears finally subsiding, spoke to us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, all the stuff I bought for Miky, I've given away. Everything for Noah is brand new. I've come to see Noah as my own child. Once he's out of the incubator, and you're busy with work, I'll help take care of him. I've read up on a lot of parenting books, you know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Paige finally managed to calm herself down. She wiped away the tears on her face and said to me with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget about me, I'm an obstetrician, I can take care of kids better than any of you. If Noah ever gets sick, you can always come to me. I've already prepared a small room for Noah in my apartment. When he gets a bit older, he'll always have a room at my place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of you are scrambling to be Noah's mom! But no matter what, you can only be his mom. There can only be one dad, and that's me. So don't even think about competing with me for that!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn watched as our spirits lifted once again, finally chiming in with a chuckle. I could clearly see the tension in his furrowed brow ease. It was obvious that our renewed happiness had brought him some relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the dad, no one's contesting that. But being a dad isn't a walk in the park. If you want to be a dad, you can't just be good to Noah, you've got to be good to Madeline too. You're up for that, right Quinn?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige slapped Quinn's shoulder with a laugh, addressing him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it obvious? We all know that what Quinn has done for Madeline far surpasses what some others have done."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Quinn could respond, Fiona immediately chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, are you feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were all just chatting when suddenly, the feeble voice of Jane echoed from the doorway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound startled me, and I turned towards the door in surprise. When I saw Jane, her head wrapped in bandages, her arm in a cast, being supported by Marcus at the entrance of my hospital room, I immediately struggled to rise from my bed to greet them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected it, but before I could go see her, she came to see me first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of her shielding me time and again, coupled with the sight of her injured, was enough to bring me to tears:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, I'm alright now. How about you? Are you in pain? Are you uncomfortable? Why aren't you resting properly, instead of coming here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, my heart aching, unable to stop myself from asking a barrage of questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a minor injury, nothing serious. Some rest will do the trick. I'm worried about you, though. Even though Mr. Brown said you're fine, I needed to see you with my own eyes to be at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane approached, and we clasped hands. As we looked at each other, our eyes brimmed with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though my acquaintance with Jane was brief, this ordeal brought us closer than ever. Only those who've faced life and death together can truly understand the bond we share.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, stay put, don't try to sit up. Jane, she's taken a fair share of hits, but rest will mend her. You, on the other hand, have undergone an emergency C-section and suffered heavy bleeding post-surgery. You need to rest, don't rush to get out of bed. Once you've regained some strength, I'll prescribe you some medication to get you back on your feet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my persistent attempts to sit up, Marcus quickly stepped forward to dissuade me. He waved his hand, his gaze stern, adamantly refusing to let me get out of bed.</span></p></div>
