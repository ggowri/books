        <h1>Chapter 524 Feeling Embarrassed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Carole, Quinn's face turned red instantly, and he waved his hands frantically. "Carole, it's okay. My stomach suddenly doesn't hurt anymore, and I have enough strength. I can just go by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confronted with Carole's formidable presence, Quinn suddenly became timid, and all his mischievousness from earlier vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be like that. Don't just torment Madeline. Give me a chance to serve you, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole, now grinning devilishly, walked over to the bed. She didn't care whether Quinn was injured, and with a firm tug, she pulled Quinn off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, you're killing your own brother! Ouch, ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that pull, Quinn nearly felt like he was dying. He screamed, tearing me between wanting to laugh and feeling sorry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a man. What's a little pain? Come on, let's go. You said you needed to pee, right? I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Quinn's howls, Carole grabbed his ear and dragged him out after pulling him off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Quinn wailed all the way, being dragged to the bathroom by Carole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed and followed them out of the ward, only to find Adam, Leonel, and Hardy standing at the door. Obviously, the scene just now had been too much for them to resist bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I thought you were a force to be reckoned with, but Carole just raised the bar!" Adam teased with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. How's the situation downstairs now? Why are you all up here?" I asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our anti-flu capsules are now hailed as miraculous by the doctors. Many severe patients have been discharged, and there are fewer and fewer patients downstairs. The doctors are prescribing the medicine for mild cases to take home. We haven't had much rest these past few days, and the staff can manage the situation now, so Dr. Muller asked us volunteers to take a break. He said he wants to talk to you later when he is not busy." Adam briefed me on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, got it. To thank us for our help, the hospital has set aside a few rooms as temporary rest areas. You guys haven't had a proper sleep in days. Go get some rest," I urged Adam, Leonel, and Hardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been practically working around the clock downstairs these past few days. They all looked weary, and with the limited hospital facilities and their rushed arrival, they transformed from young lads into weathered men in just a few days, which really tugged at my heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried them off to rest, and not long after, I saw Quinn being pushed and shoved by Carole all the way back from the bathroom, grumbling all the while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, you're hopeless at taking care of people. Compared to Madeline, you're way off the mark! No wonder you're still not married at your age!" Quinn complained to Carole as they walked, unable to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You jerk! Keep blabbering, and I'll tell everyone about the time you wet your pants!" Carole flushed with anger, shouting loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stifled a laugh, and just then, Quinn spotted me standing at the doorway, startling him into quickly covering Carole's mouth with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, don't say nonsense, okay? Don't you care about my reputation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn roared, infuriating Carole, who slapped his hand away and yelled, "You didn't even wash your hands, and you're covering my mouth! Quinn, I... I swear I'll beat you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole stormed off to grab a mop from the nearby janitor's closet, immediately swinging it toward Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was startled. He bolted towards me, dragging me into the ward, and slammed the door shut behind us!</span></p></div>
