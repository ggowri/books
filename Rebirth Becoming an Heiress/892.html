        <h1>Chapter 892: She's Gone Mad</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was terrified, her eyes brimming with tears of injustice, on the verge of breaking into sobs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa stepped forward, her voice cool and detached, "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, your divorce proceedings caught quite the public eye, it's no secret. But whether you two actually went through with it, only you two know the real score. The rest might just be rumors swirling around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott is now suffering from amnesia, a fact well known to Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she saying this on purpose, trying to stir up doubts in Elliott's mind?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott were to grow suspicious and start investigating, he could indeed find some leads.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, those things are bound to clash with his memories. What might happen if he gets triggered again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed forward, assertively and firmly grabbing hold of Elliott's hand:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, the whole divorce thing was just a joke between us, we're actually madly in love. Elliott, don't mind them, let's get on with the competition."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yanked Elliott away without a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, fearing I might misconstrue his past with Lucy, quickly clarified:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there was never an engagement between Lucy and me. I just found her innocent and adorable back then. I didn't dislike her, so I agreed to date her. I just didn't expect her family to be so status-conscious."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone has a past. My dad once tried to arrange a suitable marriage for me, too. I get it, no need for explanations."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My original intention was to have Elliott brush off the matter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he asked me with a hint of unhappiness:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Which family is he from? How come you've never mentioned him before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We never dated. No need to bring him up!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I need to know. Tell me. Now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Elliott was consumed by jealousy. Without a word, he wrapped his arms around my waist, right there in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go. A lot of people are watching us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he not let go, but he also kissed my cheek right in front of everyone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think it over, if you don't spill his name, I'm not letting you go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been years, I've forgotten all about it. Elliott, let it go, this is just embarrassing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately tried to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this once aloof man has become passionate. He rolls over, one hand cradling the back of my head, the other pressing against my waist, forcing my body to lean back. I can only rely on him to keep from falling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips drew infinitely close to mine, and at the same time, the faint scent of his cologne, mingled with the fresh aroma of the golf course grass, invaded my nostrils.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't speak up, I'm going to kiss you right in front of them, until you do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, absolutely not!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit, Elliott's words truly rattled me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sure as hell don't want to kiss him in front of all these people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," I say, "it's that family, the one that started in the same machinery business as mine. That's just my parents' idea, though. In reality, I've never even met the person. I have no idea what they look like."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." Elliott chuckled with a knowing smirk, "I've seen him. A chubby little guy, neither as tall nor as handsome as me. Your parents could learn a thing or two from your taste."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sense of crisis immediately lifted, and Elliott released me with satisfaction. He swung his club with a smug grin, sending another beautiful shot into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa and Lucy are just a stone's throw away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, he simply treated them as if they were nothing more than air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was all smiles, accompanying me with impeccable service. Yet, I could distinctly feel the piercing gaze of four pairs of eyes, like four knives, constantly stabbing me from the shadows.</span></p></div>
