        <h1>Chapter 336 He Is So Good</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Elliott was a man possessed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he drove me mad as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end, I couldn't even feel the cold anymore. I was exhausted and thirsty, feeling like my bones were coming apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My clothes were all torn to shreds, and they were no longer in use.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped me in his overcoat and carried me to the car. Then, he laid me across the back seat and turned on the heater.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too spent from his relentless passion to even fight him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There I lay, aching all over, and yet...there was an indescribable sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was shameful, really.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never experienced such madness before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My lips were parched, desperate for water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott found a bottle of water in the car and handed it to me. I was so thirsty that I instinctively reached out to grab it. But to my surprise, he pulled his hand back and took a big gulp himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at him, so furious at his selfishness that I wanted to scream. But my throat was too dry, and the words wouldn't come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he wanted the water all to himself, but then, with a sly grin, he suddenly leaned in and kissed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was forced to open my mouth, and he started passing the water to me, sip by sip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we weren't already married, I'd have died of embarrassment right there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a wave of warmth washed over me as we grew intimate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he laid the seat back, the car seemed to expand. He kept feeding me water until I pushed him away, showing I'd had enough. Only then did he lie down beside me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out his arm to pull us close, and we lay side by side in the car. Exhausted, we cuddled in silence for a while before Elliott finally spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop making me angry. Stop doing things that upset me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't mention Quinn again, but I knew he meant he didn't want me getting too close to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then stop seeing Giselle," I challenged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," he said, his tone serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to agree, so I instinctively turned and leaned on him, "Really? Then make her leave Bryant Group. Tell her to stay out of your life, how about that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, but you also have to promise me you won't see Quinn without my approval. Whatever happens, you should think of me first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott actually agreed, which surprised me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you always have to answer my calls."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart, which felt incredibly insecure, finally found a sliver of satisfaction. His chest was still bare, his broad muscles undeniably sexy and tempting. I couldn't help but draw circles on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal. I'll set a unique ringtone for your calls."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed my hand suddenly and then gently kissed me on the lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that tonight would be like the old times when we would end up fighting over a misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I finally see where I stand in his heart...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was funny how those impossible contradictions had found a way to work themselves out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quietly nestled in Elliott's arms, and just then, he suddenly opened the sunroof of the car and muttered, "Look, stars."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, I'd been too angry to notice how beautiful this place was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until he opened the skylight that I realized how beautiful the stars above were.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this is amazing..." I couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled me closer into his arms again, and I heard his rare hearty laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I drive here alone. I found that this place is quiet late at night. That's why I wanted you to see this beautiful view."</span></p></div>
