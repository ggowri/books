        <h1>Chapter 421 Her Downfall</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw it. It was indeed impressive.Ken, if Bryant Group's PR exploits this public opinion to boost Jezebel, there might be a chance they can turn the tide and steer everything in a positive direction?" I voiced my concern straightforwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brief pause was on the other end of the line before Ken responded, "That's possible. Haven't people made a name for themselves through infamy before? But don't worry. I always keep an ace up my sleeve. I've got a trick or two left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he have an ace up his sleeve?" Ken's words instantly made me nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly asked, "What other tricks do you have? Have you stumbled upon something recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken chuckled mysteriously over the phone, "I can never keep anything from you. You truly were my most tacit game partner back in the day. Yes, Jezebel recently had a secret meeting with Mr. Hall, a top executive at Netflix. They spent some time at a hot spring, and I captured the entire rendezvous with my camera. Furthermore, I even caught them in some intimate moments. I went to great lengths to get this footage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's words filled me with excitement instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic, Ken. Now that you've mentioned it, I feel relieved. Name your price, and it's a deal!" I couldn't wait to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is no need to haggle between us. If you want it, I'll send it over right away. As for the payment, it's up to you. Just remember that as long as you consider me a friend, anytime you need me, it's just a call away," Ken declared over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years of no contact, I hadn't expected that he still treated me with the same loyalty as when we played games together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling touched, I quickly expressed my gratitude over the phone. Ken promptly sent me all the photos and videos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched the video of Jezebel and Rickson frolicking and embracing in the hot spring pool, I instantly formed a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this material in hand, there would be no chance of Allure airing on Netflix. As for Jezebel, while Giselle aimed to make her famous, I was determined to bring about her downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling jubilant, I quickly drove to the new home where my parents and I were about to move in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arrival, Quinn escorted my parents to the doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, we helped my father out of the car. After swiftly settling in, I took them around the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although my parents had bought this place, they rarely visited and were unaware of its lush surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick tour, my parents were pleased with our new abode. Because my father was still quite delicate, I only took them for a stroll and escorted them back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I really appreciate your help today. Why don't you stay? I'll cook up some good dishes for lunch," Lily said. She and Quinn were already getting familiar with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Lily. I've heard your cooking skills are top-notch, so I'm staying to taste it myself," Quinn replied promptly. He was never one to indulge in false politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, make a list, Quinn and I will go grocery shopping. There's a large supermarket nearby. It's convenient," I chimed in with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll take care of your dad and let him rest. After all the hustle and bustle, he's tired."</span></p></div>
