        <h1>Chapter 293 Heartless</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She now seemed to be a member of the Bryant family. On the contrary, I, as Elliott's wife was like an outsider.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Giselle, raised my hand, and was about to slap her hard in the face and teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as my hand was about to fall on Giselle, I suddenly heard Elliott's cold voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head in disbelief and saw Elliott was still wearing the same suit he wore when he went out in the morning. He elegant, dignified, and looked aloof. But he was now looking at me coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked and subconsciously wanted to step forward. However, those two bodyguards blocked my way like an iron wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was standing so close from me, but he had no intention of approaching me at all. His voice was still cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go back first. If anything happens, I will call you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, stay with your grandpa. It's okay, I'll talk to Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle rushed to Elliott. She held Elliott's arms affectionately in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her action made my heart tighten. But I noticed Elliott's solemn face and he didn't even push her away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if I suddenly understood something, my heart seemed to be pierced by something. I staggered back two steps. Looking at Elliott, who was not far away from me, my heart suddenly ached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his actions of deleting videos and comments were not enough to show his attitude, then his words and actions at this moment are enough to explain everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To protect Cormac's health, he planned to distance himself from me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our affection last night was not worth mentioning in front of the deep family affection. Now that he had such an attitude, it made no sense for me to stay here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't say anything more but looked at him deeply, then turned around and left quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't stop for a moment, I felt suffocating. It wasn't until I ran out of the hospital door that I finally covered my chest and gasped for air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My phone rang just then. I picked up the phone. When I saw an unfamiliar number, I answered the call suspiciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, who's there?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, are you Bruno Sullivan's family members? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's voice on the other end of the phone sounded anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am his daughter, who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard the other party suddenly mention my father's name, I was very confused and asked hurriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, we are from the police station. Your father just had a car accident. Now we have notified the ambulance to take him to the hospital. Please come immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was in a car accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind suddenly went blank. The phone almost slipped from my hand...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is my dad doing now? Is he okay? Is it serious? I'm still in Louis City, I'll rush back immediately! "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly panicked. I asked quickly with a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation is not good now. Please come here with your family as soon as possible..."</span></p></div>
