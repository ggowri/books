        <h1>Chapter 42 Paying the Bill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was afraid that ordinary formal attire would tarnish Mrs. Bryant's reputation, so I had it custom-made a long time ago. I hope you don't mind my extravagance and wastefulness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched him as he spoke slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me and said lightly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, as long as it looks good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the shop assistants collectively lifted up the dress, probably because it was too valuable. There were a total of eight of them, working together to lift it up along with the hanger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dress was pure white all over, with sparkling diamonds hanging all over the skirt. It had a strapless design at the chest, and the waist was extremely narrow, which really tested the wearer's figure. Luckily, I was slim enough, so there shouldn't be any problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I went to change my formal attire, ha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blinked at Elliott and then entered the fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several shop assistants took off the evening gown and helped me put on the dress. Afterward, they styled my hair according to the design of the dress and touched up the makeup on my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I walked out of the fitting room, it had already been half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, who used to get impatient with me even for a minute, sat outside waiting for me for a whole half hour this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood in front of the mirror, and through the mirror, I saw myself as beautiful as a goddess. To be honest, even I myself was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white lining of this dress complemented my skin tone like cream, and the cutting design of the dress was very unique, outlining my figure perfectly, especially the design at the hem, which was elegant and chic. The sparkling diamonds adorned the skirt, as if immersed in a brilliant galaxy, it was simply beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was tall with a small face. Due to practicing dancing since I was young, my neck was very slender. Combined with light makeup and beautiful features, my appearance was no less impressive than any top celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently gazed at my noble and elegant self in the mirror, unable to resist falling into self-admiration. And at that moment, Elliott unknowingly stood behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warm palm suddenly landed on my exposed shoulder, and the tingling sensation that came from my shoulder made my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, it was very beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picky as Elliott was, he even forgot to be picky when faced with the dress and me, and for the first time ever, he exclaimed in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will I not be embarrassed if I dress like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly and discreetly pushed his hand off my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he once again placed his hands on both sides of my waist, and his head suddenly leaned towards my neck, silently gazing at our reflection in the mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electric-like tingling sensation made me unable to move my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath lingered in my ear as he gazed silently into the mirror, his expression as if he too had been lost in enchantment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he never paid attention to my appearance and never thought I was beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, his eyes clearly showed a hint of infatuation, a bit of impropriety, and he himself seemed to be completely unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, I didn't expect your wife to be so beautiful. Not only does she have a great figure, but she also has an exceptionally noble temperament. When you two stand together, it's truly a perfect match, a match made in heaven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shop assistant timely delivered compliments at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to realize just now that we were still in someone else's store, and there were several shop assistants around us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go of me and immediately skillfully took out his black card from his pocket, saying to the shopkeeper:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paid the bill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked really handsome when he paid the bill with his card, his movements were smooth and without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder so many women flocked to him, so many women were conquered by his damn charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dress is worth millions of dollars, but he didn't even ask about the price. He just paid the remaining balance directly.</span></p></div>
