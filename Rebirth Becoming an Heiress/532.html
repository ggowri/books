        <h1>Chapter 532 Share the Burden</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I were silent for a long time after Elliott left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Quinn who spoke up to break the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, he asked softly, "Madeline, will you blame me for being too impulsive in doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn. To be honest, I didn't anticipate his action, and it stirred excitement within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think you're being too impulsive in doing this? If Carole goes back and tells your parents, how are we going to get along then? You know very well that the baby in my belly is not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, before I finished my sentence, Quinn directly held my shoulders, locked eyes with me, and said, "This isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. I've been contemplating it for the past few days. As time passes, your belly will definitely bulge, and you can't hide your pregnancy. Without someone to share the burden with you, you will have a hard time. Being a single mother is no walk in the park. Besides, the baby can't grow up without a father's love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sincerity was remarkable. It was clear that he was concerned for my well-being with all his heart and soul, without even pondering about what it would mean to him if he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the only son of the Woods family, a prominent family, so how could his parents approve of him marrying a divorced woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the baby in my belly was not Quinn's and was born without any resemblance to him. How could the Woods family not suspect it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, a good man, didn't need to make such a monumental sacrifice for me, let alone endure the potential humiliation of raising another man's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blessed with a prestigious family background and striking appearance, he could easily have his pick of any woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Quinn and I had always been good friends. I never planned to change the relationship or owe him more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head vigorously. In case there were any potential eavesdroppers outside the ward, I stepped forward and closed the door before turning around. Looking at Quinn, I said earnestly, "It's all my choice even if I'm having a hard time. Quinn, we are just friends. I don't need you to take on so much for me. Do you understand? Call Carole and tell her it's all just a joke. Otherwise, we won't be able to fix it once your parents learn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn held my shoulders again with extraordinary determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want to bear it with you, instead of seeing you struggle alone. I am a man with no future. Since the death of my girlfriend, I've lost her and any hope I had in life. Marriage and children aren't in my plans anymore. So why don't you let me share the burden with you? Don't have any pressure. Madeline, I just want to give you a proper identity to shield you from the gossip. Also, if anything happens, I'll be there for you, and you won't face it alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected that Quinn's outward casualness concealed a depth of affection as vast as the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's girlfriend passed away so many years ago, yet he made the decision to remain single for the rest of his life in her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted again, "Quinn, you have done enough for me. I don't need you to sacrifice so much for me. Do you understand? You're still young. There may be someone in the future who can help heal your past wounds, someone even better than your girlfriend. You don't have to give up your future for me, and I can't afford it. Having chosen to become a single mom, I am ready to face all the gossip. This is the path I'm going to take!"</span></p></div>
