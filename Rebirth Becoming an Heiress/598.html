        <h1>Chapter 598 Jezebel's Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jezebel who appeared unexpectedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she had come to visit upon hearing the news of Giselle's childbirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was dressed in an expensive silver-gray fur coat with a silver strapless long dress underneath, seductive red lips, curly hair, and crimson high heels. Jezebel exuded an extremely enchanting aura, and even from afar, one could smell the strong scent of her perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing sunglasses, Jezebel deliberately put on a haughty demeanor, with her assistant carrying a large bouquet of flowers and a gift bag following closely behind. Despite the bustling crowd at the hospital, hardly anyone recognized her, yet she pretended to be afraid of being photographed, swaying her hips as she walked towards the hospital entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, the image of that night on the yacht between her and Philip surfaced in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a wave of disgust wash over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paige whispered in my ear, "Is that the celebrity named Jezebel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's words caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Could it be that she already knows about Jezebel and Philip?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to her and asked, "She's not that famous. How do you know her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige replied disdainfully, "Because Philip brought home a few magazines with her on the cover, each photo intentionally revealing her figure. I was curious, so I looked her up. That's how I know she's Jezebel Carlton."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Is Philip under some kind of spell? How dare he bring magazines featuring Jezebel home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is outrageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to keep Philip away from these improper women. This woman has had a lot of scandals, rumored to have had sexual relationships with many people in the entertainment industry. Tell him not to be reckless while you're pregnant and get involved with women like her!" I couldn't help but say angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice wasn't loud, but to my surprise, Jezebel heard it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally intended to walk straight into the hospital, but upon hearing my words, Jezebel suddenly turned around. With an intense gaze, she looked at me and Paige, and I distinctly noticed the rapid rise of hostility in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although we hadn't formally met before, Jezebel probably knew who I was due to her relationship with Giselle. However, I wasn't sure if she knew that Paige was Philip's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly walked towards me, raising her hand with crimson-manicured nails, pointing at me assertively. "Who were you just talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never had a good impression of Jezebel. Seeing her behave so rudely only fueled my disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly retorted, "I was talking about someone who has had multiple sexual relationships with many people. I didn't mention any names. Are you so angry because you're the person I was referring to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heavily made-up face instantly showed an angry expression. She walked up to me, saying in a sharp voice, "You despicable woman! How dare you speak of me like that! Do you even know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, she lacked self-awareness. I couldn't help but laugh and replied, looking at her coldly, "I don't know. There are too many unknown small-time stars in the entertainment industry. Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel, who had previously disguised her arrogance, now revealed her true colors. She looked at me, after some internal struggle, and couldn't help but say angrily, "I didn't recognize you before, so you're the ex-wife Mr. Bryant abandoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you end up here? Did you hear about Giselle giving birth and couldn't accept it, so you deliberately came to the hospital to inquire about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't help but fiercely retort against Jezebel, "Don't talk nonsense! Madeline broke up with that unfaithful man on her own initiative. Jezebel, you're a celebrity. Is it appropriate to argue with us in public like this?"</span></p></div>
