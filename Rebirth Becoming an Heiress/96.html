        <h1>Chapter 96 Temporary Husband</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seems to be the first time I saw Giselle posting on Instagram, other than advertising for her flower shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Giselle is very happy that Rowan has found a good job and is willing to buy a house in Hoswich. So, Giselle announced her relationship on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking my phone, Elliott was clearly disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I observed his expression carefully and speculated that Elliott had feelings for Giselle, even though there was no spark of love between them at the moment. Otherwise, Elliott wouldn't have had such a reaction upon seeing the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This man looked very handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I continued to provoke Elliott. However, Elliott lowered his head and elegantly ate a piece of steak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a young man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to be in the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Young men, on the other hand, would make girls happy. For example, my assistant is considerate and romantic because he brings me various delicious foods every day. But certain mature men are busy with work every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly raised his head alertly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was your assistant a man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I returned to the Glory Group, Elliott hasn't paid much attention to my work, so he is not aware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was a young man who had just graduated." I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to suddenly become angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said coldly, "Transfer him to another position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were already married, so you had to be mindful of boundaries! Your assistant couldn't be a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave me a command that I could not disobey, arrogantly and coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! He was smart and capable. He could help me with work. Besides, I just treated him as my younger brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The principle I currently adhere to is always going against Elliott. If Elliott asks me to go east, I will definitely go west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott angrily stared at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what I said, you didn't listen, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were my temporary husband, not my father. I didn't interfere with you, so you don't need to interfere with everything about me. Right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I continued to argue against Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly put down his fork and stared at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was I your temporary husband, Madeline? Do you still want to divorce me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what Elliott meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had always wanted to divorce Elliott. And, I made it very clear...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking into Elliott's eyes and thinking about how he brought me to such a romantic restaurant tonight, I suddenly felt that I shouldn't have brought up divorce now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no objections. It was mainly for your convenience. If you find true love, I can leave at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to shrug casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was clearly dissatisfied with my answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said coldly, "Madeline, marriage is sacred! Don't bring up divorce so often! It's not auspicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised and chuckled when I heard Elliott's words.</span></p></div>
