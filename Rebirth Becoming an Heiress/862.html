        <h1>Chapter 862: She Pleads for Forgiveness in a Hushed Tone</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apologies?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't she just put on a whole spectacle at my doorstep yesterday? And now she's apologizing to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Elliott's illness, I would've exposed her true colors right then and there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just here to celebrate Elliott's birthday today, there's no need for you to apologize to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I set down my fork, speaking with an icy indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura glanced at me, a hint of guilt in her eyes. Subconsciously, she looked towards Jasper, then abruptly grabbed my hand, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Jasper and I spent the entire night talking yesterday. I've come to realize that I've wronged you in the past, and I've done things I shouldn't have. Given how much Elliott adores you, and considering he's our only son, we should treat you with the respect you deserve. I promise you, I won't treat you the way I did before. I'll regard you as my own daughter. I hope you can put the past behind us and forgive me, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's words came across as deeply touching.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to lay into her with some sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott set down his fork, glanced at Laura, and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's gotten into you today? Such a sudden change of heart? If you'd felt this way earlier, Madeline and I wouldn't have had to go through so much turmoil. We might even have had a child calling you 'grandma' by now. That would have put grandpa at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's still grappling with amnesia, I reckon they haven't broken the news about his grandpa's passing to him yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura awkwardly muttered:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, I admit it. I was wrong before. Your dad gave me a good talking to last night. I went too far with some things. I get it now. Madeline's so young, how could I just decide she can't have kids? Medicine's so advanced these days. I truly regret it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I finally got it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden change of attitude was due to regret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because I didn't agree to let her see Noah yesterday, and she saw how warmly I treated the Woods family, that she took some time to reflect on her actions when she got home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her past actions being way out of line, I wouldn't have kept her from seeing Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Noah is Elliott's child, a fact that is undeniable no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she said these things to me before the whole Giselle incident, perhaps I could have forgiven her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's all too late.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her words of regret, not a ripple stirred within me. I responded coldly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All that's in the past now. If every harm in the world could be mended with a simple 'I'm sorry', wouldn't that mean murderers could get off scot-free?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was initially filled with anticipation, but at those words, her face instantly turned sour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at me, disbelief etched on her face, her hand reaching out to grasp mine. But I pulled away, instinctively shifting my body a bit to put some distance between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hadn't uttered a word, but I could feel his eyes, always watching us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's always been a man of few words. Through my marriage and divorce with Elliott, through it all, he's just been a bystander, never voicing his opinions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after all these years, I've come to know them quite well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's a bit wary of Laura. And a lot of things, even though he doesn't say anything in front of us, he's definitely discussed them with Laura behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, it was always Laura who took the spotlight, with Cormac controlling the situation at home. Thus, at times, he felt like an invisible man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed lightly, finally breaking the silence:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, we're not just offering a verbal apology, we admit our mistake. To express our regret, Laura and I are willing to give you five percent of our shares in the Bryant Group each."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten percent stake in the Bryant Group?</span></p></div>
