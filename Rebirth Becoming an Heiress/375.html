        <h1>Chapter 375 I Only Love You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because my current appearance was truly haggard, Elliott's eyes showed clear concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how messy and unattractive I looked at the moment, with no semblance of grace, Elliott couldn't help but lightly kiss my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions clearly showed love and concern for me... I became increasingly puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that things have happened, what do you plan to do next?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't act out of spite anymore. I increasingly felt that perhaps everything was just Giselle's scheme, and I absolutely couldn't act recklessly now. I couldn't distance myself from Elliott without enough certainty of the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This happened very suddenly, but I hope we can face it together. Once you recover, I'll call Giselle out alone, and we will confront her directly. How does that sound to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suggested in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, rather than blindly walking into Giselle's trap, it was better to confront her face to face and get some clarity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I didn't hesitate further and agreed directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression relaxed. He held my face, his eyes showing a sense of regained joy. He said, "I thought you might ignore me without reason. It seems you're more rational than I thought..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was happy because of the sudden change in attitude, looking more relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things have happened, of course, we need to clarify them first. But I want to know, do you have any feelings for Giselle at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared directly into his eyes, confirming repeatedly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, he had fallen madly in love with Giselle by this time. To be with her, they openly cohabited, and he spared no effort to divorce me. He even said many heartless things to me several times just to achieve his goal of divorcing me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of pain still made me shudder when I recalled it even now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't worried about any woman around him, but if it was Giselle... I still couldn't let go of my guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes remained calm, his tone decisive, not at all like someone who liked Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps sensing my lingering doubts, Elliott lightly kissed my forehead again. Then, he suddenly said something that made my cheeks flush and my heart race.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the only one in my heart now, no one else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though our relationship had been good before, and our feelings were strong, Elliott had never said such words of affection before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he made an exception, wanting me to trust him enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I involuntarily trembled slightly all over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who had endured countless lonely nights, as a lover who had begged for his affection, as an admirer who had tried everything to win his favor... God knows how long I had waited for such words and how much effort it took.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but softly whisper his name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could finish my words, he lifted my face and kissed my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar taste and touch instantly turned all my excitement and resentment into nothingness...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what happens, I won't let go of your hand again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, when love runs deep, even saying sweet words becomes addictive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott muttered again, and before I could react, he was already holding my face, kissing and nibbling, as if holding onto a precious treasure about to be lost. That wild yet restrained kiss left me with no strength to resist at all.</span></p></div>
