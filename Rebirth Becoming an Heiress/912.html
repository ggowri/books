        <h1>Chapter 912 He Finds Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I joined an international charity organization in college and took care of babies in an orphanage for a while. </span><span>R</span><span>ead a lot of books on childcare</span><span> at that time</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he took out his phone and showed me some photos from his album.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately recognized </span><span>the younger Elliott</span><span> in the photos, wearing the charity organization's uniform, holding a foreign baby in the orphanage's nursery, surrounded by several other college students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems he was telling the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah's fever has been recurring. He's so </span><span>little</span><span>, and we're afraid to use medication. Every time he gets a fever, we're on edge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the sleeping Noah and sighed with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It could be roseola. Kids can have high fevers for several days, then break out in a rash. Don't worry. I'll stay here tonight and help take care of him. If the fever doesn't go down, we'll take him to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> patted my shoulder and comforted me softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah likes </span><span>it to be </span><span>quiet when he sleeps, so we tiptoed out of the nursery, leaving Malina to watch over him, and went to the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that </span><span>Elliott</span><span> had managed to </span><span>get</span><span> Noah's fever</span><span> down</span><span>, </span><span>much of </span><span>my mom's anger towards him </span><span>disappeared</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She now sees Noah as her lifeline. Anyone who is good to Noah can be forgiven for almost anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes and asked </span><span>Elliott</span><span> grumpily:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hungry? I'll make some </span><span>pasta</span><span> for </span><span>you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> was definitely hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been standing outside </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>dusk</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> late at night and had just been busy for a long time. His growling stomach answered for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, make some for me too. I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I winked at my mom, but she glared at me before turning to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you should go to bed. Elliott and I will take care of Noah tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw my dad yawning on the sofa, so I quickly said to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, just keep an eye on him and call me if anything happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad stood up wearily, gave me </span><span>this</span><span> quick </span><span>word</span><span>, and then </span><span>went</span><span> to his bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> and I sat down on the sofa, facing each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked around the house and then slowly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The layout here is nice, but it's a bit small. I have a property in the neighboring villa district, managed by a </span><span>house </span><span>caretaker. It</span><span>s </span><span>facilities </span><span>are well with</span><span> high security. Why don't you and your parents move there with Noah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa district... That's one of the most expensive properties in </span><span>Hoswich</span><span> City, with limited availability and strict purchase requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. My parents are used to living here, and it's fine for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't figured out </span><span>where I&rsquo;m going next</span><span>, so I don't want to accept too much from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>looked up</span><span>, his gaze deeply fixed on me, and then he softly asked:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah... he's my son, isn't he? I just saw him, and he looks almost identical to my childhood photos. Madeline, can you tell me the truth? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I've forgotten many things, I'm willing to take responsibility for you and the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it. Noah </span><span>looked</span><span> so much like him that he would definitely notice once he saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to respond, so I chose to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My silence gave him the answer. He immediately looked overjoyed, leaned forward, and knelt in front of me, holding my shoulders with his hands, his eyes visibly excited:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Noah is my son, right? Madeline, tell me the truth&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah is my child. As for </span><span>the</span><span> father, it doesn't matter to me. When I decided to have him, I also decided to raise him on my own. </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, please stop asking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ecstatic expression made me uneasy. I was afraid he would try to take Noah from me, so I spoke up first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to understand my thoughts immediately. He quickly grasped my hand:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know it must have been very hard for you to raise this child. I also know I've done many things to hurt you in the past, and you can't forgive me easily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't worry, I won't take Noah from you. But I really want to help you take care of Noah and love him. For the sake of the child, let's start over and give him a complete family, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s words were very sincere. I could tell he had opened his heart and was treating me with genuine sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to speak, but at that moment, my mom's voice suddenly </span><span>appeared</span><span> in the living room:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, I don't agree! Noah is already registered under our family name. He is part of the Mayers family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>, it was your Bryant family that kicked Madeline out because you thought she couldn't have children. Now, she and Noah have nothing to do with your family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you dare to </span><span>take</span><span> Noah</span><span> back</span><span>, I will fight your family to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although my mom had a slightly better opinion of </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, Noah had become her untouchable </span><span>redline</span><span>. Anyone who tried to interfere would face her fierce protection, like a mother hen guarding her chicks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>D</span><span>on't worry,</span><span> Lily,</span><span> I won't take Noah away. I just hope you won't shut me out and let me fulfill my duties as a father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> stood up immediately and said to my mom after hearing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. If you knew this would happen, why did you act that way in the first place? </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, your relationship with Madeline is over. Nothing you say now will change our minds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finish</span><span> your </span><span>pasta</span><span> and leave. We'll take care of Noah ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom's remained firm. She had always been kind, </span><span>and</span><span> she had never given anyone such a cold shoulder before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that my mom was deeply angry with </span><span>Elliott</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go eat your </span><span>food</span><span> before it gets cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want </span><span>Elliott</span><span> to upset my mom any further, so I gave him a look, signaling him to eat the </span><span>pasta</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We walked to the dining table together. I noticed that my mom had not only made </span><span>pasta </span><span>but also thoughtfully fried two eggs, as if worried we wouldn't have enough to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tough-talking but soft-hearted old lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh and invited </span><span>Elliott</span><span> to sit down with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as we were </span><span>starting to dig in</span><span>, the doorbell rang...</span></p></div>
