        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to speak, Elliott abruptly pulled me to my feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was cold as he addressed his father. "Dad, divorcing Madeline is out of the question. If that's the only reason you called us here tonight, then we're leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination in his eyes, Elliott turned to leave, pulling me along with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't be stubborn! You know the situation with her body better than anyone!" Cormac's voice was pleading, tinged with frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, your grandfather has always cherished you. Have you thought about his feelings?" Laura implored, her tone softening slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, we only want you to have a child. Remember how reluctant you were to be with her in the beginning? What changed?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Elliott was ready to leave, his parents and grandfather all stood up and wanted to convince him to stay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, I glanced at Elliott and found his gaze locked on mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I saw unwavering determination in his eyes, I almost believed that he was truly in love with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my wife. Regardless of her condition, I will stand by her. There's no need for further discussion."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott declared firmly, his grip on my hand tightening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held my hand so tight that our palms were covered with sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words melted my heart, and I couldn't help but look at him with newfound admiration. At that moment, I realized that his love for me ran deeper than I had ever imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that my love for him was a hopeless mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I felt myself falling for him all over again, captivated by his unwavering loyalty and his willingness to defy his elders for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer had to plead for mercy as I had in my previous life. Having him by my side was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart raced, and I knew that my eyes must have been filled with love as I looked at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hungry? Let's go grab something to eat," Elliott murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was soft and tender. And then, to my surprise, he leaned in and kissed my cheek in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed, feeling the weight of the evening's tension lifting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled back at me, his eyes sparkling with happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't leave just yet. I... I'm pregnant with your child. Don't you owe me an explanation?" But just as we were lost in our own little world, Giselle's voice cut through the moment like a knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, shattering the blissful bubble we had created.</span></p></div>
