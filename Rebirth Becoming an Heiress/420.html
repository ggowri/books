        <h1>Chapter 420 Trending</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hit the gas pedal and sped off. Glancing in the rearview mirror, I saw Giselle's shocked expression as her phone slipped from her grasp, probably because of the news she had just seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she dream that the enthusiastic recommendation of her bestie, Jezebel, would result in such a deluge of scandalous revelations, especially right before Allure was set to premiere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her face fall, I couldn't help but smirk wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hummed a tune, feeling an inexplicable sense of satisfaction as I recalled the conversations between her and Jezebel at the hospital that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Adam called me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware that I was the one orchestrating Jezebel's exposure, he excitedly exclaimed over the phone, "Madeline, I have the most incredible news! Someone just leaked all the dirt on the lead actress of Allure on Twitter. It's juicy stuff! She's been escorting and partying since high school, sharing a boyfriend with her mom, and taking intimate photos with her ex... You name it, and it's all out there! The PR team at Bryant Group must be losing their minds right now. They can't control the comments. The whole internet is buzzing! I bet the reputation of Bryant Group's show is utterly ruined. At this rate, that woman might even get blacklisted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam kept on talking non-stop, clearly thrilled by the scandal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled. If Adam was this excited, I could only imagine how thrilled those online gossipers must be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, I responded to him over the phone, "That's fantastic news. It's like the heavens are on our side. With this happening at such a critical moment, I bet their deal with Netflix is going down the drain, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard they've already signed a deal with Netflix. Plus, Bryant Group has a pretty close relationship with the higher-ups at Netflix. There's been no word of cancellation so far. But if Bryant Group can swiftly resolve this PR crisis, there's a chance Netflix will still air the show as planned. After all, infamy can still bring in viewers," Adam said worriedly over the phone. His last line made me nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, infamy could still generate attention. If Bryant Group put in the effort to turn public opinion around, these scandals might actually work in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Jezebel had been relatively unknown before, but now, thanks to these explosive revelations, she was a household name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bryant Group's PR team was savvy enough, my secret manipulations could become their trump card if they managed to sway public opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I could never let them have any chance of turning this around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up with Adam, I immediately called Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you seen Twitter? It's getting more and more exciting. I never expected so much buzz around a minor star signing with a big company like Bryant Group. It's quite unexpected," Ken's hearty laughter came through the phone as soon as he answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the mastermind behind the scenes, Ken was delighted with his "work" this time.</span></p></div>
