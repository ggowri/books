        <h1>Chapter 784: His Innermost Thoughts</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beer bottles littered the floor. Under the dim light, Elliott slouched in the middle of a dark green sofa, a bottle of beer in his hand. His black shirt was carelessly unbuttoned. The flickering light cast shadows on his face, making him appear even more disheveled and icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, Barry instantly relaxed. He quickly leaned in and whispered:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant has already downed over ten bottles of booze. Neither Mr. Woods nor I could talk him out of it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a nod, waved my hand, signaling him to leave. Then, I made my way towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed oblivious to my presence. He lifted his beer to his lips, ready to take a swig, but I snatched the bottle from his grasp. I furrowed my brows, my voice icy as I spoke:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Elliott, no more drinking! What the hell are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott scowled, his first glance at me was filled with palpable anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he realized it was me, the anger in his eyes dissipated instantly. He grabbed my hand in a swift motion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I knew it, I had tumbled right into his arms. The strong scent of alcohol hit me instantly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're here. I knew it, you couldn't bear to leave me behind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yearned to rise, but his hand was already wrapped around my waist. "Elliott, don't," I pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evidently, Elliott was drunk. He buried his head in the crook of my neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move, it's been a while since I've held you. I just want to hold you tight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's head was heavy. I tried to push it away, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't. I was frustrated:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, quit fooling around. Let go of me, I'll take you home!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Elliott hadn't heard my words. Suddenly, he cupped my face, gazing at me with such intense affection:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, do you know when I fell for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were hazy, as if lost in a sea of pleasant memories. His deep, affectionate demeanor left me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm here tonight purely out of humanitarian spirit, intending to take him back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't expect him to suddenly hit me with this question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never mentioned when he started falling for me. Even in our most passionate moments, he never uttered the word 'love'.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he's conveniently forgotten, daring to utter such words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words instantly piqued my curiosity, prompting me to ask:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat up and I thought he was going to let me go. But instead, he pulled me into his embrace, forcing me to press tightly against his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-lost heartbeat echoed powerfully in my ears, instantly stirring up memories that were once buried deep within my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of intimacy left me at a loss. Just as I was about to push away, he softly said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first time I fell for you was the night you played the piano. Before that, I never knew how beautiful you could look, sitting at the white piano, your delicate hands dancing over the keys."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm somewhat touched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words instantly yanked my thoughts back to that time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he wouldn't know. That piano performance was my all-out effort to impress him after living a second life. That's why I played so earnestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, I was determined to show him that I wasn't as lousy as he thought I was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you're just smitten, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I arched an eyebrow, questioning.</span></p></div>
