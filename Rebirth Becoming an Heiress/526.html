        <h1>Chapter 526 He Came</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flew to Oliver's office, and he was waiting for me in his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of me, Oliver was very kind and addressed me with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, this time, your recommendation on this medicine eased the overcrowding in the hospital and reduced the pressure of epidemic prevention in Carthage by a lot. The government has now ordered the full closure to be lifted. Quite a few media outlets have recently come to Carthage to report on the anti-epidemic initiative. I also made it a point to publicize this medicine of yours in my interviews."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver looked at me with a great deal of gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Few things could satisfy me as much as I went from rejection to full recognition.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled, "Dr. Muller, it's an honor for us as a company to be of assistance. Thank you for highly recommending this medicine. I'm grateful for the opportunity to visit Carthage this time and delighted to hear of the lifting of the full closure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the first time in all these years that we've had a drug that surpassed the effectiveness of antibiotics. Your persistence in administering the drug to Mr. Woods earlier allowed us to witness its miraculous impact in combating this virus, prompting deep reflection on my part. Newly developed drugs should indeed not be ostracized," Oliver said sincerely. He then shared his intention to document the epidemic battle in Carthage and truthfully report the drug's achievements to his superiors, advocating for its wider promotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver and I were engrossed in our conversation when suddenly, there was a knock on the door. David entered and said to Oliver, "Dr. Muller, there's a gentleman outside requesting to see you. He insists on meeting someone here and claims to be the president of Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>President of Bryant Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What prompted his sudden visit to Carthage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback for a moment. Oliver, upon hearing this, immediately asked David to invite Elliott in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott walked into Oliver's office, I caught the familiar faint smell of men's perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing back in surprise, I spotted him at the doorway, dressed in a dark blue suit, looking a bit weary, with Barry following closely behind in a black suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was stunned to see me and then gave a rare smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of greeting Oliver, Elliott ran straight to me and directly embraced me into his arms before I could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you alright? What are you doing in Carthage? I hurried here upon learning that you were being held in Carthage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if there had never been any conflict between us, Elliott's words betrayed his concern and intimacy for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, rather than feeling touched, I experienced a strong pang of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily pushed Elliott away, ensuring a safe distance between us. I said, "Mr. Bryant, thank you for your concern. I'm fine. You should be here for Dr. Muller. Enjoy your talk. I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no desire to engage further with Elliott, I made a polite reply before swiftly circumventing him and making a beeline for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, what brings you here? Have a seat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Behind me, Oliver greeted Elliott with enthusiasm.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't turn around and left Oliver's office incredibly quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I returned to Quinn's ward, Carole was not there. Despite his ongoing recovery, Quinn couldn't wait to show off his newfound strength by performing push-ups against a wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's desperate behavior urged me to rush forward and stop him.&#8203;</span></p></div>
