        <h1>Chapter 102 Cooperation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to just notice that Paige was also here. He let go of my hand and looked at Paige, smiling at her in a rare way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, thanks to you for saving the day today. Just settle the expenses with our Purchasing Department, and whatever price you quote will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, this time I was purely helping out my good friend, as long as I don't incur any losses. However, can you consider me for future flower collaborations with Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also stood up, as a businesswoman, she certainly wouldn't miss such a good opportunity to fight for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Elliott was about to say something, a person rushed into the caf&eacute; in a fluster and ran straight up to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Due to some unexpected circumstances, I couldn't make it to this reception."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood in front of Elliott with her head down, apologizing repeatedly and feeling helpless, like a child who had made a big mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a closer look at her and saw that she was wearing a loose white shirt, with a striped tank top underneath and a pair of denim shorts. She had on white sneakers and her hair was tied up in a high ponytail, but it looked slightly messy. Her makeup was also smudged, and she looked disheveled, as if she had just rushed back from somewhere after having gone out to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on my previous judgment of Giselle, she should have highly cherished this rare opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In theory, such a mistake should not have happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly happened to her that led to this situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that even the heavens were helping me this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling puzzled in my heart, and at that moment, Elliott spoke with a chilling tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you go? You should know what this reception meant for the Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle gathered up her courage and lifted her head, her teary eyes gazing at Elliott with a touch of guilt in her gaze, making it impossible for anyone to resist feeling pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I'm really sorry, Elliott. I had actually started preparing last night, but my boyfriend suddenly called and told me he was in Louis City and feeling unwell. I rushed over there overnight, only to find out that he had lied to me. He wasn't sick at all, and he even locked me up and confiscated my phone. It was a struggle for me to finally make it back, but... but it was too late, I'm really sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Giselle finished speaking, she couldn't help but burst into tears, as if she had been greatly wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Rowan deceive her? Did he also confine her? Did he take away her phone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this not very likely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan studied law, and even if he didn't study law, based on his personality, he should have always accommodated Giselle and appeased her. How could he possibly do such a thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought this was not quite normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle cried miserably and pitifully, just like a butterfly drenched in a heavy rain, trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw her like this and felt a twinge of sympathy. He patted her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, luckily my wife came to the rescue in time with the help of friends, so nothing serious happened. Did your boyfriend harm you? Why did he lock you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Elliott really so forgiving of her, that he forgave her just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why he treated me like this either. He said it was because he was afraid of losing me. I'm really sorry, Elliott. I promise that there won't be such things happening again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle held back her tears as she looked at Elliott, resembling an innocent wounded deer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should focus on doing your job well in the Planning Department first. I have instructed Amy to give you more opportunities for experience. As for the flower cooperation, I have someone more suitable in mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not blame her, but given his character, whenever there were any mistakes made by a business partner, there was generally no possibility of further collaboration, and no one was an exception.</span></p></div>
