        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next afternoon I got a call from Elliott, he asked if I was ready and he was coming over to pick me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I went downstairs, he was already waiting for me downstairs at the office in his limited edition sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather is getting warmer, Elliott who has always been fond of black, white and gray shirts changed into a burgundy shirt with a pair of khaki suit nine</span><span>-</span><span>minute pants, he wore sunglasses, from a distance like an international male model from the runway down, his figure with the silver</span><span>-</span><span>gray sports car behind him is indeed very handsome, and it looks like he's much younger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked closer to look at him, he has a kind of like a different person's sense of vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed lightly, </span><span>"</span><span>Yo, why are you dressed so young today?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had one hand in his pocket as he gentlemanly opened the door of the sports car for me, the door opened like a wing and I got in and he got in the driver's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced down at this brand new burgundy shirt he was wearing:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I guess you forgot, you bought this before and put it in your closet, but I just never wore it back then because the color was too conspicuous. Last night I was looking for clothes to turn out to try, I did not expect your eyes quite good, this shirt is very suitable for me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze slightly, and my fuzzy memories restarted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely recalled, the impression that there is indeed such a thing, this shirt I remember </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>from a </span><span>big brand's limited edition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I was never willing to buy things for myself, but I never felt bad about buying things for Elliott, as long as I think it's suitable for him, even if the price is very expensive, I will definitely buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just that he used to hate the things I bought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's obviously an outdated style from years ago, and he's wearing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I always have a good eye, it's you who didn't like it before!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sized him up, realizing that the burgundy shirt complimented his skin tone, especially with the Rolls</span><span>-</span><span>Royce orange interior, making him look young and elegant, and I couldn't help but be proud of my own former vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I was wrong. From now on, how about I leave all my closet in your hands and I'll wear whatever you buy?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled a big smile as he looked at me, his eyes full of favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's too late, I'm not the same little woman who used to surround you every day. The market capitalization of our Glory Group is nowhere near your Bryant Group, but it's not bad as far as the entire business district of Hoswich city is concerned. I'm very busy everyday, how would I have time to help you pick out clothes.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately said arrogantly, my heart was filled with the sour feeling of defeating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Right, Madeline is the beautiful president now, how would she have time. How about this, how about I serve you instead, and I'll take care of your closet, how about that?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly magically carried out a big gift bag from the back seat of the car and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I looked at the packaging of this big gift bag, I knew that what was placed inside was a very expensive international brand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of a woman's strong curiosity, I subconsciously opened the gift bag, and found that there is a summer of the latest models of a big brand runway models long skirt, and a pair of shoes and a jewelry box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the jewelry box and found that inside was a flowing diamond necklace with a pendant in the shape of a key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but exclaim:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, why did you spend so much money?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw the fondness in my eyes, and he instantly hooked his lips and smiled:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I went to Paris a while ago to watch the show live, and at that time I thought this set suited you, so I bought it straight back home, I just never had the time to give it to you. Let's go, it's still early, I'll take you to try it on.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ah? Where to try?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit surprised and astonished, and asked in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he deliberately said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You'll know when we get there.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finished, and he drove me straight down the avenue in his sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never been so flamboyant before, and even though he had a number of sports cars parked in his underground garage, he rarely drove them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he seemed to have opened himself up, not only did he personally drive the sports car and take me flying down the avenue, but also, he directly opened the roof of the sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt that he and I together became an extremely conspicuous landscape on this street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid that being too high</span><span>-</span><span>profile would attract the attention of the crowd, so I panicked and said to Elliott:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, you'd better put down the roof of the car, will this be too conspicuous?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I just want the world to know that you are my woman and no man can covet you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't care, his tone of voice was overbearing, just like the ancient general who forcibly captured his beloved woman on a horse and ran wildly through the grassland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The green light turned red, and the car could only be forced to stop at the edge of the crosswalk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, who was once afraid of his love being known, took my hand, knowing that countless pedestrians were watching us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hand had an electrifying sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I twisted my head in a daze to look at him, and he happened to look at me as well, and we looked at each other, both of us smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't given me such a sense of security in the past, even in his last life his love for Giselle hadn't been so overt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I felt that he was far more attentive and valued me than he had been Giselle in the last life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't realize that I still had memories of my previous life in my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aren't you afraid someone will catch us on camera if you're so flamboyant?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What does it matter if we are photographed. I can't let you have another choice, you can only be mine, you know?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's really so over the top</span><span>-</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he drove a convertible, he even took advantage of the gap between waiting for the stoplight and suddenly pinched my chin, after which, he came up and directly kissed me on the lips!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was unprepared, in an instant there was a sense of vertigo, my breathing seemed to stop for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed his tongue against my lips and teeth to embrace me with abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott</span><span>......</span><span> well</span><span>......</span><span>so many people are watching</span><span> us</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously struggled, slapping his chest and crying out in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he sucked my lips wantonly with more dominant kissing techniques, not letting me think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised and only felt an electric tingling sensation spread throughout my body, I closed my eyes and time and space seemed to stand still, I didn't dare to move.</span></p></div>
