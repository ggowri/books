        <h1>Chapter 203 They Went Shopping Together</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, this was the first time Elliott and I were alone together in an unfamiliar city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I checked the map on my phone and found a large supermarket just two kilometers away. Elliott then suggested we walk there instead of driving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought it was a good idea, so after we left the apartment, we started walking toward the supermarket together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen Elliott in such a casual setting. Although we were married, he mostly maintained a formal, aloof demeanor in a suit and tie, making his presence beside me now feel almost surreal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louis City was a vibrant old city, and we strolled along the sidewalk while the pedestrians also casually walked beside us. Elliott and I moved through the crowd side by side, and he occasionally looked back to make sure I was keeping up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This relaxed and leisurely feeling was something I had never experienced before. For a moment, my mood lightened, and I felt incredibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We then soon reached the entrance of the supermarket and walked in together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled out the shopping list I had prepared earlier, and we started picking up some essential household items before moving on to the food section.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For convenience, I chose some pre-packaged, ready-to-cook ingredients and then picked up some fruits while Elliott followed silently behind me. He watched as I made my selections, and we occasionally discussed our choices. We were just like a couple who had been together for years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I had selected the groceries and household items, Elliott accompanied me to the checkout area.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The line at the checkout was long, and fearing that I might get jostled by the crowd, he wrapped his arms around me, protecting me with his broad chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I leaned against Elliott's chest, his familiar scent enveloped me, bringing a sense of peace I hadn't felt before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but look up at him and saw that he was intently watching the queue ahead. After seeing Elliott's enticing Adam's apple, his tightly pressed lips, and his prominent nose, my heart fluttered uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, we were like an intimate couple. We didn't need to speak much to feel deeply connected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mused, "If only this feeling could last forever. How wonderful that would be..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then couldn't resist taking my phone out and snapping a photo of us from the side. I didn't capture our faces. I just wanted to preserve this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The queue was still long, so I casually browsed my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, I saw that Giselle had posted on Instagram.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had uploaded a photo of herself in a spaghetti strap dress, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling window looking at the night sky on Instagram. Her long hair cascaded over her shoulders, and the dim background made her skin appear even more smooth and delicate. Giselle's side profile was stunningly beautiful as if she were a sprite of the night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caption beneath the photo reads: [Missing you is a pain that breathes.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered, "Who is Giselle missing? Could it be she's thinking of the man beside me?"</span></p></div>
