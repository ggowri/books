        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think so. On the contrary, I feel that Madeline has changed a lot. There are plenty of other options out there. Why give up the whole forest for Elliott? Madeline doesn't care about what he thinks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige held my hand and spoke for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right... I have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have suffered so much and tasted so much indifference and despair that Elliott brought to me. If I still had feelings for him, then I was truly beyond redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the three of them sent me back to my parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents were still awake, waiting for me to come home. When they saw me being brought back by them, they both had worried expressions on their faces. They lost all sleepiness and kept asking me where I had been tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I have some good news and some bad news to tell you. Which one do you want to hear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching them leave, my parents and I sat on the sofa. Shortly after, I said to my dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to hear both of them. Go ahead," my father asked with a slightly solemn expression. His eyes were full of concern for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The good news is that last night I spent six million dollars to acquire the copyright of 'Do Not Love'. Although the price was slightly higher than we expected, trust me, I will definitely make this TV series a success."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My father already knew the financial transfer that I arranged. Therefore, he was not surprised, and he asked me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about the bad news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bad news is, when I came back from the restaurant tonight, I was kidnapped and almost got into trouble. If it weren't for a few friends of mine who arrived in time to rescue me, my incident would probably have appeared as a headline in major media tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could this happen?" My dad jumped up from the sofa in shock when he heard me say that. "Has the person who kidnapped you been caught? I want to personally ask them who ordered them to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad has always been very emotional, and on top of that, he grew up with Uncle Tom. Although they were not blood brothers, he has always treated Tom as his own brother. Therefore, he also had a special affection for Jade and trusted her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, it was precisely because of this that my family ended up losing everything and perishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I need to say something that you might not like to hear. Do you believe that someone wants to harm us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked straight into my father's eyes and said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? Madeline, do you know something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was even more stunned upon hearing me say this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just started working at Glory Group today, and such an accident happened to me in the evening. Don't you find it strange? Moreover, I have heard before that everyone at Glory Group has always mistaken Jade as your biological daughter. She now holds a lot of power in Glory Group, while Uncle Tom is in charge of the logistics of Glory Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you suggesting that Jade and Tom have bad intentions?" My dad immediately guessed what I wanted to say, but he firmly shook his head. "No way, Tom is very honest. He doesn't have any ulterior motives. Jade is also a good kid. She has always been hardworking in her job. Madeline, you're definitely overthinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had expected my dad would react this way. After all, he had always trusted Tom and Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, but I heard with my own ears that they said they were going to find a way to harm me. And then I had this accident. I know you value family, but it's hard to see through a person. There are many things we should be cautious about so that we don't regret it when someone takes advantage of us in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that it would take a long time to convince my dad, but I had to remind him first so that he wouldn't be caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think Madeline was right. It's hard to see through a person, so it's better to be cautious about many things. Honey, you should be more careful in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother agreed with me and said so. For a moment, my father fell into deep thought. He turned around with his hands behind his back and walked heavily towards the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that his caution had already awakened. However, he still needed time to slowly accept this fact.</span></p></div>
