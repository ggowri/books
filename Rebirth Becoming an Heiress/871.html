        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intimate gesture I just shared with Elliott, which in my perspective was merely aiding his recovery, was nothing short of a bombshell in Quinn's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I simply stashed my phone in the drawer and headed off to the meeting room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, when I returned to the office, I found three missed calls on my phone. One was from Elliott, and the other two were from Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, noticing I hadn't picked up his call, shot me a text:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, have you made up your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I knew what he was implying. He must've thought I was planning to get back together with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's meet and talk. I'll treat you to dinner tonight. See you in thirty minutes at the revolving restaurant across from my office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt it necessary to clear the air with Quinn, so I took the initiative to set up a meeting with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shot back a response in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed my bag and headed straight to the revolving restaurant across the street, snagging a seat for myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Quinn showed up, casually dressed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weather warmed, he was clad in a thin white tee paired with khaki casual trousers. On his feet were a pair of laid-back sneakers, giving off a youthful and sunny vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, he managed to squeeze out a hint of a smile, taking a seat across from me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to explain when he took my hand, whispering softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for words, I get it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you don't get it," I shook my head, saying, "Quinn, you must think I did that because he moved me, wanting to get back together with him, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Quinn shook his head resolutely, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never considered it that way. Because I know, it's impossible. You and your family love Noah so much, there's no way you'd get back together with him. Because if you did, they'd definitely insist on bringing Noah back to the Bryant family. So, I'm not worried about you changing your mind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly gets me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he saw me sitting so close to Elliott with his own eyes, he still understood what was truly going on in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized my explanation was utterly unnecessary, so, with a sense of relief, I simply smiled and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a relief. I was worried you'd be upset."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm upset. In my heart, you're already mine. But I understand, you don't want to owe him anything. You're just helping him recover now. But Madeline, can you promise me, try to avoid these intimate gestures with him in the future?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took my hand, gazing at me with earnest words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To aid in Elliott's recovery, I can't afford to be distant. Only by convincing him that we're still married, can we expedite his healing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I can't bear to break Quinn's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll try to avoid being alone with him as much as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded quickly, blurting out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that you're meeting me today shows that you still care about me. In the past, whether you got back together with him or not, I didn't really mind, because all I wanted was for you to be happy. But now, I can't do that anymore. Madeline, I want to be the one to give you happiness for the rest of your life. Do you understand what I'm saying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, typically mild-mannered, suddenly became domineering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words, he abruptly pulled out an exquisite jewelry box from his pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden move took me by surprise...</span></p></div>
