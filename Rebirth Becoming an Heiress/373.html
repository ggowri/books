        <h1>Chapter 373 DNA Appraisal</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle replied soon, [Of course, Elliott's the father. I wouldn't dare deceive the entire Bryant family. Madeline, give up and divorce Elliott. Consider it a blessing for my child and yourself.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arrogance threatened to shatter my already fragile mental defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I stared at the DNA report, a myriad of emotions surged within me, each one more agonizing than the last.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if every fiber of my being was being stabbed with needles, from my internal organs to the surface of my skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was unbearable, and I was overcome with a nauseating sensation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned over the trash can, retching violently, but my empty stomach offered no relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my misery of vomiting, Fiona and Paige returned with takeout food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concerned, Fiona rushed to my side, attempting to soothe me as I struggled to control my heaving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still vomiting? You haven't eaten anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige offered me a cupcake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We bought your favorite cupcakes, Madeline. Eat something, your stomach will feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige opened the takeaway box. However, the mere scent of them intensified my nausea, prompting me to push them away frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, take it away quickly, I feel worse when I smell it. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige noticed my discomfort and quickly closed the lid of the cupcakes, placing them out of sight on the cabinet across the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, my stomach settled, and I weakly reclined on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked me with concern, "Look at you, you were already skinny to your bone. you need to get rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shook her head as well, looking at me with a mixture of distress and compassion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suffering like this? I told you to stay away from a man like Elliott. Your reaction is so severe, it reminds me of when I was pregnant," she remarked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly intervened, urging Paige not to worsen the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not dwell on the past now. Madeline needs to take her mind away from those people and what they have done."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said gently, pulling me into her embrace. She comforted me with soothing words, encouraging me to rest and take time to think about what to do next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, listen to me, don't think about it now. Just take a break in the next two days and calmly think about what to do next. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had happened has happened, what should be done in the future was the most significant thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking her advice to heart, I closed my eyes, but my mind involuntarily drifted to memories with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could a man who had seemingly changed his mind truly be sincere?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never felt like hiding his dislike of a person. If he had feelings for Giselle, he wouldn't have treated me so nicely while ignoring her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of Giselle taunting me echoed in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her true nature surfaced at Alexis's law firm, she exuded an aura of clandestine scheming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she had been biding her time for three long months, concealing the impending drama of her pregnancy. Now, with the deliberate flaunting of the DNA results and the photo, I felt ensnared in Giselle's twisted game.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott and I were to divorce, it would align perfectly with Giselle's machinations. This outcome appeared to be her ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this realization settled in, I opened my eyes and turn to Fiona with a question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, can a woman conduct a DNA appraisal on her unborn child during pregnancy?"</span></p></div>
