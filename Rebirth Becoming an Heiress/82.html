        <h1>Chapter 82 Disappointed Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, were you deliberately trying to annoy me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally spat out the melon and glanced at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Didn't you say before that we could never be together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged my shoulders and put on an innocent look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe that I have now lowered my posture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice became low again. He lay down, opened his eyes, and silently gazed at the moon in the sky, appearing particularly indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Is this what they call lowering oneself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I didn't feel it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If in the previous life I had not witnessed with my own eyes the kind of madness he had for Giselle, perhaps, if he has reached this point now, I would truly fall in love with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I have witnessed firsthand his craziness for love in the past, and compared to what he is doing for me now, I don't feel moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he used to not see me as a person before, but now he finally sees me as half a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Red velvet cake was really delicious. Won't you give it a try? When I was a child, my favorite thing was sitting on the rooftop with my parents, eating red velvet cake and admiring the moon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shifted the topic again, I really didn't want to ruin the harmonious atmosphere tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind tonight was particularly comfortable, everything was just right, and what's more, today was Thanksgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face became even more gloomy, and he stood up and walked to the front railing, the wind carrying his low voice over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandfather's health was getting worse and worse. He hoped that before he passed away, we could have a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, I also felt a bit sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's grandfather, who was already ninety years old, had been living in his hometown since his retirement, with someone specifically responsible for taking care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only saw him on the day he got married to Elliott. He was in high spirits at that time, wearing a black suit, and he seemed very happy to see me and Elliott getting married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard that Elliott was raised by his grandparents, and he had a deep bond with his grandfather and grandmother. Unfortunately, his grandmother passed away due to illness before I married him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "No wonder he suddenly treated me so well, it turns out it was because of his grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was confused before, but now I finally understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to wonder how Elliott suddenly changed his attitude towards me. It's unrealistic for someone who didn't like you from the beginning to suddenly change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The small flame that was burning in my heart was instantly extinguished by a splash of cold water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, Elliott's phone, which was placed aside, rang. I glanced at it and saw that it was a text message from Giselle. I was instantly extremely disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The text message only displayed a small portion, but from this small snippet of text, I already have a general idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, thank you for the gift you gave me. I was very happy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Elliott really cares about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We have been together for so long, and he has never given me any gifts. But he has already carefully prepared a gift for Giselle, even though they have only known each other for a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very frustrated, and in an instant, I suddenly felt that the moonlight had also become desolate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hasn't Giselle already been discharged from the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually asked, once again avoiding the topic of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, she just left the hospital yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to look at me. At that moment, he was bathed in moonlight, appearing somewhat holy. His every gesture and movement still resembled that of a high and mighty prince, making one unable to resist the urge to prostrate oneself at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, she just seemed to have sent you a message. Don't you take a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows at him, indicating him to look at the phone.</span></p></div>
