        <h1>Chapter 276 Past Events</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight years ago, I waited in the rain for a whole seven hours to catch a glimpse of his car passing by on that road.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven years ago, I fought tooth and nail to get into the university where he studied, pretending to coincidentally be on the path he always took one time after another. Yet all I could do was watch him walk past me arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six years ago, upon hearing that he was ill, I skipped class and sneaked into the hospital, disguising myself as a nurse. I silently took his temperature, applied cold towels, and stayed by his side all night until his fever subsided.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, when he went abroad to study, I went to the airport and watched tearfully as his plane took off while my tears fell uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four years ago, all the young socialites of Hoswich City knew of my love for Elliott. Yet Elliott never once looked at me in the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years ago, I summoned all my courage to make him aware of my identity and my feelings for him. Finally, I seized the opportunity, relying on the two billion dollars from my family to become his wife. However, after the wedding, he disappeared for a whole night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two years ago, I did everything in my power to become his ideal girl, but each time, I made a fool of myself in front of him. As a result, I was ridiculed and mocked by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One year ago, I almost drove myself insane trying to conceive his child, using every method possible. Yet no matter what I did, all I received from him was indifference and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of the above didn't even include the experiences of my past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of the past resurfaced like shattered dreams under the melody of this song. The sadness and boundless affection contained in the music made tears stream down my face unconsciously, leaving me numb and paralyzed in my chair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether I admitted it or not, Elliott was in all the memories of my youthful years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much I forced myself to let go, but deep down, that lingering sense of unwillingness to do so felt like a rope tightening around my throat, one I couldn't undo or break free from.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The performance on stage ended with a final note on the piano.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat in the audience. Beneath my mask, my face was soaked with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a huge, exquisite cake was suddenly pushed onto the stage by a waiter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, Mr. S, like a magician, took out a large bouquet of roses from beside the piano and walked towards the audience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone realized what he was about to do and made way for him. At the same time, all the girls in the audience started screaming. After all, no one knew who was the main character of tonight's party.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained immersed in my thoughts of the past with little expectation. After all, such surprises had never happened to me before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced Elliott's indifference and cruelty over the years, I no longer harbored any expectations in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to my astonishment, I suddenly saw the bouquet of roses appear before me. The girls sitting beside me couldn't help but scream when they saw it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head in astonishment, only to see Mr. S standing right in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though we were both wearing masks, his gaze was so focused on me. He looked at me and said in a deep voice, "Happy birthday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Birthday?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was my birthday?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly dawned on me that today was indeed my birthday. Just a few days ago, my mom mentioned that my birthday was coming up, but I had been so busy lately that I completely forgot about it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely dumbfounded. The enormity of this surprise left me at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me hesitate to take the bouquet, Mr. S simply stuffed it into my hands. Then, right in front of everyone, he lifted me up by the waist and carried me back to the stage, bringing me to the exquisite cake that was brought up to the stage earlier.</span></p></div>
