        <h1>Chapter 469 Emergency Room</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled forcefully to free myself from his grasp. Seeing him so weak, I felt deeply sorry for him. But ultimately, I forced myself to be firm and without a word, I squeezed out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to leave, I was utterly surprised to hear Barry's alarmed cry from behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned in astonishment, only to see Elliott emerging from the car. Moreover, he recklessly tore off the needle from his hand, and before I could react, he forcefully grabbed me by the neck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I realized what was happening, he had dragged me into the car with brute force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly ordered Barry to close the door, without even asking if I agreed, and immediately commanded the driver to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified by Elliott's actions and instinctively struggled intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I heard him gasping heavily in my ear. The place where the needle had pierced his hand was now bleeding profusely. He had pulled it out too forcefully, causing blood to stain his entire hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was dumbfounded, suddenly unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very close to me, his body scorching hot. Just as I was about to say something, he suddenly tilted his head, seemingly unable to hold himself up any longer, and his head heavily leaned on my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled and called out his name in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! Elliott!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't respond. Suddenly, he seemed to have a seizure, with his eyelids fluttering and a sudden change in his condition, leaving me in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, something's seriously wrong with him! Hurry! Tell the driver to go faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the gravity of the situation, I immediately shouted at Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nodded hurriedly and instructed the driver to speed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car raced like an arrow on the road, and soon, it rushed through the gates of Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the car stopped, a group of doctors and nurses who had been waiting rushed over, scrambling to carry Elliott out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry and I followed them all the way to the door of the emergency room, where the clock on the wall kept ticking. I paced anxiously outside the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about half an hour, Elliott's high fever finally subsided, and the doctors moved him to a regular ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott slowly opened his eyes again and saw me sitting by his bedside. Despite his obvious weakness, he grabbed my hand like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared that I would leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially wanted to stay cold-hearted and ignore him. After all, we were about to get divorced, so it was pointless to put on a show of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But looking at his pale face, the bruises and bloodstains on his hand, and his fearful expression of me leaving, I couldn't bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant has been running a high fever for two days. He has been repeatedly calling out your name. As soon as the fever subsided, he insisted on finding you. The doctor said Mr. Bryant's fever has lasted too long, and his consciousness is not clear. He's like a child now, just wanting to find the person he relies on the most. Mrs. Bryant, please stay with Mr. Bryant for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, who usually spoke little, said a lot at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned as I looked at Barry. Eventually, I nodded, sitting down and allowing Elliott to hold my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he lay pale on the hospital bed, occasionally opening his eyelids. After confirming that I was by his side, he closed them again. His deeply dependent appearance was truly like that of a child afraid of his mom leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was a child and had a high fever, there were times when I deeply relied on my mom. I could understand his feelings now, so I decided to stay until his fever subsided before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I convinced myself, to my surprise, Laura's extremely anxious voice came from the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! Is Elliott okay? Elliott! I'm here!"</span></p></div>
