        <h1>Chapter 118 Excellence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, when was I ever stingy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott felt so unjustly treated in front of his own mother that he seemed like a child, but he didn't know how to argue back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone said this about him, he would have been angry long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About whether you are stingy or not, I don't believe your words, I believe your wife's words. Madeline, is he good to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura pulled my hand and asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was very kind to me. The dress I wore to the last dinner was specifically tailored for me by him. Actually, I didn't feel the need for it. Although we have a lot of wealth, we still need to save a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately took the opportunity to praise Elliott, while also expressing my own diligence and frugality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the elders love to hear such words. Hearing me say this, Laura felt even more relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, listen to what she's saying. You used to always say in front of me that Madeline was not considerate. In my opinion, she is much more considerate than those women who only know how to spend your money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's attitude towards me has completely reversed now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And hearing her say that, I was also very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, no one is unaware of how to perform. However, people need to be praised and recognized in order to become better and better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you did well, but no one thought you did, everyone targeted you, and no matter what you did, you couldn't become excellent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing betrayal in the previous life, this kind of tranquility is truly rare for me today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants quickly brought the dishes to the table one by one, and our family sat around the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and Laura were very concerned about their health, so the overall dishes were relatively light and nourishing, and the ingredients were all natural, mostly poultry or vegetables raised by Laura herself in the backyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott accompanied Jasper for a drink, while I, under Laura's insistence, had a lot of nourishing soup. Laura always thought I was too thin and wanted me to gain some weight. I felt helpless, but since I rarely ate with them, I tried to comply with their wishes and no longer felt uncomfortable and argued like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the meal, Jasper suddenly asked me what I was doing at Glory Group now. When he found out that I was working on a television drama, Jasper didn't say much, just nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "We don't oppose you returning to work at your father's company. After all, you are the only daughter in your family. However, after a woman gets married, she should prioritize her husband. You shouldn't overwork yourself. At this stage, the most important thing for you both is to conceive a child as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, only Laura urged us to have children. I didn't expect that Jasper would start now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Jasper. Elliott and I had a plan. You can trust us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I obediently said, looking like a well-behaved and understanding person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Jasper nodded and didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been with the Bryant family for two years. Only today's meal made me feel like I have a home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past life, I was always confused, not knowing what I should do to please them and fit into this family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in this lifetime, I discovered that everything is best left to nature. When I became my most authentic self, surprisingly, everything went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling emotional in my heart. However, just at that moment, the butler Goree suddenly hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered to Jasper and Laura, "Mr. Jasper Bryant, Mrs. Laura Bryant, Baxter Cole's wife and daughter are here to visit today, they are outside the door now. Should I let them in now, or should I ask them to wait in the parlor for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baxter?"</span></p></div>
