        <h1>Chapter 591 Mixed Emotions</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott heard her words, he finally lowered his head to take a closer look. When Elliott saw the pool of amniotic fluid between her legs, Elliott was immediately flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? Quickly call an ambulance and get her to the hospital!" I finally snapped out of my daze, shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I swiftly pulled out my phone and dialed 911.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to realize the urgency of the situation. He immediately stepped forward to support Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you... okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, it hurts so much, really hurts, I... I can't stand anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle weakly collapsed into Elliott's arms, her legs trembling uncontrollably, sweat dampening her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't seem like an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had already lifted Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we rushed out of the office door, Elliott glanced at me with guilt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, faced with a life-threatening situation, he didn't hesitate. Elliott rushed into the VIP elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I reached the ground floor, Giselle had already been pushed onto the ambulance by doctors and nurses, with Elliott following suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood quietly in place, watching my former husband, who was now guarding a woman about to give birth to his child, feeling a mix of indescribable emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambulance doors closed quickly. Elliott gave me a look full of guilt, but I didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned away, pretending not to care, and left the scene in one breath, then got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambulance sped away, leaving me with a whirlwind of complex emotions. I complained in our group chat with my two best friends: [You can't imagine what I just went through. Giselle is giving birth today.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly replied: [What? Isn't it before her due date?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I replied promptly: [She was stressed into premature labor, such a turbulent fate for this child...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona responded with a series of ellipses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paige suddenly sent a message: [Damn it, forget about her, I'm about to be stressed into premature labor too!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige's message, I felt worried and quickly asked: [What's wrong?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige promptly sent an angry emoji: [That jerk, Philip! He's been disappearing lately, and I seriously suspect he's cheating!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's words instantly brought back memories of everything I had seen on the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Paige's words, I guessed she still didn't know the full extent of the situation and was just feeling something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Should I tell Paige the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was at a loss for what to do when Fiona sent another message: [Damn it, that wretched woman has been brought to our hospital! Not only did she go into premature labor, but she also lost a lot of blood! I'm heading to the operating room to help out!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I suddenly heard how serious things had become, a foreboding feeling enveloped my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Paige, seemingly enjoying the drama, tagged me, saying: [Madeline, my stomach feels a bit off too. Come pick me up! Take me to the hospital for a check-up!]</span></p></div>
