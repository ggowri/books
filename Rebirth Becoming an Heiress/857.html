        <h1>Chapter 857: The Security Guard Shows Up to Evict</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Laura finished speaking, she suddenly took my hand affectionately, saying gently:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know I messed up in the past. I hurt you, and I caused your divorce with Elliott. But back then, I was deceived by that wench, Giselle. And Cormac was so eager to see Elliott's child, I felt cornered. Can you forgive me? I promise to treat you right from now on. When I pass away, all my treasured jewels will be yours, as a form of reparation. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've seen Laura's collection of jewels. There were pieces from her dowry, and others her husband bought for her during the heyday of the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closet was half-filled with auction items of immeasurable value.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, what happens after she passes away?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I burst into laughter instantly. I'm not the naive girl from years ago who blindly believed her empty promises.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all in the past now, there's no need for you to say these things. I don't want your jewelry either. Please, leave now, you're scaring my parents."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly, utterly unmoved by her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my unwavering stance, her voice immediately took on a sharp edge:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, all I want is a glimpse of that child. The fact that you're barring me like this only proves that the kid is Elliott's. Why else would you be so on edge? If you don't let me in today, I swear I'll camp out here until you do!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to hold her in high regard, considering she was, after all, from a prestigious family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she's completely torn off all pretenses, acting like a shrew, and honestly, it's really off-putting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I pulled out my phone and dialed up the management office:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there! Some folks have trespassed into my property and are refusing to leave my doorstep. Could you send over a few security guards to shoo them away, please?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura incredulously asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, no matter what, I was once your mother-in-law. How could you have the security escort me out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said it yourself, it's all in the 'past'. We have no connection now. You decide, either leave on your own or wait for security to escort you out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, my voice icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura glanced around nervously, but then, thinking of her two bodyguards, she spoke with unexpected resolve:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not leaving. There's no way I'm going anywhere until I see my child today!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you trying to drive away, Ms. Mayers?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the security chief, flanked by a team of guards, appeared at my doorstep. Upon seeing me, he immediately questioned me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pointed at Laura, and with that, the security chief, followed by his team, moved in to clear the area.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Laura immediately snapped at the bodyguard she brought along:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? What do you think I brought you here for? Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards were initially taken aback. But at her shout, they had no choice but to engage in a brawl with a few security guards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a business van pulled up right outside my house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that, a crisp feminine voice echoed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we're here to see the kiddo!"</span></p></div>
