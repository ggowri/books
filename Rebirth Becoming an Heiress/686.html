        <h1>Chapter 686 Reveal the Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn directly stuffed food into my mouth, while at the same time, he signaled me with his eyes not to speak the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong, Madeline? What do you want to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's hand came around from under the table at this moment, gently squeezing my palm. He repeatedly signaled me with his eyes, urging me not to speak the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I certainly understood his intention. He hoped that this matter would only be a secret between him and me, never to be told to anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I understand that the truth will come to light sooner or later. If I don't speak up now and wait until the child is born in the future, and their family has invested all their emotions, only to discover that it was a deception, then I would truly be betraying my conscience. Then, Giselle and I would have no difference at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there is such a good girl by Quinn's side. We were not lovers, so why should I delay his lifelong happiness because of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a close friend, even if Quinn is willing to sacrifice for me, I cannot just stand by and watch him do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I mustered up the courage. I cleared my throat and looked at Jessica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica, the child in my belly, actually wasn't Quinn's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden remark stunned everyone, especially Carole. When she heard my words, she was so shocked that she almost sprayed the soup out of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what nonsense are you talking about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that I would still speak the truth, and Quinn immediately pretended to scare me seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I looked at him apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in the face of the questioning gazes from everyone, I calmly said, "Many of you must have heard about my previous involvement with the Bryant family. During this time, I am very grateful to Quinn for always being by my side, accompanying me through this difficult journey in life. I know he did it out of kindness, wanting to protect me and be there for me, but I cannot delay his own life, and I cannot deceive your feelings. This child has no connection with Quinn. In fact, Quinn and I are just friends. I am very grateful for the care and nurturing your family has shown me during this time. I'm sorry, I lied to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finished saying these words in one breath, then stood up and bowed deeply to Quinn's parents to express my apologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing the events of the Bryant family and getting to know Laura, I actually realized that Quinn's parents were very easygoing people. If I could become Quinn's wife, I would have a peaceful and happy life in the later years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had already lost the chance to be with Quinn. I didn't have such luck, so I could only go this far with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden confession caught everyone off guard. I saw Jessica's right hand still raised in mid-air. It was evident that she was genuinely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, is this true? What on earth is going on with you guys? You've completely baffled me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole snapped out of it at this moment. She glanced at me, then at Quinn, and asked incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, speak up. Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheerful sound of Zara's chirping came over, but at this moment, it seemed a bit untimely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's originally friendly face instantly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me deeply, his eyes filled with a strong sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I had already confessed, he had no choice but to say, "It wasn't Madeline's intention to hide this matter, it was me who didn't want you to know. I chose to be with Madeline, so no matter what her situation is, I accept it and I will treat the child as my own. Dad, Mom, please don't blame Madeline. This has nothing to do with her."</span></p></div>
