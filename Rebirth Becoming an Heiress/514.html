        <h1>Chapter 514 He's Not Important</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also embarrassed, but he still moved his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head, trying hard not to overthink, focusing solely on the knot on his pants. It took me quite an effort, but I finally managed to untie that stubborn knot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was probably at his breaking point. He didn't even care about anything at that moment, immediately pulling his pants down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily averted my gaze elsewhere and heard the sound of water flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even though I didn't turn my head and clearly didn't see anything, I felt my face burning up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each second seemed to stretch out endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We both held our breath, neither of us speaking, making the sound of the water even more abrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Quinn took a deep breath and said, "I am done. Could you please help me fasten my belt again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," I replied softly, turning my red face away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dared not look into Quinn's eyes and just kept my head down, focusing on fastening his belt again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait a moment. I need to use the restroom!" Adam's voice came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard Adam was about to come in, I was startled, feeling completely at a loss, and accidentally knotted Quinn's belt again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Adam rushed in, clearly not expecting Quinn and me to be in the men's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but exclaim, "Oh, sorry, Madeline, I'll just leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly misunderstood. Before Quinn and I could explain, he had already turned and dashed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation couldn't have been more awkward. At that moment, Quinn couldn't hold back his laughter any longer. "This is just too embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter, oddly enough, eased the tension a bit. I lifted my head to see Quinn's face as flushed as mine, and I couldn't help but laugh, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, I'll help you back," I said to Quinn, restraining my amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn nodded, turning laboriously and taking careful steps forward. And so, step by step, I assisted him back to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he had endured a great ordeal, Quinn sighed&nbsp;a long sigh of relief when he lay back on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel much better now. I have toughed it out the whole night. Madeline, I offered to send you to the hotel, but you refused. Now you understand how much of a hassle it is to look after me, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had gradually composed myself. Hearing Quinn's words, I couldn't help but punch his arm. "Don't say such things. If it were anyone else in the hospital, I wouldn't be taking care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my playful punch, he burst into laughter, looking at me with mischievous eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "That's true. Elliott had a fever a few days ago, and you didn't even go to the hospital. It seems he's not as important as I am to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know where he got that information from. I just smiled, "He's fine now. Marcus got him some effective medicine. But now, he's planning to compete with me. Marcus and I just started working together, and he immediately teamed up with Ocean Pharmaceutical to launch a similar drug."</span></p></div>
