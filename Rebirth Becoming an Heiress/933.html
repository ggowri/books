        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline </span><span>No.</span><span>13, please pick up the lab order </span><span>......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when I didn't know how to respond, a voice prompt in Korean suddenly came from the lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my name, we both stood up at the same time, however, when Elliott saw me standing up as well, he panicked and held down my shoulder to make me sit down, and then he went forward to fetch the lab sheet for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We went back to Mike's office with the labs, and Mike looked at the labs, and then he spoke to me in English:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mrs. Bryant, it seems that you have suffered from gout because you ate too much seafood and drank too much alcohol a few days ago, which led to the increase of uric acid in your body, causing gout in your feet. But don't worry, I'll prescribe medicine for you, and after taking the medicine and then resting, it will come down quickly.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mike finished speaking, he quickly prescribed the medicine for me, because of the reason that he was very familiar with Elliott, he also specially arranged a ward with a very good environment, so that I could rest and observe in the ward after taking the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so tired that after I took the medicine, I fell asleep as soon as I lay down on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few times, I felt a cold sensation on my forehead, as if Elliott had wet a towel and put it on my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A couple of times when I opened my eyes in a daze, I could vaguely see him sitting in front of the bed watching me, his eyes filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know if it was the effect of the medication or the fact that I wasn't feeling well, but I slept for a long time, from daytime until nighttime, before I finally felt much more comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I opened my eyes again, I realized that the soles of my feet no longer hurt, the fever on my body had also receded, that feeling of dizziness lessened, and my entire being seemed to have come to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to struggle to get up from the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that my hand had been tightly grasped by Elliott, and Elliott was probably too tired, he directly leaned against the back of the chair by the edge of my bed and fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man who always paid attention to his appearance, he kept a classy look even when he was sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lethargically leaned on the back of the chair, his eyes closed, long eyelashes covering his eyelids, one hand grasping me, the other hand resting on his cheeks to support his entire head, a pair of long legs that had nowhere to rest bent in resignation like a still sculpture, carrying a stunning three</span><span>-</span><span>dimensional beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I merely glanced at him and felt my eyes instantly drawn to him, staring silently at his face for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely surprised that Elliott, who was already asleep, would suddenly open his eyes at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was defenseless, and my just</span><span>-</span><span>intoxicated look was completely seen by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shocked that I subconsciously scrunched my neck, and in the next second, scarlet red quickly crept over my cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're awake?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me in all my embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Uh, awake.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I whispered as I scrambled to avert my gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Are you feeling better, Mike said he prescribed you the best medicine, you should see results soon after you take it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked with concern, his hand still holding mine tightly, only, he slightly adjusted his grip on my hand and his whole body came a little closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Well, I can't feel the pain in the soles of my feet anymore, and my fever has gone down, it's just </span><span>......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Just what?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's </span><span>......</span><span> feeling a little hungry.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I did feel really hungry, after all, I hadn't eaten much this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words and my somewhat embarrassed look caused him to favorably scratch my nose:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I would have guessed you'd be hungry, after all you haven't eaten all day. Come on, I'll take you to eat.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he then yanked me up from the hospital bed before thoughtfully putting on my jacket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That pampered look was truly like a loving father treating his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Weren't you always busy before? This time you accompany me for so many days, what about your company's business?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of the former busy like a gyroscope in general, he asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>All the company things can be pushed back, right now in my eyes, you are the most important.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stepped forward and he rubbed me into his arms and hugged me tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words and the strength of his embrace impress upon me just how much he really values me right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like my heart was melting a little bit like a glacier meeting a warm sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those cold ice that I once thought would not melt, now it is difficult to resist this warm current of his, even though the rationality in my mind is still struggling, however, my heart seems to be slowly leaning towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't say anything, just quietly let him hold me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment of indulgence, because I knew in my heart that I had actually developed a kind of attachment to his embrace again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I couldn't do anything about this feeling in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head couldn't help but follow my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held me for a long time before he let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took my hand and led me out of the hospital room, and we took the elevator down to the clinic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike was actually still in the clinic, it was after eleven o'clock at night and he still hadn't left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how Elliott tried to pass the buck, Mike always insisted on inviting him to dinner, and told us that he deliberately waited here just to get together with Elliott, after all, they hadn't seen each other for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike took us to a very authentic Korean restaurant, ordered a lot of Korean specialties, and specially called his wife to accompany him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike's wife is a South Korean television travel program host, the standard Korean beauty, exquisite makeup, hairstyle clothing are very advanced, beautiful like a porcelain doll in the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as I can remember, this is the first time that I, as Elliott's </span><span>"</span><span>wife</span><span>"</span><span>, accompanied him in such a formal meeting with his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire conversation was in English, and we had a great time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike told me a lot of interesting stories about Elliott's time studying abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that I realized that he had not only acted in the school play, but also worked as a part</span><span>-</span><span>time actor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, in addition to the volunteer work he said he had done before, he had also participated in many emergency rescues with Mike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mike's description made my impression of Elliott no longer the stereotypical image of the past, but once again deeply felt that he is actually a vivid man in private, not just the domineering president in my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meal brought Elliott and I closer together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Mike drove us back to our original hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had checked out earlier, so we would have to get a new room when we returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Elliott was ready to open the room, he encountered a very embarrassing problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This hotel is actually full, there is only one room left, and, it is still a king</span><span>-</span><span>size bed room </span><span>......</span></p></div>
