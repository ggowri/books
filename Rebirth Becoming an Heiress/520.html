        <h1>Chapter 520 Carole Is Here</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I had only glimpsed her from afar last time, I still recognized her. She was Quinn's sister, Carole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole was quite impressive. With Carthage under full lockdown, she still managed to arrive here in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, Quinn is here!" I hurriedly approached and informed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone called out to Carole. She was stunned for a moment before striding over to me, calmly asking, "How is he doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still in a deep sleep, still running a fever," I replied truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole immediately made her way to Quinn's bedside. She firmly slapped his arm without caring whether Quinn was still asleep. "You rascal! We've been frantically looking for you everywhere! Why on earth would you come to this wretched place to suffer? Quinn, get up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Carole's forceful slap, Quinn, despite his discomfort, immediately snapped awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his head, Quinn weakly opened his eyes and glanced at Carole. Clearly in pain, he asked, "Carole, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you to ask me why I'm here! If I hadn't come, everyone at home would have been worried sick! How are you? Can you get up? If you can, we're leaving! Let's get out of this dump!" Carole scolded Quinn again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn mentioned his sister's temper before. It was something hardly anyone could tolerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, seeing her in person, I realized Quinn wasn't exaggerating. Carole's personality was the opposite of her gentle name, and it didn't match her elegant and aloof appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Carthage is under full lockdown, we might not be able to leave," I whispered as I overheard Carole's remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't leave, I'll figure something out. Quinn, sit up and stop acting like a dead person. It's just a fever, nothing serious!" Carole yelled at Quinn again, then rudely grabbed his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was covering himself with the blanket, and Carole probably didn't even notice his injuries. When Carole pulled, Quinn immediately let out a deafening roar, "Carole, don't move! Are you trying to kill me? Damn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was genuinely in pain. His face flushed, which startled Carole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when Carole forcefully pulled back the blanket did she notice Quinn's abdomen wrapped in gauze, with fresh blood seeping through. She became alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're injured? How bad is it? Why didn't you say anything? What happened? Did you get into a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still concerned for her brother, Carole's tone instantly turned anxious upon seeing Quinn's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't that serious before, but just now, when you pulled, you nearly killed me. Okay, okay, you can go back now. I won't die in a while. You don't have to worry about me," Quinn grumbled, then shrugged off Carole's hand, urging her to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you say that! I went through all sorts of trouble to look for you and walked miles through the mountains to bypass the checkpoints just to get to this dump. And now you're chasing me away? Do you know I barely ate anything for the past two days worrying about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole was furious. She grabbed Quinn's ear and scolded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Carole's shoes instinctively. Now I understood why there was mud on her boots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Carole, take it easy. Quinn didn't mean to keep you in the dark. His phone got broken, so he couldn't reach out. Why don't you have a seat first? Dr. Thomas and Dr. Muller are right here. They can fill you in on what's been happening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carole and Quinn arguing, I quickly intervened to calm Carole down.</span></p></div>
