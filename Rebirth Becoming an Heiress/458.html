        <h1>Chapter 458 Won</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that everyone had left, Laura immediately became mad at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored her image, rushed towards me like crazy, raised her hand, and was about to slap me hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood firmly on the spot, and grabbed her wrist accurately and firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her and said coldly, "What are you doing? Do you think it was not embarrassing enough just now? Do you want to try it again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura stared at me with wide eyes. She probably didn't expect that I would be so heartless now, so she was so angry that she couldn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was suddenly heard behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott, Laura suddenly became excited, struggled to break away from my hand, and rushed towards Elliott. Then, she suddenly cried before Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you are here! I was bullied by this bitch just now! You have to speak for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura immediately complained to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said coldly and noticed Giselle, who fell on the ground, so he asked immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slowly turned around and met Elliott's eyes. He looked at me in confusion, while I was desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you came just in time. Tonight, thanks to your mother, everyone in Hoswich knows you have a baby with Giselle. Let's meet at the Courthouse tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too lazy to explain more. After saying this, I held Quinn's arms in front of Elliott and walked toward the center of the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Needless to say, Quinn understood my thoughts in an instant, cooperated with me, and whispered to me, "Don't let them affect your mood. Let's go. I'll take you to meet some of my friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly dragged me directly into the venue. At this time, the annual banquet had already begun, and the passionate music from the speakers had drowned out the noise in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look back or bother to care about how Elliott would deal with Laura and Giselle. I quickly calmed down and sat in my seat as the leader of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of what happened just now, those rich ladies had sympathy for me, so they were very friendly to me and introduced their husbands to me one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Glory Group had now greatly increased its reputation in the industry with Do Not Love, which has allowed my abilities to be initially recognized in the circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was holding a glass of wine, chatting and laughing with them, and soon I forgot about the unpleasantness just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say last time that you wanted to meet the person in charge of Infinite Precision? He's there." Quinn led me through the crowd, willing to be my companion. After walking around with me, he suddenly pointed at a middle-aged man and said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked in the direction he pointed and saw that the other party was talking to someone. I didn't know this person. However, I was surprised to find that the lady standing next to him was the lady who spoke for me just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made me feel surprised. I immediately stepped forward and walked to the lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, madam, we just met, do you still remember?"</span></p></div>
