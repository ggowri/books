        <h1>Chapter 348 I Will Take the Lead</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott brought me home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As my mother got happy, she finally started cooking again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we opened the door, a rich aroma hit our nostrils.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother had already put the food on the table. When she saw us coming in, she immediately rushed to us enthusiastically and said, "You guys are back. Just in time, I just made some food! Come on, wash your hands, and come over to eat it while it's hot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, thank you for your hard work, cooking such a large table of dishes." Elliott knew how to please my mother. He immediately showed his compliments as soon as he walked in the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was beaming,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There aren't many dishes. I didn't buy any good ingredients. But when your dad wakes up one day, I will prepare a whole table of dishes to celebrate with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will provide good ingredients and wines when that day comes." Elliott catered to my mother with a smile. Then he went to wash his hands with me and sat at the dining table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have worked hard. This soup is stewed specially for you. Have some first," as soon as we sat down, my mother said immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shared some soup with me and Elliott respectively and placed them in front of us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This soup looked very yellow. All the oil-stained in the soup was filtered out by my mother in advance, so it was light and delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a bite, Elliott immediately praised my mom and said the soup was delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother's cooking skills were top-notch. It was a pity that in my previous life, Elliott didn't want to come to my house so he didn't know my mother's good cooking skills. Instead, he thought Nicole's food was most delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day I went to Giselle's home and tasted her mother's dishes. What her mother cooked was nothing more than home-cooked meals, which were hugely different from my mother's dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched Elliott eating so happily tonight and started to think about the experiences in my previous life. I couldn't help but feel in a trance. So I put down my fork and just looked at him quietly with my chin in my hand. I enjoyed the hard-won happiness in this life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why not eat? Just looking at Elliott? " My mother didn't save my face even in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly withdrew my gaze. "Mom, what are you talking about? I'm already full and have no appetite to eat more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw my embarrassment. He suppressed his laughter and followed my mother to tease me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you know that she has been obsessed with me for so many years. Now let her feast her eyes. She can look at me as long as she wants."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!" I was so ashamed that I couldn't help but issue a verbal warning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, my mother laughed together with Elliott. She refused to help me and said, "That's right. I think your face is more attractive than my meal. Madeline probably doesn't need to eat if she can look at you every day. Otherwise, why would she be so thin? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" I was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought that my mother would choose to help Elliott rather than me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this meal, I was teased by them. How can I have an appetite to eat?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just simply put down my fork and told them I was full. Then I went upstairs and entered the bathroom to take a shower.</span></p></div>
