        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled lightly, looking at me with a hint of helplessness. "Madeline, we're husband and wife. The way you're talking, it's as if I'm some sort of lascivious villain in your eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was full of grievance, and I couldn't help but laugh: "Well, you are."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, when I'm alone with Elliott, I'm always on guard. I've hardly ever laughed in his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I let out a laugh, and Elliott joined in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's been a while since I've seen you smile. You look so beautiful when you do. And with this, you'd look even more stunning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott suddenly produced a deep blue, square-shaped jewelry box.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?" I blurted out, my surprise evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, my heart started to pound uncontrollably. There was a subtle anticipation building within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman can resist a surprise. So, upon seeing this box, I can't help but feel a sense of anticipation, wondering what could possibly be inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat taken aback by my own reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should be feeling disdain, yet for some reason, that's not what I'm feeling at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott flipped open the jewelry box, revealing a necklace that shimmered brilliantly within. The pendant, shaped like a begonia flower, was unlike anything I'd seen in stores, yet it was incredibly beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your diary, you mentioned your fondness for begonias. On the day you were born, the begonias in your family's garden bloomed unexpectedly. So, I had this necklace custom-made for you, with your name engraved on the back. This one-of-a-kind piece was designed by the renowned French jeweler, Char."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he pulled out a necklace from the box, placing it before my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The carriage was dimly lit, yet even in the subdued light, the necklace still shimmered with a subtle glow. The pendant, in particular, was of an exceptional shape and quality, exquisitely crafted. It was clear at a glance that it was a product of a designer's meticulous work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively glanced at the back of the pendant, finding the name "Madeline" etched into it. It was indeed custom-made for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've heard of the renowned French jeweler, Char. He's quite the big deal. Your average Joe can't just hire him. The cost for a custom design from him is through the roof.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, for my sake, was willing to go all out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I was overwhelmed with excitement. My usually calm heart was suddenly unable to find its peace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I put it on for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott caught on to my liking. Subsequently, he unclasped the necklace, wrapped his hand around the back of my neck, and adorned me with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's fingers were a touch too cold, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine as they brushed against my skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air in the car was stagnant and somewhat stifling. At this point, Barry cranked up the air conditioning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden chill in the air cooled my fevered mind in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like snapping back from a dream, my sanity returned in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's happening to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Elliott did was stick up for me at the dinner table and gift me a necklace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was actually moved?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, all the past pains were forgotten?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Am I about to fall into Elliott's trap again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed myself thoroughly in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Elliott was about to clasp the necklace around my neck, I yanked it off in an instant, saying coldly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a precious gift, how could I possibly accept it? I can't take it!"</span></p></div>
