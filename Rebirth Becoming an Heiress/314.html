        <h1>Chapter 314 Found Clues</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right, I looked into the background of that driver and found out he had a seven-year-old son who lived with his grandparents. Just the day before he died, someone deposited a million dollars into his father's account, Quinn hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A million dollars? From what you've learned, the driver was a gambler, had no stable job, and was divorced, right?" Hearing Quinn's words, I became instantly alert and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he owed a lot of debts. If I'm not mistaken, he probably couldn't pay his debts, so someone hired him specifically to cause this car accident. If that's the case, it definitely proves that the car accident wasn't an accident," Quinn said solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought the same thing. This indicated that my initial hunch was correct.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone must have wanted to harm my dad, so they hired someone to crash into his car. Fortunately, my dad was lucky enough to turn the steering wheel in time, avoiding a direct collision with the truck and only hitting the passenger side. That was how he narrowly escaped with his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone hired an assailant, they surely intended to kill my dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And based on my past life experiences, I was a hundred percent sure that it was Jade and her father's doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you trace the recipient account of that transaction?" I asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shook his head. "The money was transferred in batches through multiple ATMs. It's going to be difficult to trace the mastermind behind the hit. However, have your dad offended anyone recently? You should be able to find out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if I had to guess, it would be my cousin and uncle. Jade has been eyeing the top position at Glory Group for a long time. If I hadn't been holding my dad back, she would have been promoted to deputy director this year." I considered Quinn my best friend and naturally had no secrets from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Quinn fell into deep thought as if remembering something. "If that's the case, you must eliminate these two from Glory Group as soon as possible, or else, there will be endless trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. I've already gathered some evidence of my cousin embezzling company funds, but it's not enough. I'm still looking for more evidence," I said firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll help you search. During this time, you and your mother should be careful. Just to be safe, I'll find a few bodyguards to guard your family," Quinn said vigilantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't reminded me, I wouldn't have thought about these things temporarily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, even though it was a lawful society, one must be cautious. Jade dared to target my dad, and last time she had someone target me. What other insane things might she do? I couldn't anticipate it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll leave it to you. Quinn, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to do..." I looked at Quinn, feeling a surge of indescribable gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, I bore all these traumas alone. I never expected to have a friend like Quinn in this life. No matter what happened, he always stood by my side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, so touched. Why don't you just marry me then?" Quinn saw me getting emotional again, so he reached out and playfully pinched my cheek, tilting his mouth to reveal a mischievous smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw you." Of course, I knew he was just joking. So, I punched his chest hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say so much to me. Like I said, I'll be your protector until the day you don't need me anymore." Quinn smiled and patted my head. After saying that, he turned and walked away.</span></p></div>
