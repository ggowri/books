        <h1>Chapter 84 You Were Tempting Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated not at all and took off his clothes, as if we had already been married for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed and stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was brightly lit. Under the light, I could clearly see his muscular figure. His skin was glowing, and the muscles on his arms and back were smooth and defined. The perfect posture he exuded emitted male hormones that made my heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively lowered my head and dared not look at him anymore. I said, "Why are you so open now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't feel embarrassed and actually walked towards me with his upper body bare. Soon, his perfect abs appeared before my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Isn't this normal for couples?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is normal for other couples, but abnormal for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott knew I wanted to escape. He reached out his hand and grabbed my chin, making me look directly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your face is so hot. Why are you blushing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the reason but still asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was 26 years old, I was still a married virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood naked in front of me, showing off his perfect upper body. How could I not blush?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to turn my head and look elsewhere. However, he deliberately didn't let go of me, so I had to glare at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I suspected that you were seducing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but laugh when he heard what I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he would continue teasing me. While I was contemplating what to do, he let go of me and walked into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I didn't think so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice came from the bathroom along with the sound of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better this way," I deliberately answered loudly. Then, I turned around, opened the door, and conscientiously went to the guest bedroom, keeping as much distance from him as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to take a shower when I suddenly remembered that my clothes and skincare products were still in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I took the car keys and went downstairs to the garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The garage was very dark. I opened the car door. Just as I was about to grab my bag and leave, something shiny caught my attention from the gap in the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached out and picked up the thing, only to discover that it was actually a crystal hairpin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hairpin looks inexpensive and is not actually made of real crystal. However, its swan shape is unique. This is something that young girls like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized something when I saw the hairpin that Giselle always wore, just like the white swan necklace. This hairpin must have been accidentally left in the car by Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Giselle had already ridden Elliott's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was Elliott who picked Giselle up from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, I felt very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered, "Has Elliott developed feelings for Giselle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should have been like this. Otherwise, how could he have distanced himself from Sylvia so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am grateful tonight that I was not swayed by Elliott's words, thanks to this hairpin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Elliott has changed his attitude towards me now, it doesn't mean anything. The person he loves is Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just a passerby who would eventually leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I realized the truth, I didn't want Giselle to easily be with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how Giselle arrogantly took away everything that belonged to me in my past life and cruelly threw me into the sea, I couldn't help but feel angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was Elliott's first love, they would eventually be together. In this lifetime, I will not let them easily overlook me and be together. I swear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p></div>
