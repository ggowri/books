        <h1>Chapter 841: A Familiar Voice</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was laden with local dishes and snacks from Hoswich city, stirring up a wealth of childhood memories for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's parents and mine hit it off splendidly, reminiscing about the past. We, the younger generation, thoroughly enjoyed listening to their stories.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meal took quite a while, but everyone was having a blast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dinner party came to a close, I glanced at the time, realizing it was already past eight in the evening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, even if Elliott and his crew were dining here, they should have finished by now, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah stirred awake at that moment, bursting into tears. Lily quickly attended to him, nursing him back to calmness. Quinn's parents also gathered around, their eyes filled with affection for the adorable Noah. The sight of him sparked lively conversations, filling the room with joy and laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I quietly slipped out of the room, heading to the bar to settle the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was settling the bill at the bar when an eerily familiar voice echoed from not too far away:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fox, I didn't realize you folks weren't fond of seafood. My apologies. I'll arrange a different feast for you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all old family friends here. Your dad and I were classmates back in the day, so there's no need for you to feel sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but follow the sound with my gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spotted Elliott, clad in a dark suit, strolling over from a distance with an elder whose beard had turned white.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And trailing behind them was a group of people, among which not only included Laura, but it seemed Lisa was there too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Fox?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he be Lisa's father?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself wondering, then I remembered the text Elliott had sent me. He mentioned he'd be a bit tied up these next few days. A friend of his father's was coming over for a visit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would have thought, I'd actually bump into them here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, the total comes to $6849. But you can just pay $6800."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in a daze, the cashier suddenly nudged me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, got it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of an eye, I snapped back to reality, ready to pay up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She doesn't need to pay. Just put it on my tab along with my room charges."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice echoed in my ear once again, and then, he reached out, blocking my view of my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I can handle it myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily declined, promptly settling the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the formality with me? Madeline, I didn't expect to see you dining here. Perfect timing, let me introduce you to..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was a bit exasperated, but seeing that I had already paid, he didn't continue to argue. Instead, he turned around, ready to introduce me to his party guests.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm worried that my parents and Quinn might bump into Elliott just as they come out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in a rush, I blurted out, "Elliott, I'm swamped right now. My client's inside, I gotta go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flatly rejected him, then immediately headed towards my room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I moved so fast, so fast that I didn't even catch what Elliott had said. I darted back to my room and promptly shut the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my panicked expression, Quinn hurried over and asked, "Madeline, what's wrong? You're as pale as a ghost."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to respond, a knock at the door echoed from outside.</span></p></div>
