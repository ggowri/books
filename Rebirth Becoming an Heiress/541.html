        <h1>Chapter 541 Comfort</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately sneered, "I thought you were so devoted to Elliott. I didn't expect you to find another husband so quickly, and pregnant at that. I wonder how Elliott would see you if he knew about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's in the past tense for me now. How he sees me is his business. Do you have anything else to say? If not, move aside and don't block our way!" I couldn't be bothered to waste more words on Giselle. After saying these words, I bypassed her and walked out with Jessica, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel Giselle's two sharp gazes shooting towards me from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't bother to look back. Hand in hand with Jessica, we headed towards Fiona's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, I apologized, "Jessica, I'm sorry. My past is complicated. If you mind, I can just be friends with Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you saying? Who doesn't have a past? Besides, it's not your fault. You're also a victim. We've heard about what happened in the Bryant family. Quinn's aunt mentioned it when she came home last time. You don't have to punish yourself for other people's mistakes. The Bryant family will pay for their actions sooner or later," Jessica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised to learn that Jessica not only knew everything but also didn't mind. Instead, she comforted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kindness was just like Quinn's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moved, I looked at her, finally understanding why Quinn was so good. It turned out he had such an enlightened and kind mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes teared up, and I couldn't help but choke up. "But I've been divorced after all. Jessica, if you mind, you can just say it. I really don't want to cause any trouble for Quinn because of me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they reassured me, the more guilty I felt. I couldn't help feeling unworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What era are we in? Why are you still thinking about these things? Rest assured, if my parents can invite you to dinner at home, they must have investigated your situation thoroughly before letting Quinn invite you. You don't need to worry about anything. Just focus on nurturing your baby. Overthinking isn't good for the child," Carole suddenly said, apparently overhearing our conversation with her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made me suddenly realize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was right, the Woods family, with their low-key and cautious approach, wouldn't be rash about their children's marriages. And my situation wasn't a secret in Hoswich. Once they investigated, they would know the whole story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you don't need to think too much about it now. Take good care of the baby in your belly. Although Quinn may be unreliable, we know him. Once he's made up his mind about someone, he won't change it. As parents, we have no other wish but for our children's happiness," Jessica said sincerely, holding my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we chatted, we arrived at Fiona's office. Inside, we saw Quinn already sitting there, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was lounging in the chair, seemingly relaxed while scrolling through his phone, but the nervousness on his face betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he heard footsteps, he immediately looked up and rushed towards me, gripping my shoulders anxiously. "How did it go? How's the examination?"</span></p></div>
