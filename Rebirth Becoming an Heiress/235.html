        <h1>Chapter 235 Misunderstanding</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this scene, I suddenly remembered that at the end of my previous life, Jade and her father caused my family to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To pay back the money, Lily had no choice but to work as an orderly in the hospital. At that time, Nicole was sick, and Lily took care of her, but I didn't know it at first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when I found out, I learned Nicole humiliated Lily every day, verbally disparaged her, and destroyed Lily's self-esteem, which later led to Lily becoming more and more desperate. Finally, Lily committed suicide shortly after Austin's death.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't imagine how devastating those days were for Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grew up in a privileged family and had been accustomed to living a wealthy and smooth life. Those days of humiliation were a nightmare for her, and Nicole was the culprit of her nightmare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the huge gap between Nicole and Lily now and thinking that Nicole and her family would live well because of Elliott, I was filled with resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently told myself, "Madeline, you must work hard. No matter what, I will never let my parents fall into the same situation as in my previous life, and I will never allow Nicole and Giselle to bully my mom and me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of everything that happened in my previous life made me feel suffocated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after chatting with Cormac for a while, I planned to go out for some fresh air and let the three women chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked out of the ward and came to the side of the corridor. Unexpectedly, Giselle actually followed me out, and she said from behind, "Madeline, why didn't you come to pick Elliott up last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mentioned this matter deliberately again. I frowned subconsciously and turned to look at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still dressed like a fragile woman today, wearing a light yellow dress and a white sweater. She looked like a daisy blooming in the wind in the mountain, with a hint of pity in her elegance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it just give you a chance? Didn't you seize it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wasn't there anyway, so I spoke more bluntly, intending to expose her pretense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words made Giselle look a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Madeline, what do you mean? Do you have any misunderstanding about me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You care about my husband so much. You even ate with him in the middle of the night and sent me photos. Didn't you just want me to misunderstand you?" I asked, sounding a little aggressive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was outspoken and couldn't stand such a hypocritical person like Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle raised her head, looking innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sent you the photo just to tell you that nothing happened between Elliott and me. He said he was in a bad mood and asked me to stay with him, so I went. Later, he drank a lot, and I sent him home. By the way, I had breakfast with him this morning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she say that? She was so shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Giselle meant she slept with Elliott last night, so they had breakfast together this morning, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank for a moment, and I felt very uncomfortable.</span></p></div>
