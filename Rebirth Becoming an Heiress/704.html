        <h1>Chapter 704 Self-Empowerment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trembled all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time I heard Marcus speak such emotional words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and happened to meet his gaze, and in that moment, his eyes filled with a heart-wrenching expression almost overwhelmed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, until the moment before my death, I had never received a gaze that understood me and cared for me like this, neither from Quinn nor Marcus, they never appeared in my world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, all I received was cold cruelty, just like the vast sea that I </span><span>indulged in before my death, coldly devouring me, tearing at my soul, destroying my willpower, and shattering all my fantasies about love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this lifetime, I never thought that after completely letting go of Elliott, it turns out that in this world, there is more than one person who would care for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood the meaning behind Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also knew what he was expressing to me at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this stage, I just wanted to close all emotional channels and walk a path of my own, to find back the self that has been lost for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you for your concern, but I believe that in the near future, there will be a woman worthy of your love appearing." I brushed it off, ignoring the deeper meaning behind his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood the deeper meaning in my words as well. He smiled calmly and said, "I knew you would say that. I have also been through the same phase as you. The reason I am telling you all this today is to let you know that you should never give up the entire forest for just one leaf. You are wonderful enough, and there are many people in this world who want to cherish you. Don't linger too long with those who don't appreciate you or trample on your inner self, and don't exhaust yourself too much. It's great to be an independent and strong woman, but if you become too tired, it's also a good choice to take a break and find solace in a man's embrace before continuing on. No matter which path you choose, you will encounter different scenery. Don't rush to cut off all possibilities, try to relax. You are too tense, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You were too tense, Madeline...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words scratched lightly on my heart like a cat's claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like being poked right at the core by someone, the tears that I had been holding back for a long time couldn't be restrained any longer and suddenly welled up from my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned around and looked out of the window. I didn't want Marcus, or anyone else, to see through my vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he still saw it and quietly handed me a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently shed a tear, but within a few seconds I regained composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly blew my nose with a tissue, and then, I took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cannot relax now because there are still many things I haven't done. When my child is born, I will have to face many things. Moreover, my parents are also getting older, and there is Glory Group. Although the previous crisis has been temporarily resolved, managing such a large company and taking care of so many people who depend on it for their livelihoods, I have to consider all of these. I don't want to be a powerful woman, but I am very clear that I don't want to rely on a man. I only want to rely on myself and stand proudly in this world, whether it's in my career, my family, or my child. I will give it my all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is also the reason why I have not rested since I got pregnant until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stop chasing the world's footsteps and give up everything just because I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spent too much time in the past ten years on dating. From now on, I don't want men and emotions to occupy too much of my energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for children, they are certainly important, but as modern women, how can we stop our own pursuit of self-improvement just because of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, I had already thought enough, and I was very clear about my future, what kind of path I would take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still wanted to persuade me, "But this way, you are too tired, after all, you are a woman..."</span></p></div>
