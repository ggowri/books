        <h1>Chapter 368 Emotional</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of blood suddenly erupted from deep within my lungs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could utter a word, crimson liquid spurted forth, ushering in a tumultuous cascade of sensations&mdash;restlessness, discomfort, and a suffocating sense of depression. My consciousness quickly succumbed to confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid this chaotic maelstrom, I faintly perceived someone urgently calling my name, his arms enfolding me as we raced forward with desperate haste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the clamor, the cacophony of various instruments and distant voices filled the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I longed to open my eyes, my consciousness remained ensnared in a fog of disarray. No matter how I strained, my eyelids refused to obey. Then, silence enveloped me like a heavy shroud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I fell into complete silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I finally emerged from the abyss, I found myself surrounded by sterile white walls and the cold glint of medical instruments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I raised my arm, only to discover an IV drip attached to my hand. Clad in a hospital gown, I realized I lay within the confines of a hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Casting my gaze around, I emitted a small cough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, my hand was grasped&mdash;tight and reassuring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice broke through the silence, "Madeline, you're awake? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning, I beheld Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still wearing the suit he wore when we were at the Bryant Villa last night. His appearance was slightly disheveled, with unruly hair and a hint of stubble. His bloodshot eyes betrayed a mixture of surprise and concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he look like that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always paid attention to his appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I longed to reach out and chide him for his unkempt appearance, but memories of the Bryant Villa flooded back with crushing force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here, Elliott? Leave! I don't want to see you&mdash;get out!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions surged, eclipsing all reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every fiber of my being recoiled at his presence, a potent cocktail of nausea and revulsion enveloping me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, calm down, please listen&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's shock was palpable. He leaned forward and wanted to comfort me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his touch only fueled my agitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Fiona, a nurse, burst into the room. Alarmed by my distressed state, she rushed to my side, urging Elliott to depart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, make him leave! Get him out of here&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice dripped with venomous hatred as I glared at Elliott, consumed by a violent urge to expunge his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to calm down, but I found that I couldn't control myself at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't doubt that if I had a knife right now, I would stab him with no hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona noticed that my mental condition was unstable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained, "Elliott, please leave the room. You being here will only make her worse. I will help her calm down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was obviously shocked by my behavior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go out first. Fiona, you must find a way to enlighten her, she has never been like this. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he reluctantly exited, Fiona enveloped me in a gentle embrace, her soothing words gradually quelling my frenzied emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Madeline. Paige and I are here for you. Tell us what happened. You're safe now&mdash;don't be afraid. We'll help you through this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott leaving, Fiona held me in her arms. She gently massaged my temples and soothed me softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gradually calmed down with her help.</span></p></div>
