        <h1>Chapter 580 The Elusive Thoughts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The series of cries instantly jolted me awake from my dream. As I opened my eyes and realized it was just a dream, my whole body was still trembling. I immediately sought solace in Quinn's embrace, tears streaming down helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nightmare, huh? It's okay, I'm here, I'll always be here, everything will be alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn comforted me with the patience of a saint, gently patting my back as if I were a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually calming my emotions, I looked around to confirm it was just a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shakily expressed. "I dreamt of falling into the sea again, it was so terrifying, the feeling was just too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand, you must have some psychological trauma. We'll try to stay away from the seaside in the future, never let you play on the waters again," Quinn spoke in a deep tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was so scared just now, thought I was going to die again, that dream, it felt so real..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I muttered to myself, unaware of the slight slip in my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, oblivious to it, stroked my hair gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With me here, you won't die. I've said it before, I'll always be your guardian, silently protecting you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I leaned on Quinn's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warm embrace gradually calmed my restless heart, helping me regain my composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst this, I felt a peculiar undertone in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always gave me the feeling that he knew my past life very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I vividly remembered him grabbing my arm when I fell into the water, a scene so eerily similar to my past life's final moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, did you save me in the sea before?" I asked, feigning composure after a moment of contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly felt a slight tremor in his body upon hearing my question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he smiled, "Are you silly? Asking such a question? Don't you know if I saved you or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cut me off with those words, leaving me momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the concept of reincarnation defied scientific explanation, and bringing it up might startle him if things weren't as I presumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't dwell on it. If you're scared, I'll stay by your side. Get some more rest, the doctor mentioned your body is still weak and needs more rest." Quinn diverted the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He urged me to lie down, then quietly sitting beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to sleep again, but it eluded me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the yacht being touted as luxurious, the soundproofing seemed lacking. Shortly after lying down, noises from the adjacent room, unmistakably of a romantic nature, reached my ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds made me extremely embarrassed. I never expected the woman next door to be so uninhibited, progressively becoming louder and more unrestrained in her cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on my side facing away from Quinn, frozen in place, while he, too, held his breath, making no movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night felt unusually long, the solitary sounds of the waves outside incessant and unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to be enduring the torment as well, abruptly standing up, walking to the window to light a cigarette, and puffing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shut my eyes, trying not to dwell. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, the noises next door finally ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I drifted back to sleep without realizing when.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I awoke once more, the sky was already bright. Sitting up in bed, I saw Quinn peacefully asleep on the couch, one hand supporting his head in that position.</span></p></div>
