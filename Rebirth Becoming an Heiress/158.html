        <h1>Chapter 158 Emergency</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I checked the weather forecast for Hoswich, and it's going to rain heavily for the next few days. If I remember correctly, perlite is water-absorbent, so these perlite stones must be moved now! Otherwise, once they absorb a large amount of water, do you think the underlying framework can withstand such a heavy weight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly voiced my question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this kind of problem, professional Jimmy definitely understood better than me. When I said this, his expression instantly changed, clearly indicating that he suddenly realized the seriousness of the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, if you hadn't reminded me, I wouldn't have thought of that. This pile of pumice stones was already here before, and I thought that such things were relatively light, completely forgetting that they could absorb water! I will immediately have someone check the load-bearing capacity and get them moved right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimmy broke out in a cold sweat and no longer brushed me off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hastily summoned his subordinates and immediately went to the scene to conduct an inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the heavy rain was still pouring down, and I stayed at the scene to supervise because I was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood beside me, looking blankly. I didn't know what she was thinking, but I could sense that she occasionally glanced at me out of the corner of her eye, more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't expect you to know all this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Giselle couldn't resist and finally spoke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is common knowledge that anyone who has studied physics and chemistry would probably have a basic understanding of these."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I directly refuted it. One sentence made her face turn red instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, I heard a worker exclaim, "Oh no, the scaffolding on this side has already tilted. If we don't move these perlite rocks quickly, it will definitely collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry! Get everyone to help! We must move these pumice stones before the collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers discovered a problem during the inspection, and the atmosphere on-site instantly became tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and all the workers started moving the pumice stones. However, on one hand, they were not as agile due to the rain, and on the other hand, it took time to move these pumice stones down from the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation becoming more and more urgent, I didn't care about anything and directly joined their team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never done such physical work before, and I didn't know I had so much strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just felt that since I was on the scene, I couldn't just stand by and do nothing. By contributing a little more effort, the losses could be reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The workers saw me joining the team, and their enthusiasm increased. Giselle, upon seeing me join, also decided to join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under my proposal, we formed an artificial assembly line, which made transportation more time-saving and labor-saving, and improved efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I enthusiastically accompanied them to work, without caring at all whether I got wet or not. I persisted in the pouring rain for over an hour, until I was completely exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the pile of perlite being gradually moved, I couldn't help but smile with relief, despite feeling exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to relax, suddenly, a worker came over carrying a discarded beam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked quickly, without noticing my presence at all. I only felt a gust of wind by my ear, and then suddenly, my ears started ringing, and my brain felt like it was hit by something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, I had already collapsed, and from my mouth, salty liquid immediately gushed out...</span></p></div>
