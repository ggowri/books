        <h1>Chapter 379 Photo</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle tightly bit her lip, looking aggrieved and fragile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, do you really not remember what happened that night at Dikio? You were drunk, and I helped you into the room. You held my hand and asked me not to leave, so I stayed..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! There was no one in my room that night! Besides, I asked Barry, and he said he helped me back. Barry wouldn't lie to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone grew harsher, and his gaze towards Giselle became more disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked up, tears swirling in her eyes. With a choked voice, she said, "Elliott, you clearly said that night that you would take responsibility for me. But now, in front of Madeline, you dare to deny it! Are you really going to force me to show evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Giselle mean she had evidence from that night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shivered, unable to help but glance at Elliott. I could sense a hint of surprise in his eyes too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What evidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Elliott could speak, I asked first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Giselle took out her phone and approached. In front of Elliott and me, her hands trembling, she opened the photo album.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my astonishment, I saw a photo in Giselle's phone album of her and Elliott lying together on a bed. In the photo, Elliott's upper body was bare, while Giselle wore only a bath towel, sitting on the edge of the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This photo struck a nerve with me, and I instinctively wanted to grab the phone and look again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Giselle quickly put the phone away and then threw herself into Elliott's arms, sobbing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I was still a virgin when we made love. And I'm carrying your child. I don't ask you to cherish me, I just hope you won't erase what happened between us that night. After all, the child is innocent."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle cried bitterly, clinging tightly to Elliott's waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trembled all over, unable to hold back, and took a few steps back unsteadily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Elliott wide-eyed, my chest heaving. I couldn't believe they had really sex.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat still, clearly shocked, then quickly glanced at me as if feeling my pain. He stood up abruptly and pushed Giselle away instinctively!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle fell backward, her waist hitting the corner of the coffee table, causing her to let out a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole rushed over in a panic, quickly supporting Giselle, shouting loudly, "Giselle, what's wrong? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, my... my stomach hurts, it hurts so much..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle held her waist, her brows furrowed, her features contorted, and let out another agonizing scream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole was distraught, crying out in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I know our family background isn't great. We may not match up to your Bryant family, but Giselle is still someone our family nurtured carefully. Even if you look down on her, you can't trample on her like this, disregarding her life, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole's cries were heart-wrenching, causing Sean and all the staff from Serenity Villa to rush over in a panic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face had turned pale by now. She lay in Nicole's arms, looking at Elliott with such helplessness and sadness, calling out repeatedly, "Elliott, my stomach hurts so much. It really hurts. Please, save me, save our child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood still. Initially, he didn't move. But when he saw blood seeping from under Giselle, his eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he couldn't help but feel compassion. Without even looking at me, he immediately squatted down and picked Giselle up from the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he yelled at Sean, "What are you waiting for? Call an ambulance, quick!"</span></p></div>
