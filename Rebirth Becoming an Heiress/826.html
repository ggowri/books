        <h1>Chapter 826: Arrival at the Airport</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wasn't always this meticulous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seldom cares about what I love to eat, what I fancy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, his sudden thoughtfulness caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling a bit drowsy before, but now, sleep seems to elude me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning sleep proved to be a bit of a challenge, so I decided to just open my eyes and sit up straight. I asked, feigning confusion, "How did I fall asleep? How much longer until we reach Vespera Airport?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're two hours out, Mrs. Bryant. You can catch some more sleep," came Barry's voice from the front seat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm awake now, Elliott. You should catch some sleep too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually glanced over my shoulder at Elliott, our eyes meeting in a serendipitous moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a grin, "Madeline, you've finally stopped calling me by my full name!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that so?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I always call him by his full name before?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't even noticed that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left me a bit dazed, but as I mulled it over, it seemed he was right. A subconscious smile tugged at my lips:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it weird to use full names? Many couples do that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's off. You usually call me Elliott, sometimes even honey. Seems like I must've messed up somewhere recently, or haven't been doing well enough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, took it seriously, beginning to reflect on his own mistakes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't overthink it. You should get some rest, you didn't sleep well last night."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to delve deeper into this topic with Elliott, so I simply urged on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, got it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott obediently closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to lean in, resting his head on my lap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure if he was just too tired, or if my presence genuinely helped him sleep. But before long, I could hear the steady rhythm of Elliott's breathing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively glanced down at him. His eyes were closed, his lashes long. His skin was flawless. With Elliott's looks, he could easily become a superstar, even if he ventured into acting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, I was utterly infatuated with his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Him sleeping with his head on my lap, it's something I've always yearned for.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that it's happened, I find myself not as thrilled as I thought I would be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome appearance no longer stirs my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, I could feel my thigh going numb with him using it as a pillow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time sure does drag on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after two long hours, the moment the car pulled into the airport entrance, I couldn't help but let out a deep sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nudged Elliott's arm, "Wake up, we're at the airport."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes snapped open instantly. He rose from my lap, casting a glance out the window. His voice, raspy, murmured, "We're here already."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry swiftly parked the car in the basement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Elliott and I got out of the car.</span></p></div>
