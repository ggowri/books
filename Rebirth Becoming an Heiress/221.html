        <h1>Chapter 221 Felt Sorry for Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, now that Madeline objects, just forget it. It doesn't matter. My brother and I can earn money slowly. I believe that one day, we can buy a house on our own."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know when Giselle came down from upstairs. She changed her clothes and walked over with a faint smell of perfume on her body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the scent was the same as that in Elliott's car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head to look at her, and my eyes fell on her neck. I didn't expect that she suddenly put on a pearl necklace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the necklace was not as eye-catching as the one Laura had sent to me, it made me feel very familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly remembered that there was a banquet where Laura once wore this pearl necklace. If I remember correctly, it was Elliott's gift for Laura after he took a trip abroad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Laura had given Giselle this pearl necklace as a gift.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Giselle was wearing it on purpose just to show off in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that she didn't have a stomachache. She just wanted to go upstairs and show off to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly change into this dress? This is the birthday gift Elliott prepared for you, but your birthday hasn't come yet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole saw Giselle and couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked. I stood up and took a look at Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I realize that the dress she was wearing was just released this year by a famous brand. It was impossible for Giselle to afford it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered if it was the birthday present Elliott had given to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had never given me any birthday gifts, and he didn't even remember when my birthday was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt furious and couldn't suppress my emotions anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Elliott and then watched Giselle and Nicole. I suddenly felt cold and dizzy. The house was too suffocating, and I couldn't stand steadily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around and ran out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly caught up with me and yelled behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept running forward, with tears flowing down my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran to the main road. When I was about to cross the road, Elliott hugged me from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was urgent, and he was panting heavily. "What are you doing? Are you running away again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I didn't run away, should I have stayed there and let my love rival see me lose my composure?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I didn't leave, did I have to let Elliott hurt me again and again in such an unintentional way?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled bitterly. I didn't want to cry, but my tears still flowed down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and tried my best to adjust my breathing. At this moment, Elliott turned my body and made me face him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my tears, he felt sorry for me and stretched out his hand to wipe them from my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "I just treat her like a younger sister and pity her family. Madeline, don't be like this."</span></p></div>
