        <h1>Chapter 197 Visiting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by being on the front line can one accumulate more work experience and gain insights. During the day, I mingled with the crew on the set, and at night, I stayed up late in front of the computer organizing. At the same time, I also went through the financial report that Katrina gave me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To grow quickly, it is essential to wholeheartedly immerse oneself in it. Therefore, during the first two weeks after arriving in Louis City, all my thoughts were focused solely on work, without any spare time to ponder about anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was completely forgotten by me. In the city without him and Giselle, even my breathing became much smoother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, just as I was thoroughly enjoying this state, suddenly one day, I was in a meeting with the director discussing the upcoming filming process when Adam rushed in anxiously and whispered in my ear, "Madeline, someone claiming to be your husband says he wants to visit the set, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback and looked up at An Mingming in confusion. "What does he look like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam looked around and, perhaps feeling that there were too many people, he leaned closer to my ear and said in a lower voice, "Madeline, the thing is... he looks exactly like the person who took Giselle away from the bar last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly realized and nodded. "Okay, I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Elliott really visited the film crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately put down the documents in my hand and walked out, while Adam quickly caught up with me. He incredulously grabbed my arm and stuttered, "Madeline, the wealthy businessman that Giselle knows, he can't really be your husband, can he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam, who has always been eloquent, was so scared that he stuttered. It can be imagined how much impact this incident had on him. I could only smile calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe, I don't know if the wealthy businessman you mentioned is the same person as my husband. We'll find out when we meet later," I said and walked towards the outside of the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news of Elliott's arrival, my heart surprisingly remained calm, as if it was just seeing an old friend and didn't cause much ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's calculate the time, it has been two weeks since we last met, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he come over for this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that it was for another test again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wondering in my heart, and soon, I saw the tall figure standing at the entrance of the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't wear a suit, but instead wore a black turtleneck sweater paired with a light gray mid-length coat. He wore slim-fit cropped pants and casual leather shoes on the lower body, giving off a very Korean-style vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this set, if I remember correctly, was the outfit I bought for him but he kept it in the wardrobe all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's wrong with him now? How did he become more and more fond of wearing the clothes I bought?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat speechless, I walked up to him and smiled lightly as I greeted, "Why did you come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never come home, so I had to come and visit you. Have you been tired lately? Why do you look thinner?" Elliott seemed much more concerned than I did in my tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he saw me, he immediately walked up to me and embraced me in his arms. Then, he tenderly pinched my thin face, expressing both concern and indulgence.</span></p></div>
