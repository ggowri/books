        <h1>Chapter 522 Fever Finally Subsided</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not taking antibiotics. Just go with what Madeline said. I'll take the drug they developed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice was still weak, but his words were filled with support for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at him instinctively, and at that moment, Carole raised her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, have you lost your mind with this fever? Do you think your friend's opinion holds more weight than the doctors'? You're the only son in our family. If you end up dead, how do you think Mom and Dad will take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver said, "Mr. Woods is still running a high fever. I suggest we administer antibiotics sooner rather than later. As you can see, the hospital is bustling, and we have other matters to attend to. We hope you'll make a decision quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Oliver's words, I couldn't help but feel anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether relying on my memories from my past life or my confidence in the anti-flu capsule in this life, I understood better than anyone that antibiotics wouldn't be effective against this virus and might even worsen the condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Carole about to make a decision, I hastily pulled her aside, speaking sincerely, "Carole, perhaps you don't understand the relationship between Quinn and me, but we're good friends. I wouldn't do anything to harm him, especially not now. Moreover, I've experienced this virus firsthand. Antibiotics simply won't work against it. But the drug I recommend can quickly control the symptoms. Please, trust me on this, can you? I swear on my life, I would never joke about Quinn's health!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I swore earnestly, placing my hand over my heart and looking at Carole with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole looked at me with doubt. "Then tell me, if we use the drug you mentioned, how soon can he expect to see his fever subside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Best case scenario, one or two days. Worst case, three days. My colleagues and I have tried it, and it's specifically targeted against this virus. Also, consider this. If antibiotics were truly effective, why would the hospitals overflow with patients and more people seeking treatment?" I asserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole fell into contemplation. At this moment, Quinn spoke again, "Carole, I trust Madeline. Just listen to her. She wouldn't harm me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, let's give the drug you mentioned a try. I'll give you two days. How's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole wasn't one to waver. Eventually, she chose to believe me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at my watch, and it was time for Quinn's second dose of medication. I quickly retrieved two capsules from the box, poured some water, and had Quinn take them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already feverish and having just woken up under Carole's scolding, Quinn fell asleep again after taking the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn asleep, Carole said to me, "Please stay here to take care of my brother. I saw the medical staff downstairs were swamped. I'll go and see if there's anything I can help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, despite her bad temper, Carole was as helpful as Quinn, with no airs of a spoiled heiress. After speaking to me, she immediately went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stayed by Quinn's side for two full days. The next afternoon, he broke out in a heavy sweat, and his recurrent high fever finally subsided.</span></p></div>
