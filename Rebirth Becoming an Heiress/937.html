        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to say something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I was stunned as I looked at Elliott and then Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly feel that compared to Elliott's hostility towards Quinn before, this time, he had obviously been much more forgiving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have understood my inner difficulty as well, which is why he said those words; he was trying to find a new outlet for the relationship between the three of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, let out a bitter laugh, and he looked up at Elliott with self</span><span>-</span><span>deprecation laced in his eyes:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If you were me, can you still be friends or family after you've loved someone?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's pupils quake and he lowers his head momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Quinn, I </span><span>......</span><span> am sorry.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn, my heart became more and more messy and complicated, I simply didn't know what words to use to show the guilt I felt inside, so I had to apologize to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether or not I was going to get back together with Elliott, I had ultimately failed Quinn in his infatuation with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank and the air felt horribly suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us were silent for a long time before Quinn finally looked up and barely managed to squeeze out a smile at me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Actually, the moment I stepped onto the plane to Korea today, I foresaw that it would end this way. Only, I still want to gamble once, even if it's only a slim hope.Madeline, I very much hope that I'm the man who can give you a lifetime of happiness, it's just a pity that I appeared too late at your side, letting someone advance to the most important position in your heart. However, I have loved and you are the only woman I have ever loved in my life. I don't regret what I've done for you, but as long as you're doing well, I </span><span>......</span><span> am willing to disappear into your world.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said this slowly, his breath steady, every word coming from his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And every word he said was like a hammer gently hitting my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard him confess so truly, and watched him express his inner feelings so frankly in front of me, I had an indescribable heaviness and intolerance more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched his eyes a little red, I felt his inner waves, I know what he was feeling and experiencing at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, once I also tasted this kind of flavor, I know the pain, so I know his torment at this moment better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Quinn </span><span>......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, my eyes reddened as well, I wanted to say something, but I knew that no matter what I said it wouldn't comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still smiling, but his reddened eyes said it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted my shoulder with feigned relief:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, you and I don't need to say anything more, I understand what you're going to say. Don't worry, I'm not as fragile as you think, I'm used to being single for so many years, I'm just continuing to live my life as it is now. In fact, I've always wanted you to be happy, and please promise me that no matter who you're with in the future, you must be happy.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's hand was clearly resting gently on my shoulder, but I felt heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and I was just about to speak when Elliott's low voice came over:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Her future is definitely with me, I won't let anyone take her away from me.Quinn, don't worry, I'll be good to Madeline.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn moved his hand from my shoulder and he looked at Elliott with mockery in his gaze:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You better, if you hurt her again, I'll settle things with you.Elliott, mark my words!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I don't do well, you can always take her away from me. But if I'm able to give her happiness, I hope you'll keep your promise from today and disappear from my world and hers and stop messing with her heart.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course, I promise!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't hesitate, he took a deep breath as he made up his mind, he stood up and looked at Elliott once again:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But if I hear or know that she's not living a happy life, I'll be the first to not spare you. But Elliott, don't get cocky, Madeline just has some feelings for you right now, and it's not certain that you'll get back together.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn really knows me too well, he also knows Elliott too well, his words poked Elliott's soft underbelly, the smile on Elliott's face immediately froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I'll try to fight for it, you just need to quit, and you don't need to worry about the rest.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was laced with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn ignored him and turned his attention to me, his voice was low as he looked at me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, getting back together is a hard road too. Don't promise him too quickly, no matter what, give him a little more time to test it out, and, he has to pass the aunt and uncle's hurdle before you consider getting back together with him, you know, Noah is his child, you make him be responsible, never allow him to use busyness as an excuse to perfume you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said to me, with the tone of an older brother lecturing his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hmm... I know, and I have no intention of getting back together.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, telling the truth about what was going on inside of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott got a little anxious all of a sudden:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Quinn, how could you tell Madeline that in front of me? Do you know how hard it was for me to win back her heart?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, laughed deliberately:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's not that easy to win back a woman's heart.Elliott, not all the hurt can be exchanged for a sentence of it's okay in the end, you still have a long way to go.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished speaking, he patted Elliott's shoulder heavily and gave me another deep look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then made a show of picking up the backpack he had thrown on the couch and turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at his back, and at that moment, all the images of the past with him quickly passed in front of me like a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that he would completely disappear from my world from now on made my heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such an ending would be the best for him, and for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Quinn, you </span><span>......</span><span> take care of yourself.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but choke and shout at his back, tears falling down in a swish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn paused in his steps, he didn't turn around, he just waved his hand:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Good, you too.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he said that, he quickly pulled the doorknob, and then he rushed out like a gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't hold it back any longer, and in an instant the tears came pouring out like a dam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A big warm hand wrapped around me from behind me </span><span>......</span></p></div>
