        <h1>Chapter 529 To Be a Father</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing speaking, Elliott turned and walked out of the ward with heavy steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at his tall but dejected back, I, of course, was heartbroken at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately bit my lips hard and clenched my hands, determined to stick to my decision. I had to end the relationship, whether I could or not.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn could see through my forced indifference. After Elliott left, he turned, patted me on the shoulder, and asked in a low voice, "Are you okay? Are you still unwilling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not unwilling. We've come this far. Compromise will only harm me. However, you are involved in the drama. I'm afraid he won't forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled indifferently, "Whether he forgives me or not, I won't regret my choice. Besides, it was his family who were guilty. This is not the path you want to choose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, everyone wished for a family of three to live a happy and peaceful life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fate was absurd. Giselle's appearance shattered all my fantasies into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, without seeing Elliott, I had been quite calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to having too much on my mind or the effectiveness of the medication Marcus provided, I experienced very little nausea while in Carthage. Since I was pretty slender, my belly didn't show much, making it easy sometimes to forget I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having not gone for a checkup for so long, I didn't know how the baby was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously putting my hand on my belly, I said, "Regardless of whether this path aligns with my desires, I've chosen it. So, I will firmly walk on rather than repent of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, probably fearing that I would have concerns, firmly said, "Well, I'll accompany you. Don't worry. I will definitely protect the baby well and won't let him lack a father's love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words shocked me. When I was about to say something, Carole suddenly appeared at the entrance of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole had heard our conversation and misunderstood something. She rushed over at once and directly grabbed Quinn's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say to Madeline? What did you mean by the baby and a father's love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if it were amazing gossip, Carole was extremely thrilled at the moment. She questioned Quinn loudly, her voice echoing through the ward.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat, and I quickly explained, "Carole, you misunderstood. That is not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before I could finish my words, Quinn directly interrupted me. Looking at Carole, he said with incomparable seriousness, "Carole, what you heard is true. Madeline is indeed pregnant, and I'm going to be a father soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Carole roared in disbelief, and I was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing what Quinn was trying to do, I was so desperate to clear up the misunderstanding, but he winked at me repeatedly and prevented me from telling the truth.</span></p></div>
