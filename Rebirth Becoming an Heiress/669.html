        <h1>Chapter 669 A Stalker</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Accusation? What are you talking about? I calculated the timing. She hadn't completely broken up with Elliott when she got pregnant with this child. So, there is a </span><span>fifty percent chance that this child is Elliott's. Did I say something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura must have been going crazy with the desire for a grandson during this period, as she actually blurted out such words in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I felt humiliated from head to toe. I glared at her, about to speak, but Grey stood up abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, we are not like you. The Woods family would not easily accept a child of unknown origin, let alone create a scandalous situation. Madeline has no connection with you now. Please refrain from speaking nonsense in front of everyone, as it not only damages Madeline's reputation but also affects your son. I believe you understand this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mrs. Laura Bryant. Some things should not be said casually. Today is a big day for your family, so you should go and entertain other guests first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Mrs. Laura Bryant, you can't have a conflict today. Your blood pressure is already high, and if you get angry again, it could easily lead to a stroke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they realized something was wrong, several ladies immediately stood up and, while persuading Laura, led her to another table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to their mocking words, I found it somewhat amusing. However, I couldn't laugh and had no appetite for the food in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that I wasn't very happy, Grey squeezed my hand and comforted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't let her irrational words affect you. The Bryant family has been going through a lot lately. I think she's a bit unstable. Don't pay attention to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew. Grey, I went to the bathroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and then stood up, wanting to go to the bathroom to wash my face and calm down. So, I headed straight toward the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place where the Bryant family hosted the banquet was a vacation hotel located not far from the cemetery at the foot of a mountain. Perhaps due to being contracted by the Bryant family, the hotel was quite deserted. The corridors were empty. A gust of cold and eerie wind passed by, causing me to shiver uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously headed toward the direction of the bathroom. As I walked, I suddenly heard a series of footsteps following behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps were hurried. I instinctively looked back, but I didn't see anyone's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it probably the hotel waiter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't think much and continued toward the direction of the bathroom. However, just then, I heard the sound of heavy footsteps following closely once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps made me inexplicably feel a tingling sensation on my scalp. I thought it was another guest walking behind me, so I gathered my courage and looked back. However, as I turned around, the footsteps disappeared. There was still no trace of anyone behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I got goosebumps all over my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still, looking at the somewhat dark restroom, and for a moment, I didn't know whether I should move forward or quickly return to the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, there came the sound of rushing water from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was washing their hands in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately breathed a sigh of relief and quickly walked toward the direction of the restroom...</span></p></div>
