        <h1>Chapter 198 Treating to a Meal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather in St. Louis City was somewhat chilly. I was wearing a white woolen coat with a stand-up collar, paired with a light yellow shirt as an inner layer. For the bottom, I had on a slim-fit pair of jeans and low-heeled shoes. I had my hair stylist give my hair ends a slight curl, and I accessorized with a pair of four-leaf clover earrings. The whole look made me appear fresh and professional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly saw a flash of astonishment in Elliott's eyes when he first laid eyes on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said I had lost weight, but I felt that he looked thinner than before, and moreover, he seemed a bit worn out overall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like he had stayed up all night and had a poor sleep. There were obvious dark circles around his eyes, and his gaze was somewhat dull, lacking the sharpness and determination he used to have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, the food on the set was quite good, and I was in a good mood, eating well and sleeping well," I responded lightly. After giving him a brief hug, I immediately took two steps back, maintaining a certain distance from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were coming and going on the set, and in no time, everyone was passing the message to each other. It seemed like everyone knew that my husband had come to visit the set, and one by one, they all rushed over to catch a glimpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's noble temperament was outstanding, even though he was not in the business circle but in the entertainment industry where handsome men were abundant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly appeared, and the entire crew was alarmed. Soon, the staff who were watching the excitement gathered one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, being looked at like this would have definitely annoyed Elliott with his temperament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Elliott was unexpectedly friendly. Despite knowing that so many people were watching him, he still smiled and winked at me. "I rarely come here, won't you show me around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, we have plenty of beautiful actresses in our crew. If you're interested, I can introduce you to them." I said with a smile, without a hint of jealousy in my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to be rumored with people in the entertainment industry anyway, so I was used to it and what I said came out naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did I know, my words made him instantly unhappy. He emphasized in a low voice, "I came here to see you, I'm not interested in other women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." He was so straightforward that I didn't know how to respond for a moment, so I could only mumble in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott approached and directly wrapped his arms around my waist in front of everyone. Then, he gestured for me to take him around the set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam stood in the crowd, looking dazed. It was evident that Elliott's relationship with me had greatly shocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably had no idea that Elliott was my legendary husband, so much so that his entire facial expression was blank, like a child who had been scared silly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have time to comfort him, after all, Elliott came to the set and we are a couple. On the surface, I still have to take care of his face, so I directly took him to meet the director and producer, and then symbolically took him around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like declaring sovereignty, Elliott was either circling my waist or holding my hand from beginning to end. Even during the gaps in conversation with the director, he never let go of my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The male actors in the crew, who usually love to surround me, dare not approach now. I don't know who quickly found out Elliott's identity. For a moment, everyone was overwhelmed by Elliott's aura, and the atmosphere of the whole crew began to become solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just about lunchtime when, after accompanying Elliott for a while, I saw someone coming in with a lunch box. I smiled and asked Elliott, "Do you want to try the crew's lunch box for lunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know, Elliott shook his head and said, "Deliver these boxed meals to the workers at the nearby construction site. I have already ordered gourmet cuisine from the Royal Taste, and it will be delivered shortly."</span></p></div>
