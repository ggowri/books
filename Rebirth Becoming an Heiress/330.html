        <h1>Chapter 330 He Appeared</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't </span><span>understand </span><span>what kind of confidence led her to make such a judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her smug expression, I was speechless. Suddenly, Quinn stepped forward and coolly chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Cole, are you a bit too self-assured? Not everyone is worth our time and effort to track down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn indirectly belittled Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before we became friends, I had been the target of his sarcasm many times. Now, it was Giselle's turn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle clearly didn't expect Quinn to speak in such a manner. Her face instantly turned sour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, she asked, "And who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't even know who I am, how can you have the audacity to claim Elliott is your boyfriend to your friends? As far as I know, Elliott's wife's last name is Mayers. Next time before you boast to your friends, put a little more thought into it. Don't get caught in your lies. It's embarrassing." Quinn deliberately spoke loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the bar's resident singer</span><span>s</span><span> had finished their performance, and the bar fell silent. His words drifted into the ears of every one of Giselle's friends present.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the shock was written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle clearly didn't expect Quinn to embarrass her like this publicly. Her face flushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, every word Quinn said was the truth. Elliott and I were still legally married. Giselle couldn't defend herself for a moment and could only stand there, feeling so embarrassed she wished she could disappear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words made me chuckle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but agree, "The fact that Elliott is married has long been public knowledge in Hoswich. Ms. Cole, </span><span>are you </span><span>flaunting your status as a home wrecker in front of your friends? I wonder how your parents raised you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately spoke loudly as well. I'm sure all her friends heard me loud and clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face was so red. Being exposed in public like this must have been unbearable for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she still defiantly looked at me and sneered, "Elliott and you getting divorced is just a matter of time. Your pride won't last long."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could respond to Giselle, Quinn had already positioned himself in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Even if Elliott gets divorced, it doesn't necessarily mean it's your turn. Ms. Cole, I suggest you show some restraint. Otherwise, if Elliott finds out you're tarnishing his reputation like this, I'm afraid you won't even be able to keep your job at Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Quinn put his arm around my shoulder. He probably didn't want me to be provoked by Giselle any further, so he tried to lead me away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Giselle was relentless. She suddenly raised her phone high and snapped a few pictures of me and Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You keep saying you're not divorced from Elliott yet, but here you are openly with another man in the middle of the night. I'll send these photos to Elliott now and let him see what kind of person you really are."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn heard Giselle threatening me and immediately turned around, shouting sternly at Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, by then, Giselle had already sent the photos she took to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her phone triumphantly and said, "Of course I dare! What, are you scared? No need to be afraid. After all, Elliott and her are about to get divorced soon. Maybe she'll soon truly belong to you!"</span></p></div>
