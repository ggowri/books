        <h1>Chapter 818: He's Provoked</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's shout yanked me out of Elliott's tender gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, cool!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hastily responded, instinctively standing up to fetch some water for Quinn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before I could even turn around, Elliott had already grabbed my hand:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have Jane pour for him, you stay here with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still spoke in a commanding tone, an undeniable air of habitual dominance lacing his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm really parched. That white wine was too strong. My throat is so dry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was gradually closing in. Before I could react, my other hand was already seized by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I swiveled around, only to be met with his bewildered gaze. His eyes, bloodshot and desperate, were locked onto mine, his face etched with longing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinking feeling hit me... A drunk Quinn was far from the rational being he was when sober.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm off to pour it for you right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I wanted to break free from their grasp and fetch some water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to, but Elliott held my hand tightly. All the while, his gaze was fixed on Quinn, who was holding my other hand, a dark expression on his face."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, I signaled for Quinn to let go. However, Quinn showed no intention of loosening his grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He eyed Elliott with the same wary gaze. It was as if he was daring Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere started to get weird.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was sandwiched between two people, unsure of what to do next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've poured the water. Mr. Woods, have a drink, will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Jane came over with a glass of water at that moment, saving me from the awkward situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, thanks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn wasn't so drunk as to completely lose his senses. Despite his irritation, he let go of my hand, took the cup of water from Jane, and sat down to drink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, rose to his feet. He gripped my hand, his voice icy as he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come, accompany me to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I just tell you? We're short on rooms here, so you'll have to bunk with Barry, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily defended myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no sense in a married couple living apart. It's okay for Barry to sleep in the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott became stubborn, insisting on dragging me into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Barry has to drive tomorrow. Elliott, cut it out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized he meant business, and in a panic, I tried to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to sleep apart from you, nor am I used to having someone else by my side."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott was incredibly stubborn, persistently dragging me back into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Elliott! When will you stop being so stubborn?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was in a bind, Quinn suddenly slammed the table. He shot up from his chair, and without a word, he barked at Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he yanked me hard, abruptly severing the connection between Elliott's hand and mine. In an instant, I found myself whisked behind Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face was as cold as ice, his tone chillingly stern:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what the hell are you up to? Madeline is my woman. How long are you planning to covet her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your woman? Elliott, you guys broke up ages ago! Are you pretending to have amnesia? You're just using it as an excuse to keep Madeline by your side! Don't think I don't know! I just didn't want to call you out on it!"</span></p></div>
