        <h1>Chapter 125 Furious</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott drove me towards Serenity Villa, and the thought of spending the night in the same room with him made me feel a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want to go to Serenity Villa tonight, can you take me back to my parents' house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott obviously didn't notice my emotions, he didn't understand what was going on, and asked me impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had to go to the company for a meeting tomorrow morning, and Serenity Villa is too far away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used work as an excuse, just so that he wouldn't see how much I cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Toby can come over earlier to take you to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, however, clearly did not want me to go back to my parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really didn't like living in Serenity Villa, can you please respect my opinion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An inexplicable irritability rose from the bottom of my heart, and I restrained myself, trying to speak as calmly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to do everything possible to live in Serenity Villa before, why don't you like it now? Do you not like Serenity Villa, or do you not like being with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott slowed down the car, turned his head, and gave me a questioning look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody liked it... The house was not a place of happiness for me, and he was not the person who loved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't say it directly, I just smiled helplessly and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was a bit tired, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly parked the car by the roadside, turned his head, frowned, looked at me, and asked:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, why were you tired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked directly into his deep eyes, suddenly feeling powerless and unsure of how to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days he was very kind to me, giving me almost an illusion that he might gradually start liking me, caring about me, and falling in love with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle only appeared for a moment and shattered my illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furthest distance in this world is probably right now, when I am by his side, but he can never fall in love with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a sad thing it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people don't have to do anything and can easily get everything they want, while I, after making every effort, may only receive his affirmation of me as his wife, rather than love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, this kind of girl, would be the type you liked, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit. My mental defense line suddenly collapsed. I knew very well that I shouldn't ask such a silly question, but against my better judgment, I still asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any surprise, Elliott heard my words and first looked astonished, then mockingly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did it again, Madeline. Is it that in your mind, every woman who appears in front of me, I will like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my God, he actually questioned me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he really not understand himself enough, or did he himself not figure out what he really wanted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I had already asked that stupid question, I then asked an even more idiotic question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, with other women, you were just playing around, but Giselle, you truly loved her, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just finished speaking when he suddenly punched heavily on the steering wheel in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accidentally hit the car horn, and instantly a piercing high-decibel horn sound startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that such a simple question would make him so furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice suddenly turned cold, and at the same time, on his face, I saw that familiar impatience. Yes, it was the same disdain and annoyance he had shown me many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, based on your behavior during this period, I thought you had changed. I thought you now knew how to be a good wife. However, I realized that people cannot change their nature. You are still the same, jealous and suspicious. Whenever any woman appears by my side, you suspect me of cheating. Even with Giselle, you still have doubts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Giselle, you would still doubt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage caused by this sentence to me was really enormous!</span></p></div>
