        <h1>Chapter 274 The Mysterious Gentleman</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey gorgeous, care to join me for a drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was deep and resonant, leaving me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that the man who had been sitting silently in the corner, like a statue, would have a voice so similar to Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he be Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that was impossible, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving aside the fact that Elliott never deigned to attend such costume parties, even if he did, he wouldn't play second fiddle to Philip. Wherever he went, he was always the star of the group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he hadn't contacted me in the past two weeks. Surely, his parents or grandparents must be giving him a lot of pressure. How could he possibly have the time to attend such a costume party?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, I instinctively felt that he couldn't be Elliott. Based on what I know about Elliott, he would never initiate conversations with women, so how could the man who asked me to have a drink with him be Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but you'll have to give me a reason to join you for a drink."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The justification I came up with allowed me to relax and I asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the mask, I couldn't see his expression at all. He simply picked up the two glasses of wine in front of him and handed one to me without hesitation, his voice calm yet seductive,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think you're the most special among all the girls. How about that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was exactly like Elliott's, causing my heart to race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the damned black robe was too loose, obscuring his figure completely. Therefore, I couldn't determine if he was Elliott or just a random stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This party was organized by Quinn. Logically, if Elliott was here, Quinn would definitely know, and he would surely tell me about it. Thinking about it this way, I became more convinced that the man in front of me couldn't be Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reason accepted, and I'll drink this glass with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel a strong curiosity about this man, whose voice resembled Elliott's. So, I raised the glass and clinked it with his, then immediately downed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me finish the drink, he didn't hesitate either, lifting his glass and finishing his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sound a lot like someone I know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the drink, I looked at him and said tentatively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the eerie and dim lighting at the party, I couldn't see his eyes clearly for a moment. But upon hearing my words, he suddenly leaned closer, whispering lowly in my ear, "Is that so? Then who do you think I am?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone and demeanor were exactly like Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the man sitting next to me was really him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down my spine, and at that moment, I had a strong urge to remove the mask from his face.</span></p></div>
