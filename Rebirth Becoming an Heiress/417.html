        <h1>Chapter 417 Moving</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After browsing Twitter for a while, I decided to close it down. Then, I asked the taxi driver to take me to my parents' old villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of unsettling incidents here lately made me realize that the security measures around this place, where I had lived for decades and where my parents had spent almost their entire lives, were woefully inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our family was in turmoil. Just as my father had finally regained consciousness, there were already people plotting against us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I didn't know who sent that shadowy figure, this incident strengthened my resolve to move away from here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, we had invested in some properties in Hoswich over the years. It was just that my parents were sentimental and had been reluctant to leave this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called my mother to discuss this. I briefly explained last night's situation to her, and she was also taken aback. Then, we decided to temporarily move to the apartment near Glory Group, which had been vacant for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apartment was a two-story loft with decent surroundings and excellent security. It was initially supposed to be the gift my parents prepared for me when I married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I had lived in Serenity Villa since we married, so&nbsp;the apartment had been sitting idle.&nbsp;It had not been rented or sold in the past few years, but&nbsp;it had been&nbsp;taken care of by dedicated people.&nbsp;We chose that place because of the&nbsp;good&nbsp;greenery in the area, including a lake and an aerobic forest, which was&nbsp;perfect for taking my father out for a stroll and breathing in some fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I made the decision, I immediately called the moving company to pack up the daily necessities from the old villa and transport them there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took me two full days to clear out the old house and settle everything in the new one. Then, I prepared to go to Bryant Hospital to handle my father's discharge procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother had been staying at the hospital, never leaving my father's side, taking care of him every step of the way. She told me that since my father regained consciousness, he had been improving day by day and could even speak now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I arrived at Bryant Hospital and pushed open the door to my father's ward, I heard my mother and father talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as my father saw me, he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his weak arm, trying to wave at me. But perhaps due to just waking up, his arm barely made it halfway before it fell weakly back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I could feel his overwhelming love for me in his eager gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed over and grabbed his hand, unable to hold back my choked voice as I exclaimed, "Dad, you're finally awake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and your mom have been through a lot during this time," Austin said slowly. His speech was still weak, and his words were not very clear. But he was clearly conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Austin finished speaking, Lily immediately took over. "Your dad suddenly started speaking last night. I stayed up with him all night, telling him everything that happened. He said he's grateful for you. Otherwise, who knows what would've happened to Glory Group by the time he woke up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my mother finished speaking, she looked at me with relief. The three of us couldn't help but exchange glances, and at that moment, we all smiled involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you've really grown up."</span></p></div>
