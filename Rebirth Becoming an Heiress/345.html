        <h1>Chapter 345 Open the Door Automatically</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel... If I remembered correctly, this person would become popular in the film and television industry in the next two years. Just like Audrey, both of them would become A-list stars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jezebel was unknown at that time. How could he suddenly decide to use Jezebel?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. Which TV station are they going to premiere on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vague anger suddenly rose in my heart. Elliott did actually set up such a big scheme without letting out any information.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like us. They are negotiating with Netflix about the prime time. I guess they plan to broadcast their drama right after our show..." Adam said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I interrupted him directly before he finished his words. "It is obvious that they want to compete with us. We must disrupt their plan!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was startled by my decision. He looked at me with hesitation and finally, he asked, "But isn't Elliott your husband? Do you mean you want to have a war with him in business? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In business, we must be well prepared to fight with anyone. Since they plan to compete with us, we should compete with them too," I watched Adam and said solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I get it! Mrs. Bryant! Don't worry, I wouldn't let their dream come true. " Adam immediately understood how to lay out the plan. He took my order and left my office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's call came at this time. The name "Elliott" on the screen made me feel angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the phone angrily and heard a very magnetic and gentle voice. "Honey, are you still busy? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart would melt when he called me like this in normal times. But now I just was angry. "I'm not busy now. What else do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately noticed my mood from my words. "What's wrong? Why do you treat me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut through to the point," I said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am waiting for you downstairs in the Glory Group. Lily said the meal was ready and asked me to take you back to eat," he said in a deep voice without any emotion in his tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." I suddenly remembered that my mother went back home to cook dishes. So I carried my bag and went downstairs. As I walked out of the door, I saw Elliott putting one of his hands in the pocket and leaning on his car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His handsome and elegant appearance coupled with the white Porsche behind him indeed made him paralleled with any popular youngsters in the entertainment industry today. But at this moment, I had no time to appreciate him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He initiatively opened the car door for me, and I got into the car angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed my angry mood. So he immediately reached over his hands to pinch my face after I got into the car. "What's wrong? Why are you so angry all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to look at him. As he looked innocent, I tried my best to suppress my inner anger and pretended to be calm and asked him, "Is there anything you have lied to me?"</span></p></div>
