        <h1>Chapter 444 Being Groveling</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's child would forever become the wall between me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been confirmed Elliott was the biological father of that child. No matter how Giselle did it, it was a dead issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing could be changed, and there was no room for maneuvering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You make me, right?" Elliott showed distress on his face. He weakly and bitterly smiled. Suddenly, he approached me, saying with a little hoarse voice, "How could you be so indifferent all of a sudden? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was bustling with people here. We were also downstairs at Glory Group, so there were a lot of employees passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being pressed against the car by him in public, I felt embarrassed and awkward. So, I attempted to push him away, but he didn't let me go. Instead, he held me tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward to press me against the car. I could clearly feel my lower abdomen being squeezed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been before, I would definitely be oblivious. But now, I have a baby in my belly, so I was afraid that something would go wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became so anxious that I couldn't help shouting,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, that's it. Can you let me go? I have made it very clear! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing him as hard as I could, I struggled out from under him and walked forward subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he suddenly grabbed me and locked me tightly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I told you that I couldn't let go of you. You can't use other's mistakes to punish me. This is not fair! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's breath sprayed in my ear. I could feel his strong heartbeat through his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped my waist tightly with his hands, and his lips came closer to my earlobe. Then, he begged with a hoarse voice,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not get divorced, okay? Madeline, if you don't divorce me, I can agree to whatever you want. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt sour after hearing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen him look so groveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had begged me in this way before, I would have shaken involuntarily. No matter how strong a wall I built in my mind, he could easily push it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I instantly become hard-hearted after thinking about my child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would rather choose to divorce starting a new life with my children than be trapped in this triangle relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have decided. Elliott, we have no chance anymore as long as that child is alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I forcefully pulled his arms away from my waist. He resisted with all his might but in vain. Finally, he had to let go of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to walk forward firmly because I didn't want him to see my weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam stood still. Seeing me get rid of Elliott, he immediately ran forward and helped me. Then, he asked in a low voice,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you OK? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head. With Adam's help, I quickly got into his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam took me away quickly. While Adam turned around, I saw Elliott standing still motionlessly through the rearview mirror. He seemed to be shrouded in huge loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what he was thinking at that moment, but I didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I suddenly felt that the air around me was getting thinner and thinner. I had a blackout for no reason. Soon, I lost consciousness.</span></p></div>
