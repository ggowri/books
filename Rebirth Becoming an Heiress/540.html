        <h1>Chapter 540 Encounter Giselle Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me coming out of the B-ultrasonic room, Giselle visibly paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, looking at Jessica, who was graceful and elegant by my side, Giselle was even more astonished. A cunning light flashed in her dim eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately patted her large belly and immediately folded the ultrasound report in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you here for infertility treatment again?" Before I could speak, she aggressively asked, her tone reeking of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I eyed her designer suit and the Hermes bag slung over her shoulder, unable to conceal a hint of disdain. "The Bryant family has its private hospital. Why do you still like to come to public hospitals for treatment? Could it be that there's something wrong with the baby in your belly?" I asked, knowingly provoking her. My words made Jessica pause in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upper circle of Hoswich was not large, and although I didn't talk much about my past with Jessica, I assumed she must have heard something in this circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively whispered to me, "Is this Elliot's wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked this, obviously already knowing something. I had nothing to hide, so I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica's heart was as kind as Quinn's. After confirming with me, she immediately took the initiative to affectionately hold my hand and then smiled at Giselle, saying, "Miss, please be respectful. Madeline has just conceived. Don't talk nonsense when you're pregnant. You should accumulate virtues for your baby. Don't be so careless with your words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jessica said this, Giselle's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at me, then at Jessica, then glanced at my belly. Her expression changed dramatically, clearly showing extreme shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline is your son's wife? She's pregnant? How is that possible? And who are you?" Giselle blurted out a series of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she never expected that someone diagnosed with infertility like me could become pregnant. Moreover, I had divorced Elliott and remarried so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Giselle and intentionally taunted her. "In this world, nothing is impossible. If even you can get pregnant with Elliott's child, why can't I get pregnant with someone else's child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle suddenly felt unsteady on her feet. She held her stomach and walked up to me, her gaze alert as she stared at me, as if she realized something. "Madeline, are you really pregnant? How long have you been pregnant? Let me see your report!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she reached out to snatch the report from my hand, but as her hand reached out, Jessica immediately slapped it away and sternly said, "What are you doing? Stay away from Madeline. She's pregnant now. Can you afford any mishaps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Jessica protect me like this, Giselle reluctantly withdrew her hand. She scrutinized Jessica up and down. Although she didn't know Jessica's identity yet, she probably guessed from her appearance that she was either rich or noble. For a moment, envy appeared in Giselle's eyes.</span></p></div>
