        <h1>Chapter 666 Farewell</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me and took a deep breath. Notice my anxiety, he suddenly laughed and stroked my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just teasing you, wanting to see what your reaction would be... I never expected you to be so afraid of me falling in love with you. Madeline, why are you so timid now? Where did your courage to pursue Elliott go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sudden burst of laughter made me realize that he had just been teasing me. For a moment, I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also laughed and reached out to give his arm a hard pinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! You are joking about something like this. Back then... You even said it yourself, that was back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and sighed. When I thought back to those days, sometimes even I was confused about what exactly supported me to have a one-sided crush on Elliott for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current mindset, it was absolutely impossible for me to throw myself into danger like I used to. Perhaps, this was just how people were. Once bitten by a snake, they would fear the rope for ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let anyone destroy your expectations of love. No matter what age you are, what you're going through, or whether you've had any emotional experiences, the people who love you will still love you as before, so don't be discouraged. Don't lose hope in life, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn reached out and touched my hair, his gentle voice carrying a hint of magnetism, especially in his trailing tones, like encouragement and indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, if it weren't for meeting Elliott, it would be hard for me to refuse a man like Quinn, who was by my side and always cared for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, perhaps in those years, I loved a man too crazily. Today, I was calm and seemed to view love very lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we almost there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to continue discussing this topic with Quinn, so I quickly interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just ahead. Turn the corner, and you'll be there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn nodded. Immediately, he also tacitly remained silent and accelerated the speed, driving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, we arrived at the funeral site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we stepped in, a heavy atmosphere immediately overwhelmed us. We arrived a little later, so inside it was already crowded with people who came to bid </span><span>farewell to Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood solemnly at the door, welcoming everyone's arrival. When he saw me enter, there was a glimmer of light in his eyes, but it extinguished when he saw Quinn following closely behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A person cannot be brought back to life. Please accept my condolences and adapt to the changes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly watched him and gently comforted him with a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me for a few seconds before nodding slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many people at the scene. We didn't have much communication. After bowing to the body together with Quinn, I quickly stood at the back of the crowd and waited quietly, ready to bid farewell to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stayed by my side, never leaving me alone, for fear that my return to the Bryant family's place would cause unnecessary conflicts or affect my mood. He would occasionally engage in conversation with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from emotional communication, in fact, Quinn and I really have no secrets in other aspects, and he always accurately guesses my thoughts, knowing what I want to talk about. So, with him around, I have never been neglected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was what Elliott couldn't achieve.</span></p></div>
