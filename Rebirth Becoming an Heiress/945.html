        <h1>Chapter 945 Changing the Situation</h1>
        <div><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa noticed me at that moment, and the smile on her face subconsciously became stiff, and it took her several seconds to adjust her facial expression and say:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I thought ......Elliott was here alone, I didn&#x27;t think you were there.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">If she was only releasing hostility towards me before, then at this moment I could already clearly feel her hostility towards me.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She didn&#x27;t even bother to address me with a simple title, only using a &#x27;you&#x27; instead.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I accompanied Elliott here, it just so happens that we have a career in medicine nowadays, and it&#x27;s good to get to know some more experts in this circle. What, Ms. Fox doesn&#x27;t welcome me?&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">I asked rhetorically with a smile.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa probably realized that she had lost her temper, she adjusted the expression on her face once again and her voice went up a few notches:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;How come, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s all a bunch of guys today, I thought ......Ms. Mayers wouldn&#x27;t be much interested in attending.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No it won&#x27;t, isn&#x27;t Ms. Fox there? You&#x27;d be bored with a bunch of guys all by yourself, just so you have me to keep you company.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">I shot back with a light laugh.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Also, saves them from having to fill me up all the time, so I have an extra person to help me out. Let&#x27;s go inside, this way!&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa smiled with her fox eyes arched up, an imperceptible wryness crossing the corners of her eyes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I won&#x27;t let Madeline drink tonight, she&#x27;s not long after giving birth and can&#x27;t drink alcohol yet.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elliott was actually overbearingly protective of me as he wrapped his arms around my waist in front of Lisa and led me past Lisa to take the lead into the diner.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I didn&#x27;t turn around to see Lisa&#x27;s reaction, I only vaguely felt as if two gazes were staring at me like arrows behind me.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elliott embraced me through the long corridor of the restaurant, and then we walked into the innermost box.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The box was already full of people, and it was indeed full of drug experts in suits.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, due to the strength of the Bryant Group in Hoswich City, Elliott, although younger than them, stood up and greeted them as he arrived and invited him to sit at the head of the table.</p><p class="MsoNormal">There was only one empty seat next to Elliott, and, apparently, it was originally reserved by Lisa for herself.</p><p class="MsoNormal">However, I pretended not to be aware of this and accompanied Elliott to his seat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We had just sat down when Lisa pushed open the door to the booth, and as she watched me sit down next to Elliott, her face crumbled once again, and she managed to squeeze out a small smile:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I didn&#x27;t realize Ms. Mayers would be accompanying Mr. Bryant, so I only left two empty seats. Waiter, you guys help me add another seat for me next to that lady, and we&#x27;ll sit together as two girls.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa had someone add a seat for her next to me, and then she took a seat next to me.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I didn&#x27;t know why she chose to sit next to me, but the moment she sat down, I seemed to feel a gust of wind blowing, and goosebumps appeared all over my body.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I couldn&#x27;t help but think that she would be able to do compulsion, and my heart was filled with defenses.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, I have the last time to let someone specifically for me to match the medicine, I have always brought in the bag ......</p></div>
