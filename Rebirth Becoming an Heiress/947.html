        <h1>Chapter 947 Bravely Being Yourself</h1>
        <div><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I really didn&#x27;t expect that the president of Glory Group Group turned out to be such a young and outstanding woman, Ms. Mayers, I&#x27;ve heard of your name.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Yes, Ms. Mayers is too low-key, if not for Mr. Bryant&#x27;s introduction, we wouldn&#x27;t have thought that you are so young and beautiful that you are in charge of such a big group of companies, you really can&#x27;t just look at the face.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Ms. Mayers, it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you, this is my business card, I hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with you.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Ms. Mayers, this is my business card, I am ......&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">......</p><p class="MsoNormal">In an instant, these experts who had just treated me with some contempt greeted me, and after the first person handed me his business card, everyone got up and took the initiative to hand over their business cards with me.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It took me a while to complete the pleasantries and socializing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The hard power behind me made it so that I didn&#x27;t have to say much to overshadow Lisa.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I became the main attraction of the meal, while she, who had just been selling out, was left out in the cold.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I had a great time interacting with these drug experts who offered to toast me.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Elliott took pity on my body and he straight up blocked the drinks for me, telling everyone that I was not fit to drink.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I sipped my drink and watched them drink.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I realized that even though it was the first time I had accompanied Elliott on a business engagement, it was far easier with him by my side than it was when I was on my own.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa was very animated for the first half of the evening and then went off like a dud for the second half.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She sat next to me, and I caught a glimpse of her hand with my afterimage, and she kept pinching her thighs hard, all the while keeping that stiff smile on her face.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This contest made me suddenly understand that when a woman reaches a certain age, she never relies on her appearance and figure to earn a win, but rather, she relies on her own hard power in order to gain enough respect on social occasions, so that she doesn&#x27;t have to pander to men, and she can also occupy a certain position on the social scene.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Although the whole evening of socializing was indeed exhausting, I hadn&#x27;t felt this happy in a long time. More and more, I find that sometimes doing something incredibly challenging is much more interesting than being an ordinary woman.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Feeling increasingly moved, I couldn&#x27;t help but take out my phone and share the story of tonight with two of my three best friends. Paige and Fiona were amused by my description, and the three of us ended up complaining about Lisa in the group chat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After reading their responses, I burst out laughing, which caught the attention of Elliot, who was driving beside me. As we waited at a red light, he glanced over:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Madeline, you&#x27;ve really changed. You used to always consider my feelings in everything you did, afraid to show yourself in front of me, worried about making me upset. But look at you now, laughing freely in front of me, expressing yourself without a care about how I might see you.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I used to care too much about others, and the more I cared, the less I knew what to do. It&#x27;s different now. I prioritize my own feelings. I just want to make myself happy and don&#x27;t care much about what others think of me. If someone upsets me, I retaliate. If this makes you uncomfortable, I&#x27;m sorry, but I won&#x27;t change myself for you,&quot; I said calmly, feeling unburdened.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No, I prefer the way you are now. This is the real you. Just be yourself. You don&#x27;t need to change or compromise for anyone. Those who understand you will naturally appreciate you,&quot; Elliot quickly shook his head, looking at me deeply, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As he drove, he couldn&#x27;t help but lift a hand to gently stroke my hair. I couldn&#x27;t help but smile and wink at him.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Although some things haven&#x27;t been completely resolved yet, I&#x27;ll leave the future to time. What I should focus on is the present.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;You&#x27;re right, I should continue like this. Now, let&#x27;s go home.&quot;</p></div>
