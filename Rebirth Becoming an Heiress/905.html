        <h1>Chapter 905 He Wants to Talk</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I returned home with a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I opened the door, my parents and Malina were in the living room with Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's fever </span><span>was brought down</span><span>. He was lying in his stroller, and my parents were pushing him around the living room to keep him entertained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once quiet house was now filled with joy because of a </span><span>baby</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed a corner of the room filled with unopened toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't need to ask to know that </span><span>Quinn </span><span>had bought them for Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how good he had been to me, my parents, and Noah, I felt a complex mix of emotions, including a deep sense of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over and played with Noah along with my parents for a while, then got ready to head to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my mom asked me to go to her room </span><span>for a talk</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that th</span><span>is</span><span> morning's </span><span>coincidence</span><span> </span><span>was</span><span> still on her mind, so I nodded and followed her to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom closed the door, looked at me, and sighed:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I don't know what to say. How could you get involved with </span><span>Elliott</span><span> again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I have my reasons. It's not what you think..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to explain everything to her in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my explanation, my mom sighed heavily again, then patted my shoulder and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, no matter what</span><span> happened</span><span>, I don't want you getting involved with him again. The past is the past. You need to move on with your life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, </span><span>Laura </span><span>knows about Noah. She's not easy to deal with. If they find out Noah is their </span><span>grandson</span><span>, </span><span>we</span><span> won't have any peace. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't tell your dad about this morning, but I hope you can draw a clear line with </span><span>Elliott</span><span> for Noah's sake. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We only have one daughter, and now we have Noah. Your dad and I finally have something to look forward to in our old age. We don't want anyone taking this precious </span><span>baby</span><span> from us. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course I understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Noah came into our lives, my parents had been up early and staying up late, often rushing to the nursery first thing in the morning and lingering there at night, reluctant to leave his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially my dad, who treated Noah like a treasure, afraid to let him out of his sight. He was now full of energy, as if he had endless strength, and was filled with hope for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. No one will take Noah from you. I promise. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm planning to </span><span>buy</span><span> a house in Australia. I'm having someone look into it. Once </span><span>it&rsquo;s settled</span><span>, I'll get the visas for you and Dad, and you can take Noah there. This way, Laura Bryant won't be able to bother you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said this to reassure my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad and I are old, and we're not keen on moving to a foreign country where we don't know anyone. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Noah's sake, we'll do anything. You</span><span> can make the call</span><span>. Just remember, don't </span><span>put things off </span><span>with Quinn. We all see how much he cares for you and Noah. If you miss this chance, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom reminded me again. I knew she had already considered </span><span>Quinn </span><span>as her future son-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise</span><span>,</span><span> the lady at the breakfast shop wouldn't kno</span><span>w</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, Mom. I'll handle my own affairs. You just take care of Noah. If there's nothing else, I'll head to work now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I </span><span>gave</span><span> </span><span>a plain answer and an excuse</span><span>, afraid she would </span><span>continue lecturing</span><span>. I quickly grabbed my bag and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life has a way of bringing you what you fear most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I escaped </span><span>from </span><span>my mom, Laura Bryant blocked me at the entrance of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in a hurry to get to work and tried to avoid her, but she spread her arms and stood in my way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> she has now completely changed her previous arrogant attitude and become much humble</span><span>r</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, listen. </span><span>Jasper </span><span>hasn't been feeling well lately and is currently </span><span>treated</span><span> in the hospital. He really wants to see you and has some things to say to you in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura came again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already in a bad mood, and now she had to come and bother me too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I've said before that </span><span>Noah</span><span> has nothing to do with the Bryant family, and there's no need for us to meet. Laura, instead of wasting time here with me, you should think of ways for </span><span>Elliott</span><span> to </span><span>carry on </span><span>your family </span><span>lineage </span><span>while he's still young."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed her aside and was about to leave, but Laura clung tightly to my sleeve:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you know Elliott. If we could </span><span>convince</span><span> him, we wouldn't be in this situation. I'm begging you, okay? Please come to the hospital with me to see my husband, just</span><span> for</span><span> once, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I&rsquo;m busy. There&rsquo;s </span><span>a meeting</span><span> waiting for me</span><span>. I don't have the time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely annoyed and repeatedly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, </span><span>Laura </span><span>suddenly dropped to her knees with a thud</span><span> when she saw that I wouldn't agree</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, if you don't </span><span>want to </span><span>go to the hospital to see my husband today, I'll stay here</span><span> and won&rsquo;t get up</span><span>. After all, I'm your elder and was once your mother-in-law. Can you really bear to see me kneeling here </span><span>forever</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my </span><span>response</span><span>, Laura resorted to her usual dramatic tactics again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, feeling both helpless and speechless, while a crowd began to gather around us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea what her real motive was for insisting I go to the hospital to see her husband so early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does your husband want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, feeling somewhat exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll know when you get there. Madeline, please </span><span>just go to</span><span> see him, just once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing a slight change in my tone, Laura immediately grabbed my sleeve and pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the time instinctively... With her delaying me like this, our scheduled meeting had already passed its start time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Laura</span><span> pretty </span><span>well. If I didn't agree, she might really stay here all day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I </span><span>had to</span><span> agree to her request:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me agree, Laura stood up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed </span><span>her</span><span> to Bryant Hospital. In the top-tier private ward, I saw Jasper Bryant in a hospital gown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me, the usually reserved Jasper surprisingly showed a warm smile and gestured for me to come closer...</span></p></div>
