        <h1>Chapter 699 Talk Alone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have a chat alone," he said, grabbing my hand again. Before I could react, he forcefully pulled me and dragged me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, Mr. Bryant..." Marcus called out urgently from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, there is still so much food left. They don't want to eat, let's eat it ourselves. Don't worry, sit down and eat slowly," Barry's voice came from behind, clearly indicating that Marcus was stopped by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing?" I once again tried to break free from Elliott's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he held on tightly and wouldn't let go, pulling me toward the exit. In this way, he dragged me all the way to his car and pushed me directly into the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lost my balance and fell onto the back seat, and Elliott leaned over to discuss something, pressing me against the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him with anger all over my face. I was about to speak when suddenly he punched the back of the chair. I was startled, and my eyelids couldn't help but tremble for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not working. That is not working. What do I have to do for you to fall in love with me again?" he finally couldn't pretend anymore, gritting his teeth, he asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up and met his angry eyes. "No matter what you do, Elliott, I said it, I won't fall in love with you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me without saying a word. His chest heaved heavily, his Adam's apple moved, and his hand slowly moved toward my chest. In his eyes, there was clearly a mixture of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This look was very familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when we were deeply in love, every time he desired me, it was with such a look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for my pregnancy now, I'm afraid he would not be able to resist eating me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott is now starting to scare me more and more, feeling unpredictable and unfathomable. I don't know what he was so fixated on and what he was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just wanted to stay away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled instinctively, but he held me down, not speaking and not allowing me to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stood there like that for a while, and finally, he eventually let go of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped for breath as I sat up, feeling the impulse in him gradually fading away. The </span><span>tension in my heart, which I had been holding, also eased. I said lightly, "We are all adults now, it's better to part ways amicably. There's really no need for all this. Instead of salvaging anything, it only erases the little bit of beauty we had in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing things to happen, there was simply no happiness at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is such a simple truth. I believe Elliott would not fail to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know what happened with Giselle completely broke your heart, but I never had any intimate contact with her from the beginning to the end. I didn't betray you, why are you unwilling to go back to the past with me?" He sat up, forcefully loosening his tie, feeling a mix of frustration and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter if there was betrayal or not, what matters is that I no longer love you, Elliott," I calmly reiterated the fact to him once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that my tone like this would be enough to make him see the truth and choose to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I used to be able to make you fall in love with me, and I still can now." Unexpectedly, Elliott was determined, despite knowing my attitude, he insisted on trying again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you think you were very shameless like this now?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I can't get, others can't get either," Elliott looked at me, with a competitive look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to become enemies, don't we? Elliott, I didn't want to become enemies with you, but if you insist on it, then you're forcing me to leave Hoswich city!" I felt a dull pain in my chest, filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leaving?" Elliott didn't care, instead he smiled and said, "You won't leave, you can't let go of Glory Group, let alone your parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he knew me well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really laughed out loud, looking at the Elliott in front of me who was gradually becoming unfamiliar. I couldn't help but shake my head and asked him, "Elliott, have you ever calculated how many years I liked you, and why did I like you so much in the past?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words caused Elliott's expression to suddenly freeze, and he stood there in a daze, clearly not expecting me to ask him this all of a sudden.</span></p></div>
