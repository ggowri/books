        <h1>Chapter 250 Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving my compliment, Rowan appeared somewhat bashful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly set down the lunch box and then said, "Madeline, you've been standing for a while. How about coming to my office for a bit? It's a bit messy with all the ongoing cases, but you're welcome to hang out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan's workplace was a bustling office, with everyone working together in a shared office space, leading to a clutter of various documents on the desks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, we don't want to distract you from your work. I'll just wander around with my friend," I replied with a smile, gesturing for Rowan to attend to his duties.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, Fiona and I strolled off in another direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis' law firm was quite accommodating, with not only office spaces but also a staff gym and meeting rooms for client discussions, along with a small coffee bar for employees to relax.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I led Fiona into the coffee bar, and after each of us brewed a cup of coffee, we settled down in a corner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coffee bar's corner was adorned with numerous green plants. The sunlight streaming in from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Basking in the sun on such a day was particularly enjoyable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona chuckled and asked me, "How do you know that guy we just met?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my assistant's college classmate. I recommended him for the job here," I replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see, no wonder he looked at you with such gratitude," Fiona </span><span>said</span><span>, taking a sip of her coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexis mentioned he's been doing quite well," I said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I took out my phone from my pocket, snapped a picture of Fiona, and then captured the greenery in the corner before posting on Instagram with the caption: [A delightful tea break.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the present moment's contentment, I shared the post without any ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I set my phone aside and engaged in casual conversation with Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona suddenly disclosed a secret during our conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige told me that one night, after a few drinks, she and Philip accidentally ended up sleeping in the same room."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shocked that I nearly spat out my coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What did you say? Paige and Philip slept together?" I exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my astonishment, Fiona nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hard to believe, right? Not only for me, but even Paige herself didn't anticipate it. She always saw Philip as a good friend, </span><span>but </span><span>that night, they ended up in the same bed, </span><span>she </span><span>completely bewildered when they woke up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily put down my coffee and asked, "How are they planning to deal with this? Are they just going to brush it off as an accident? I warned Paige before about her outspoken nature leading to potential </span><span>troubles</span><span>, advising her to be cautious. Yet, that's exactly what we're dealing with now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona furrowed her brow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how she's handling it. Paige</span><span> was </span><span>quite flustered. Since that night, Philip hasn't reached out to her, and she's unsure of his </span><span>thought</span><span>. But I discreetly </span><span>asked</span><span> Alexis, and it seems Philip's personal life is even more chaotic than Paige's. He hasn't had a stable girlfriend for years. I fear he might not take responsibility for Paige."</span></p></div>
