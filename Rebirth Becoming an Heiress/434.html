        <h1>Chapter 434 A Shattered Heart</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pressed his lips and stared at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "During that medical exam, they had Doctor Louis extract a sperm sample from me and had Giselle go through IVF. That's why my mother is so convinced the child Giselle is carrying is mine. Because it was all orchestrated by them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally revealed the facts he had uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, these facts were brutal for him to disclose. That was why he took so long to tell me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly stunned. I stared blankly at Elliott, so shocked I forgot to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that Cormac, Laura, and Jasper had started their covert actions back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nor did I expect Giselle, an unmarried woman, to choose such a painful method as IVF for the sake of carrying on the Bryant family legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was genuinely prepared to pay any price to marry into the Bryant family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions, which had been stable, surged unexpectedly upon hearing the truth Elliott revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed then that even if Elliott and Giselle hadn't had sex before, the child Giselle was carrying was undoubtedly his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, I successfully fended off Elliott's advances. Yet, this revelation shattered me in an instant, bringing me to the brink of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I congratulate you? Elliott, your wish to become a father has finally come true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared intently into his eyes, my heart breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline," Elliott murmured, "I know this truth is a tremendous blow to you. That's why I've been debating whether to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean you've known about this all along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to control my emotions, but my tone was unavoidably angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed Doctor Louis for answers and found a breakthrough. I only uncovered the truth recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott spoke slowly, his tone incredibly somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning weakly against the wall, I felt utterly drained. Unbidden, the image of the ultrasound Giselle had sent me surfaced in my mind, showing the tiny shape of the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a dagger had pierced my heart, cutting straight through and leaving a trail of imaginary blood flowing through my veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. You don't have to worry about your grandfather's regrets. The Bryant family won't be lacking descendants. It's okay, I can step aside for her anytime. Just set a date, and we can get the divorce papers sorted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, I slowly closed my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no longer any need for me to entangle myself with him or with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Cormac, Laura, and Jasper as I did, the child Giselle was carrying was a massive joy for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was now a hero in their eyes. No wonder Laura didn't bother to pretend anymore. She was eager to get me out of the Bryant family sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want to divorce you. Madeline, I can't be without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned deeply. Hearing my words, he nervously grabbed my icy hand and placed it against his burning chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was pounding fiercely, and his eyes reddened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could see the plea in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His desire to avoid divorce was so clear. Yet, I found everything absurdly ridiculous. I forcefully pulled my hand away, trying to organize my thoughts, which were already a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not get a divorce? Is that realistic? Elliott, after what the Bryant family has done, I have no choice but to facilitate this for you! After all, I'm the hen who can't lay eggs in your eyes," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a bitter, sarcastic laugh, even though my heart felt like it was bleeding.</span></p></div>
