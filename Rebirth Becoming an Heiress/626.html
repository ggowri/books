        <h1>Chapter 626 Siege on Laura</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had a great sense of pride. She shouted loudly, afraid that anyone would miss the news that they had a grandson. Laura was almost about to open a Champaign to celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still in place, watching Laura's direction with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I never had the opportunity to participate in these parties, nor did I know that Laura was actually a party enthusiast. Just like Grey, she enjoyed parties in Hoswich, and standing beside her was a group of old girlfriends who were of similar age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, congratulations! Your family finally has the long-awaited grandson. Now Mr. Bryant can finally rest assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, after Cormac heard this news, he became so excited that his appetite increased. Some people said that the arrival of this child would bring good luck to Cormac, maybe even help him overcome his difficulties and live to be 100," Laura proudly proclaimed in the crowd, as someone echoed in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words surprised me greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had clearly told me that Corma had been seriously ill and could pass away at </span><span>any moment. It was precisely because of this that Elliott had no choice but to let Giselle give birth to that child, to fulfill Corma's regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now I realize that what came out of Laura's mouth was not at all like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who, between the mother and son, in the end, spoke the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I didn't know what to think. And then, someone in the crowd laughed and said, "You already have a grandson, when are you planning to have your son engaged to that girl? We are all waiting to attend the engagement ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to think about carefully choosing a woman for my son. She must come from a respectable family with compatible looks and personality. But Cormac couldn't wait. There was no choice. Giselle was so lucky, she gave birth to a boy. Our family plans to celebrate the child's birth and their engagement ceremony together, so you all can come and join us then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's pretending to be willing to settle. But in reality, she smiled brightly, with wrinkles spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To have the birthday party and engagement ceremony together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that there was less than a month away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of the video in my hand and smiled. Looking at Laura, I couldn't help but imagine her breakdown after learning the truth on the day of the banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here? Why didn't tell me you've come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was daydreaming when Grey suddenly appeared by my side. She tapped my shoulder and startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Auntie</span><span> Grey, I've just arrived too. I thought you might be busy, so I stood here for a while," I said with a smile as soon as I saw Grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey, however, looked through everything in my eyes. She pinched my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You felt uncomfortable because you saw Laura showing off, right? She's not worth getting angry over. I think being with Quinn will make you a hundred times happier than being with the Bryant family! From what I can see, it's not your fault, but rather Laura's son having fertility issues, right? Otherwise, how could you start dating Quinn and immediately get pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey had always been involved in this circle. With the support of Benjamin and the powerful Woods family, she never needed to care about anyone's opinion. If she disliked someone, she directly confronted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately spoke loudly, with the purpose of making Laura hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as Grey finished speaking, Laura turned her head. When she saw me and Grey standing on the side, the smug smile on Laura's face immediately disappeared. She disdainfully looked down on us and coldly said, "Grey, don't think you can boast here just because of Benjamin and the Woods family. My son is in good health, and I just became a grandmother!"</span></p></div>
