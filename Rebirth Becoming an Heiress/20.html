        <h1>Chapter 20 Debate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I stood up and began to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I disagree with you. I think that the structure of Allure is too grand, the plot is overly complicated, and the love process between the male and female leads is not attractive. Moreover, it is difficult to produce. Because ordinary actors cannot portray the essence of the characters, and it will be expensive to invite renowned actors. Plus, this drama also has a hidden danger. According to the description of the project leader just now, there is a plot involving explosions. If mishandled, it may cause unnecessary losses and casualties. The Glory Group is primarily an industrial corporation, and it is her first foray into the video industry. I believe it would be more prudent to choose a low-budget drama first. Although Do Not Love is only about love and affection, its story is refreshing and its values are positive, which aligns with the thoughts of young people nowadays. I think this drama is more worthy of investing in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't stop until I finished expressing my opinion. The whole room fell into a silent state instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was the president's daughter, it was still my first day at work and the others did not know me well. Therefore, it was normal for them not to agree with my opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my gaze towards Austin, who at that time held absolute authority in the Glory Group. As long as he nodded, all problems would be resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and I locked eyes for a moment, and he then smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What Jade just said is right, and what Madeline said also makes sense. We all know that the Glory Group's funding has been severely reduced in the past two years, and we currently don't have much surplus money on hand. Therefore, I think it's not a bad idea to choose Do Not Love as a trial first..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had always been more conservative and cautious in investment, so he favored my opinion more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could finish speaking, his words were hastily interrupted by Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mayers, I don't think so. As a large company like the Glory Group ventures into the video industry for the first time, it is necessary to create momentum with high-cost dramas and attract people with big productions in order to maximize profits. Madeline has never had a job before and does not understand the operating rules of the industry. I believe her opinions are not worth considering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was obviously impatient and directly attacked me in the conference room. Her intense words made all the executives instantly silent, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting fell into a deadlock. However, for the sake of the Glory Group's future, no matter what, I could not agree to the Glory Group investing in Allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly glanced at Jade and then said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never had a job before, but I have watched a lot of TV dramas in recent years. If it's about other businesses, I may not have enough experience to speak, but when it comes to TV dramas, I definitely know more than you do. And I also know what young people prefer to watch. Dad, I think investing in Allure carries too much risk. Do Not Love is more suitable for the Glory Group to have a try first. And, if you agree, I am willing to take charge of this project until the drama is completed and enters the market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, the project leader in charge of Do Not Love also stood up. He once again expressed his views on this drama from a professional investment perspective. From an investment point of view, this drama did not have any investment risks and was obviously more suitable for the Glory Group at present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin fell into contemplation, and Jade, seeing that he did not express any opinion, stood up again, attempting to disrupt his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her impatient appearance, I recalled more details once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why this drama suffered heavy losses in the previous life was because Jade was the main person in charge of this drama. Later on, I found out that she made a lot of illicit money during the production process. Moreover, in order to satisfy her own desires, she even kept a male actor who participated in this drama as her lover. In order to please the male actor, she also provided him with a lot of resources behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glory Group's funds were already experiencing problems at that time. From any perspective, I would no longer sit idly by and allow Jade to manipulate everything.</span></p></div>
