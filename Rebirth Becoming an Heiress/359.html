        <h1>Chapter 359 Addiction</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. No one will come in without my order."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, had no qualms at all. He cupped my face and started sucking and biting down hard on my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmmm..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to protest again, but Elliott didn't give me any chance to make a sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept kissing my lips and rubbing my cheeks with the tip of his nose, which was filled with infinite flirtation. His voice sounded pretty slouchy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like you're poison and I'm addicted. What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My earlobes instantly went flushed. I subconsciously cover Elliott's mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? I can't understand a word you're saying."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled softly and lowered his head to kiss me on the lips once again. He kissed me so dominantly that it was as if his tongue was trying to fight with mine. After the teasing, it was followed by a seductive sucking of my tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Elliott wanted to suck me dry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only be forced to cater to it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the table, Elliott had already pressed his hand into my suit, and at that moment, I just felt as weak as a marshmallow about to melt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a dizzying feeling of sweetness and numbness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole office seemed to be a charming and luscious world. Everything was morphing, twisting and changing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of lust and passion was unexpectedly more and more exhilarating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As our bodies intertwined, it was as if I could hear the sound of bodies and souls on fire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as we had both fallen into each other, the door to Elliott's office was pushed open violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden noise startled both Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you? Who is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's cold voice rang through the office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed and scrambled to fix my messy clothes. I subconsciously dove into Elliott's arms, not daring to look at who it really was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me, your mother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Laura's voice suddenly came from the doorway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, her voice suddenly became harsh, coming from far to near.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't work during the day, but you're doing this in the office with this bitch, you're just like your father. Get out of the way! Let me see who this bitch is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have time to fix my hair before it was pulled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I saw Laura's noble face magnifying in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's eyes were wide, her eyes furious, like a shrew. However, when she realized it was me, she obviously froze. She asked, "Madeline, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, why are you here? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, my face had blushed to the extreme. I sat up in panic, quickly fixed my hair and clothes, and stammered, "What are you doing in the office? It's daytime."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura came back to her senses, and she was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another sound of footsteps came. I subconsciously turned around to find that it was Giselle again, standing in the doorway of the office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why are you suddenly at the office?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked angrily. By now he had already straightened his clothes, his face indifferent.</span></p></div>
