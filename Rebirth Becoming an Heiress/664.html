        <h1>Chapter 664 Don't Say It Aloud</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took over the post, and my mood became even heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I minded a lot about Cormac's actions back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he, as an elder, allow Giselle to undergo IVF and tolerate Laura's heartless act of kicking me out just because Elliott and I don't have a child yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he passed away. Upon hearing such news, I had a heavy mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll think about it," I said lightly. Then, I set the envelope aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what the purpose of sending me the obituary was. I had no idea if it was Elliott's idea or someone else's in the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they suddenly regret and want to mend their relationship with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt confused and also felt a bit ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't overthink it. Don't let insignificant people affect your mood. Our lives are all arranged by fate, so these things are just normal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the situation, Adam quickly comforted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew. Adam, how was that child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly thought of Giselle's child, who was still in the incubator, so I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That child was never the Bryant family's child, so naturally the Bryant family won't be involved anymore. I heard Giselle's parents took the child back from the hospital. I'm not sure what the child's current situation is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam said again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. You can go and do your own thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't ask any further questions. After adjusting my mood, I began to immerse myself in my work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I turned around the decline of Glory Group, Austin has been spending less and less time at the company and gradually transitioned all the power to me, while he devoted more time to accompany Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last weekend, Austin said that he planned to travel around the country with Lily to make up for the years he owed her. He intended to retire and hand over the company to me to steer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that, in the future, I would take more responsibilities for the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly immersed myself in the work, leaving behind all these annoying things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, I had almost forgotten that the Bryant family invited me to the funeral. While we had dinner, Quinn suddenly brought it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cormac Bryant's funeral is tomorrow, so are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't go. My identity was awkward, and besides, I didn't want to join in the fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly stunned and then remembered this matter. I immediately shook my head and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Elliott has been greatly affected these past few days, experiencing a high fever for two consecutive days. After regaining consciousness, his personality became very strange. Moreover, according to Philip, he kept calling out your name while he had a high fever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked into Quinn's eyes, my gaze calm and my tone unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His relationship with his grandfather was very good, so it's normal for him to be sad. However, whether he calls my name or not is no longer important. Quinn, do you want me to attend that funeral?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should respect the deceased. If you want to go, I'll accompany you. As for what Mr. Cormac Bryant did to you in the past, let's consider it as him being mentally impaired due to illness. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then let's go to the funeral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn persuaded me, and I immediately let go of the resentment in my heart and nodded in agreement.</span></p></div>
