        <h1>Chapter 267 Doctor</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was likely that Laura exerted pressure on me and should have communicated something to Elliott as well. It didn't take long before he sent another message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Ignore whatever my mother said. We can decide our own affairs.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attitude made me feel that he didn't desire a divorce, which left me both relieved and sorrowful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared blankly at the chat window, still not replying to his message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I needed some time to digest and be alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning lazily on the seat, I sat quietly in the service area for a long time. Finally, I decided to call Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, in order to get pregnant, I sought Fiona's advice and explored various methods. I faintly recalled her mentioning a retired doctor in Louis City who had a distinctive approach to treating female infertility. However, this doctor was selective and believed in fate. He only met those destined to cross paths with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Fiona took me to find him, but at that time, the doctor happened to be taken abroad by his children and had not returned yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when the doctor returned to the country, I had already divorced Elliott and been driven out of the Bryant Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, Elliott and I had taken such a rare turn for the worse. I was reluctant to be evicted by the Bryant family again. Regardless of the method, I had to try again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dialed Fiona's phone number. She asked on the other end of the phone, "Madeline, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I remember you saying that there was an older doctor in Louis City who had a special prescription for female infertility. Isn't that right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard my mentor talk about this expert. His last name is Cullen. He lives in a historic mansion in the old area of Louis City, but Dr. Cullen is hard to get an appointment with. Madeline, would you like to visit him?" Fiona asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Could you help me get his contact information? I happen to be in Louis City in the next few days, and I'd like to see if I can have that chance to meet Dr. Cullen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll look into it. I will send it to you after getting the details," Fiona readily agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up and took a deep breath. Then, I drove out of the service area and went straight to Louis City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving there, I went back to the flat Elliott had offered me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flat was the same as it was before he and I left. The black and white pair of couple slippers at the door were the ones we had bought when shopping in the supermarket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Elliott's presence, the large flat seemed extraordinarily empty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually cooked some spaghetti in the kitchen, but without much of an appetite, I ate a few bites of it randomly and threw it all away. Alone, I turned on my computer and began to sort through the emails and messages I had received over the past few days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The filming of Do Not Love was in its final stages, and it was estimated that all the scenes would be wrapped up in half a month.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the director and the cast chosen this time were more reliable, so all the filming went smoothly, and the costs were always within reasonable control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;I organized and filed a summary of all the work into a PowerPoint and emailed it directly to my dad as a conclusion to my first project with the Glory Group.&#8203;</span></p></div>
