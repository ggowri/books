        <h1>Chapter 605 Request an Abortion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, are you at work? Paige is at your hospital now. I think she's in a bit of a bad state. Come over quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had just finished the surgery. What did you say? What happened to Paige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this news, Fiona became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry to the emergency room. Hurry. Paige is not doing well. I can't explain everything," I said anxiously into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be there right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Fiona hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two minutes later, I saw Fiona rushing towards me from the other end of the corridor, wearing surgical attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pointed in the direction of the emergency room, and she immediately understood what I meant. Without saying a word to me, she pushed open the door and walked into the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Philip probably came to his senses. Seeing Fiona rushing in, he folded his hands praying, "Hope the baby is safe and sound...."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I got angry again and couldn't help but punch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You begin to worry about the child now? What were you doing just now? You were so close to Paige. Why didn't you protect her? Otherwise, that bitch wouldn't have hurt Paige and the child. If you don't love her, why are you with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I shouldn't have done that. I let Paige down. I'm sorry to our kid. I was wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I punched him, Philip did not resist but kept repenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's expression just now made him feel scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know you were wrong? Quinn and I tried our best to cover up for you because we didn't want you to hurt Paige and the child. But I never expected that you would still be with that bitch. Philip, you are so stupid!" I grabbed his collar and scolded him angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the door of the emergency room suddenly opened, and Fiona walked out from inside with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, how was Paige doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately let go of Philip and ran towards Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona looked at me sadly, her eyes filled with doubt and astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what just happened? What's going on exactly? Paige is refusing to cooperate with the rescue. She's asking the attending physician to give up on saving the baby inside her belly. She's requesting an abortion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, I was shocked and my eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked to hear that she requested an abortion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible? Paige loved her baby very much. For the kid, she had gone through a lot these past few months. Was she acting on impulse? How could she make </span><span>such a request?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Fiona's words, Philip was in a state of panic. He quickly said to Fiona, "Abortion? Impossible... Fiona, please go in and persuade her. Tell her I know I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona coldly glanced at Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must have been something you did to upset her. Otherwise, she wouldn't have made such a decision. She wants to see you. Change your clothes and come with me."</span></p></div>
