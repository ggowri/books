        <h1>Chapter 865: What If We Have a Child</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even met the kid yet, and she was already willing to part with her family's heirloom talisman. That truly caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, accepting this heirloom from the Bryant family would indirectly acknowledge that Noah is indeed a Bryant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the amulet in my hands, examining it before handing it back to her. I shook my head, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's the Bryant family's ancestral talisman, you should keep it safe. Once Elliott recovers, there will be plenty of women wanting to bear his children. This, you can save for your true grandson."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, I turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh of resignation, Laura said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You refuse my shares, you say there's no need for me to kneel, you won't even accept gifts for the child. Is your heart made of stone? What do I have to do for you to let me see my child?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched her, helpless and lost, and couldn't help but recall a past life. A life where I humbly knelt outside their door for three days and three nights, yet she still refused to see me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart hasn't fully turned to stone yet. Otherwise, I wouldn't give a damn about Elliott's condition, let alone waste my time here with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she was just too cruel to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she fawned over Giselle, ruthlessly kicking me out, was even more outrageous than in our past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the one who kicked me out back then, and now, she wants to see the kid? Sorry, but no matter what, that's not happening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, my heart is made of stone now. So, you can stop wasting your efforts. I'm not the person I used to be. Now, I have money and a career. And my child is the lifeblood of me and my parents. There's no way I'm letting you see them. Give it up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her no glimmer of hope, cutting her off with absolute certainty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my words, Laura seemed to take a massive blow. She collapsed heavily onto the ground, burying her face in her hands as she began to sob uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ignored her, turned on my heel, swung the door open, and strode out without a second glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and Jasper were outside. At the sound of Laura's crying, they both rushed over immediately. Elliott asked me in a panic:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why is my mom crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't bully her! As for why she's crying, go ask her yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said nonchalantly, then headed straight for the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had already bolted into the bedroom, and I thought Elliott would stay behind to comfort his mom. But to my surprise, I had barely reached the car when he was already hot on my heels.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you staying to comfort your mom?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, somewhat taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's fine, my dad's with her. What did you two talk about? I just walked in and saw her taking out the family heirloom amulet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, she's nudging us to have kids. What else would she talk to me about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lightly skirted around the issue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott couldn't help but chuckle upon hearing this. He looked at me tenderly, taking my icy hand into his. He then gently pressed a kiss onto the back of my hand, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really resist the idea of us having a child that much? Just imagine, a little one with both your looks and mine. Isn't that a beautiful thought?"</span></p></div>
