        <h1>Chapter 594 Slap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and I were bewildered and at a loss for words at the sudden turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We exchanged a glance and immediately followed suit, heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we reached the entrance of the operating room, I spotted a familiar tall figure standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood with his hands in his pockets, gazing quietly in the direction of the operating room, his expression inscrutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott, I instinctively halted, suddenly reluctant to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige, unaware of the situation, pulled me along, urging me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come on, now's not the time to stand around, what are you waiting for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige probably hadn't noticed Elliott standing not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shout caught Elliott's attention, and he quickly turned his gaze towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, he hesitated for a moment before striding towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, seeing me staring ahead, turned her head in confusion. When she saw Elliott approaching, Paige instinctively opened her arms to shield me, despite her heavily pregnant belly, and sternly warned Elliott, "Elliott, what are you doing? I warn you, you and Madeline have no relationship now, you better stay away from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't even spare Paige a glance. His gaze landed directly on me as he spoke, "Giselle went into premature labor, you must have heard, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone remained calm, devoid of any new fatherly joy. Instead, I noticed his furrowed brow, hinting at a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, how are both Giselle and the baby?" I asked nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The baby is too small, already in the neonatal intensive care unit, Giselle just had a severe hemorrhage and is still in emergency care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone remained composed, but his unfathomable gaze remained fixed on me. I stared back into his eyes, only seeing endless enigmas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In our moments of deep affection, we had once fantasized about becoming parents, imagining how happy and joyful we would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had also imagined that Elliott would be waiting outside the delivery room, just like he was for Giselle, eagerly anticipating the arrival of our child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, our child was quietly growing in my belly while our relationship had long since shattered, never to return to its former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the bright red light emanating from the operating room, a bitter feeling surging in my heart, a sudden jealousy overwhelming my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a bitter laugh, unable to resist a sarcastic remark. "So, how does it feel to be a father? Must be exhilarating, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew I was provoking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left my mouth, a flash of hidden pain appeared on Elliott's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed and calmly replied, "It's too early to feel excited, considering the uncertainty of the child's health and Giselle's condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his calm demeanor unsettled me, especially the tinge of worry in his voice when mentioning Giselle, making me uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, if it weren't for your push, maybe the child wouldn't have been born so soon. You should feel guilty now, shouldn't you?" I asked coldly once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stood in silence, unaware of what was happening, looking at me and Elliott with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Elliott replied in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those simple words felt like a heavy weight on my heart, dragging it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, wailing cries echoed through the entire hallway.</span></p></div>
