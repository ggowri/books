        <h1>Chapter 14 Shout Louder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">But unexpectedly, at the very moment I stuck out my tongue, that damn bastard suddenly bit down hard on it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The intense pain spread from the tip of my tongue to my whole body, and I recoiled in agony, letting out a scream that I couldn&#x27;t hold back. I covered my mouth, writhing in pain, and rolled to the edge of the bed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott seized the opportunity and swiftly pulled the quilt away from under me. He quickly wrapped himself up in it, and at the same time, in the darkness, I distinctly heard his laughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Madeline, keep shouting and shout louder. My parents will be happy to hear it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You are perverted and shameless. You are a bastard. You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Realizing that he had just been playing me and that his true intention was to take away the quilt, I couldn&#x27;t help but angrily curse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This is the consequence of you provoking me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this moment, Elliott spoke with a hint of pride in his words. He wrapped himself in the quilt, turned his back to me, and actually fell asleep just like that.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Regardless of the season, I would habitually set the air conditioner temperature to the lowest and then cover myself with a thick quilt before sleeping.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this moment, I was wearing extremely thin pajamas, and the air conditioning in this room was enough to make me shiver.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was said that men tended to take care of women, but Elliott slept soundly in the quilt, soon emitting a steady breathing sound.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I wasn&#x27;t the person he cared about after all. Even if I froze and caught a cold, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have any sympathy for me, not even a bit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I instinctively embraced my cold body and couldn&#x27;t help but recall the chilly and gloomy feeling when I struggled in the vast sea in my previous life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I was just now actually being toyed with by this heartless man to the point of almost losing my sanity.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I couldn&#x27;t help but blame myself, and I really felt useless.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In my future life, I must find a few young and handsome guys to experience love, get more familiar with men&#x27;s tricks, and try kissing a few times. Then I wouldn&#x27;t be so unsettled like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Standing under the cold air, I blamed myself and felt helpless. Watching his back inexplicably angered me. I no longer wanted to go back to sleep on this bed that belonged to us.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I lay on the sofa in the dark, hugging a pillow. I fell asleep in a daze while feeling cold all over my body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The next day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When I opened my eyes, I felt warm. I looked closely and realized that someone had covered me with a quilt, but the big bed was already empty.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Was it him?</p><p style="text-align:left;">No. He never showed the slightest bit of concern for me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I subconsciously glanced at my phone. Obviously, at this point in time, Elliott had already left home for the company.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I went downstairs. Sean brought over the breakfast that had been prepared for me a long time ago. He also handed me a few packets of medicine.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sean said, &quot;Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Jasper Bryant and Mrs. Laura Bryant have left in a hurry. Mrs. Laura Bryant specially brought the medicine to improve your health. I was instructed to remind you to take it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Another prescription to help me get pregnant?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I looked at the medicine and asked, not knowing whether to cry or laugh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes. Mrs. Laura Bryant said that this medicine was very difficult to obtain. She had to wait in line for a long time to buy it. Mrs. Bryant, please hold on a little longer. As long as you get pregnant, everything will be fine.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although Sean was sent by my in-laws to take care of us, he had always been kind to me since I got married. He also knew that I had tried various prescriptions to get pregnant in the past two years and had suffered a lot, so he comforted me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Okay, then I will bring the medicine to my parents&#x27; home later.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">My in-laws had already left, so I didn&#x27;t need to stay here and pretend to be affectionate with Elliott anymore. I planned to leave after finishing breakfast and packing a few clothes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mrs. Bryant, are you going back to your parents&#x27; home again?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sean asked in astonishment, with a hint of sadness in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had always been perceptive. Perhaps he noticed before Elliott that I had changed a lot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Well, I am going to work. It will be more convenient for me to stay at my parents&#x27; place, so please take care of things here.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I nodded and quickly went upstairs to grab a few clothes after having a simple breakfast.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When I drove out, Sean hurriedly fetched me the medicine that I intentionally forgot to take and placed it on the passenger seat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I said goodbye to him and drove away from Serenity Villa. As the car reached the corner, I turned my head and glanced at those several packets of medicine. After thinking for a moment, I picked them up and threw them all into the trash bin.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I would stop being a foolish, cheap, and unappreciated baby-making machine. I would never let myself be ruined by these inexplicable medicines and develop stomach cancer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I shook my head with a bitter smile and drove back to my parents&#x27; house, where I practiced the piano all day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shortly after this period in my previous life, the Bryant Group held a grand mid-year banquet. They were originally supposed to invite a famous pianist, but the pianist was involved in a major car accident on the way and was absent from the banquet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was an extremely important banquet for the Bryant Group. The absence of the pianist disrupted the entire event. Just when everyone was at a loss, the unremarkable Giselle unexpectedly volunteered and claimed to have learned piano. She said she was willing to go on stage as a substitute.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was Giselle&#x27;s amazing performance that caught Elliott&#x27;s attention.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That piano performance became the beginning of their intersection.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I thought of this and uncontrollably laughed bitterly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When I was young, I used to be the girl hailed as a piano prodigy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">My parents spared no expense to cultivate my piano skills, hiring a renowned teacher to instruct me. And I did live up to their expectations. At the age of 11, I won an award in an international piano competition with my performance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If I had continued on the original path, I would have become the most dazzling socialite in Hoswich City.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, under the instigation of Jade Mayers, my cousin, I later became rebellious and unwilling to follow my parents&#x27; arrangements. I started skipping school and became obsessed with everything exciting, such as e-sports, racing, and billiards, which my father forbade me to get involved in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The life that my father planned for me was all destroyed by me. If I had not fallen in love with Elliott later and studied hard to get into the university where he was, I might have completely neglected my studies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I looked back at everything I did back then. They were so absurd. Even I myself felt regretful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Fortunately, in this lifetime, it was not too late to correct my mistakes. Everything could be remedied in time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I had made up my mind to divorce Elliott at any time, but I would never let Giselle shine brightly in front of Elliott so easily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In my previous life, Giselle ended my life and took away everything from me. In this life, no matter what, I would never let her and Elliott be together again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After making up my mind, I decided to practice the piano diligently from now on so that on the day of the mid-year banquet, I would be the one to save the day.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And now, the day of the mid-year banquet of the Bryant Group was getting closer and closer...</p><p style="text-align:left;"></p></div>
