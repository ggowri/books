        <h1>Chapter 812: A World of Three</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, what brings you here? We were just about to have dinner. Come, please have a seat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of surprise, Marcus, as the host, immediately rose to greet him. He even promptly had one of his subordinates vacate a seat for Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smile on my face had frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't see it coming, Elliott showing up out of the blue. I mean, he never even hinted he'd be here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Elliott had made his way to the dining table. He glanced at the empty seat Marcus had left for him, but instead of sitting down, he walked straight over to my side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he deliberately draped his arm over my shoulder. His voice was deceptively gentle:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Barry mentioned you guys were cultivating a medicinal herb farm around here, so I thought I'd swing by. Didn't expect to find you in Norch City. Why didn't you give me a heads up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that we're developing a medicinal herb base has been kept under wraps, known only to us. How on earth would Barry get wind of it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott suddenly show up here because he was worried about me, or was it because he had a bone to pick with the deal between Marcus and me? I couldn't tell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, even though I agreed to Dr. Jones that I would cooperate with Elliott's treatment, I didn't want our relationship to become public knowledge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he's suddenly here, and I can't avoid him. So, I have no choice but to give him a polite nod, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here on business. What brings you to Norch City? You never mentioned it&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here on business too, was supposed to head back today. I didn't think it was necessary to mention it to you. But unexpectedly, you're here as well."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing my aloofness, Elliott withdrew his hand. Yet, he didn't take a seat in the vacant spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood by my side, refusing to leave. Adam got the hint immediately. He hastily rose to his feet and said to Elliott:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, take a seat here. That spot over there catches the breeze, it's cooler. I'll sit there instead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam instantly yielded his spot to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't stand on ceremony, he just plopped down. Then, out of the blue, he grabbed my hand, his voice brimming with concern:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your hands are so cold. Even though the temperature in Norch City is comfortable, you should still keep warm. Don't catch a cold."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott, in front of everyone, took off his jacket and draped it over my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did this, clearly for all to see.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, these subordinates, who were oblivious to the situation between Elliott and me, dropped their cutlery, each one looking somewhat bewildered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. We've all had our fill. The food is delicious, help yourself to more. Once you're done, we can chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I set down my knife and fork, wiped my mouth, and rose from the dining table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel it, the moment I rose to my feet, Elliott's eyes were filled with a profound sense of loss and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must be puzzled, wondering why I'm not elated to see him, but rather so indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, according to his memory, I should be overjoyed to see him. But I can't. I can't even pretend to be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit, once I've fallen out of love with someone, no matter where I see them, I no longer feel any joy. In fact, I might even feel a deep-seated revulsion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling is uncontrollable, it stems from the heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped out into the yard.</span></p></div>
