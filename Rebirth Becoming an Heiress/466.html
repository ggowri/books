        <h1>Chapter 466 He Wants to Meet Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chatting away, Paige suddenly shifted the conversation to me, asking with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my affirmative response, Paige sighed suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from Philip that Elliott's sick. He has a high fever of 104 fahrenheit degree. He was sent to the hospital in the middle of the night yesterday, but his fever hasn't subsided. The doctors were on edge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's words instantly made me nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately looked up, nervously asking, "What about now? Is he okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His temperature should have come down by now. But he's still receiving IV fluids in the hospital, and he's not very coherent. Philip went to see him. He just messaged me about it. Elliott has been calling your name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige looked at me and spoke truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt like it had been stabbed, a peculiar pain spreading through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, when he got close to me, I could feel the exhaustion emanating from his body. His dark circles were particularly prominent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he was just tired. I didn't expect him, who had always been healthy, to fall ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sank into the sofa, feeling absent-minded. I unconsciously reached for the coffee on the table and tried to take a sip, but my hands were shaking so much that I almost spilled the coffee all over myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Fiona, sitting next to me, noticed something was wrong. She immediately grabbed my hand, steadying the coffee cup, then placed it back on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With his good health, as long as the fever subsides, he'll be fine. Don't worry too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona patted my shoulder, comforting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I snapped out of it, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. But it's a bit scary for an adult to have a fever of 104 fahrenheit degree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the fever goes down, everything will be fine. You can't move on from him, can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head, feeling a bit flustered as I glanced at her. Her question left me momentarily unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, when I heard Paige mention his high fever and unconsciousness while calling my name, I did feel a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this worry wasn't directly related to whether I had let go of him or not. It was just a subconscious concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige handed me her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip just took this video. Take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Paige finished speaking, I saw Elliott lying weakly on the hospital bed, hooked up to an IV, looking very frail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemed to be the first time he had fallen seriously ill since I had known him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what I could recall, he hardly ever fell ill, always brimming with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he laid there, a trace of stubble gracing his chin, his complexion waning, his lips lacking color, he appeared to be in discomfort, a furrow creasing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip intentionally moved the camera closer to his face. I saw his lips move, and then I heard his weak voice in the video,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't leave me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This voice came through the phone's speaker clearly into my ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shuddered all over, my hand holding Paige's phone trembling, almost dropping it on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this, Fiona, concerned that the video of Elliott might trigger an emotional response in me, promptly retrieved the phone, secured the screen, and passed it to Paige. Her tone carried a hint of annoyance as she spoke, "Paige, come on. She's already determined to divorce Elliott. Why did you show her this video?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said aggrievedly, "I just thought, she's pregnant now. If she divorces Elliott at this critical time, won't her future be very difficult? Is she really going to be a single mother?"</span></p></div>
