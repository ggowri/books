        <h1>Chapter 354 Meeting Old Friends</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's voice had been filled with excitement, and her smile was radiant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment she saw Elliott and me walking in together, her smile froze. Her sweet voice was caught in her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at the lilies adorning Elliott's desk and the flowers in Giselle's hands. I immediately understood the source of her dismay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spun around to face Elliott. My anger bubbled over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige is responsible for the flower arrangements. Why is she providing these flowers?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Giselle had free access to Elliott's office indicated that this had become a regular occurrence, not just a one-time incident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige is responsible for the flower arrangements. I just wanted to make Elliott's office special, so I brought him different flowers each day to brighten his mood at work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Elliott could respond, Giselle spoke up defensively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you? Giselle, do you think you are a member of the Bryant family? How dare you, an ordinary employee, have the right to be in the president's office?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only fueled my fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I didn't mean anything by it. I'm just grateful for you helping my family buy a house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Elliott, Giselle tried to defend herself. Her eyes were welling up with fake tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at her. My anger reached its peak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get those tacky lilies out of here. Don't you dare come into this office without permission! Barry! Where is that assistant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing at the door, I ordered Giselle to get out. At the same time, I loudly called Barry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, upon hearing his name, quickly entered the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mrs. Bryant. What are your orders?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the personal assistant, how can you allow just anyone to enter the president's office at will?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crossed my arms and harshly scolded Barry in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry glanced at Giselle and then at Elliott, who said nothing. Soon, Barry understood the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry apologized and bowed. "Mrs. Bryant, I'm sorry. I will be more vigilant in the future. Giselle, please do as Mrs. Bryant says."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's voice trembled. Her eyes were pleading with him. There was clearly a strong unwillingness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need flowers in my office. Get them out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instead agreed with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle instantly looked sullen. Tears had already wetted her eyes. But she quietly removed the flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I clearly felt a resentful glare that she shot me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned to leave, I noticed a slight bulge in her lower abdomen, despite her thick clothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank as I recalled the scene in the hospital when Laura had accompanied Giselle for her pregnancy test.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't shake the thought that Giselle might indeed be pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had already left Elliott's office. Seeing me standing there, Elliott misinterpreted my silence as lingering anger and pulled me to sit beside him on the sofa, enveloping me in his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, my love. It's a minor issue. No need to be angry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently caressed my nose. His tone was playful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at him and retorted, "A small matter? This has been going on for a while, hasn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a busy man, so how would I notice such things? Besides, Giselle meant well. She just wants to liven up the office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, then consider me meddlesome. From now on, no matter what woman shows up in your office, I won't ask any questions. Goodbye, Mr. Bryant!"</span></p></div>
