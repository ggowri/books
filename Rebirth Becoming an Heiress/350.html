        <h1>Chapter 350 You Can Hate Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this night, for the first time, we lay together in the same bed in my former room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held me as tightly as he clutched a treasure that he had finally regained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My bed was soft and surrounded by beautiful white curtains. Lily had kept these things that I adored as a girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even my comforter still exuded a sweetly fruity fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no strength at all, but my mind remained active.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked Elliott, "Have you read every page of my diary?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I have."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hoarse and magnetic voice came pleasantly into my ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to take some words in it seriously. I was too young at the time to understand what those words mean."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely remembered the many passionate love declarations within those pages, including promises of eternal love and vows to follow him to the ends of the earth, even if it meant I would become </span><span>the</span><span> lowly </span><span>one</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were all the wishful thoughts of a girl blinded by infatuation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who penned those words was a distant memory. It was impossible for me to consider Elliott as my one and only, as I had before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't even sure how I felt about him now. If I had no feelings for him at all, I wouldn't have been able to be so obsessed with him again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I said I loved him, I always felt that I was no longer the same person I used to be. Therefore, whether I loved him or not was a bit vague to me now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I felt your sincere love, which made me touched. I didn't know before that you had done so many things for me silently</span><span>. At that time, I mistook your love for childish infatuation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled in my ear. He reached out to squeeze my waist lovingly and kissed my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you so disgusted with me before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the past, I turned around. In the darkness, I blinked and looked at his delicate jaw.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and then calmly gave me an answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because no man is willing to exchange his </span><span>marriage </span><span>for assistance to his family. I wasn't disgusted with you. I just couldn't accept this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time I had heard Elliott explain this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally figured out that he never thought I was bad. Instead, this marriage had wounded his pride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you didn't hate me at that time, did you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chuckle rumbled in his chest, followed by a gentle kiss on my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was true at first, but then you became too annoying. You always got angry with me, crossed the line, and always appeared in places where I didn't like your presence. At that time, you were not as sensible as you are now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably afraid that the truth would hurt me, so he kissed me for a while as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I was indeed such a person during the first two years of my marriage to him. The way I expressed my love was too arbitrary. I was willful then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I was eager to get his attention, I made him hate me further. He would rather hook up with other women outside than stay home with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I admitted that I did not do well, I still felt angry when I thought of the harm he had done to me at that time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed his hand away, pretending to be angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I am and will be willful. Even if we are in a sweet love now, it doesn't mean anything. I must still be myself. If you can't accept it, you can continue to hate me. It's okay."</span></p></div>
