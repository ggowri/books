        <h1>Chapter 234 Embarrassment</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, I went upstairs, changed into an elegant dress, and put on light makeup. Then, I went out with Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily specially prepared gifts, and the two of us went to the hospital where Cormac stayed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was around 9:30 a.m. when we arrived at the hospital. Elliott shouldn't be in the hospital at this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I got to the ward, I didn't see Elliott in the hospital as I expected. However, I saw the disgusting Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even brought Nicole. Of course, Jasper and Laura were also there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we entered, Cormac was awake. Laura saw me first, then she saw Lily and walked forward with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Mr. Cormac Bryant accidentally fell, so I came over to visit him. I brought something for him. I hope Mr. Cormac Bryant can get well soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and Laura immediately greeted each other. Then, she handed over the expensive supplements to Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had always been very polite and bought a lot of high-end supplements. Laura took them with a smile and put them aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you could come, and you don't have to bring these. We are family. Madeline, tell your mom not to buy anything next time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smirked politely, and I smirked, too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed a white linen bag and several small plastic bags in the corner of the ward. It looked like they were specialties or medicines sent by Nicole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Lily went to the hospital bedside and talked to Cormac for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed behind and saw Nicole staring at Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole dressed up carefully today. She wore a silk white dress and a gold necklace. However, the fabric was probably not very good. In short, it didn't look as exquisite as Lily's dress. The cut and texture of the dress were a lot worse than that of Lily's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how old women were, they would secretly make comparisons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt Giselle lower her head in shame after watching Lily closely for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I didn't expect Madeline's to be so young and elegant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't know Nicole and was a little surprised at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, let me introduce you. This is Nicole, the mother of my goddaughter Giselle, and Lily, the mother of Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura immediately stepped forward and introduced with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Lily nodded and was a little suspicious. She had obviously never heard Laura had a goddaughter, but she still reached out politely and said, "Nice to meet you. You are also very young. We should be about the same age, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole shyly reached out. I noticed her hands were rough and calloused, probably due to pruning flowers all year round.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice to meet you. I'm 48 years old. You look elegant. You should be about the same age as me," Nicole smiled, wrinkles appearing on the corner of her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily said, "I gave birth to a child late, and I'm 58 years older, three years older than Laura."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily told her age. A 10-year age difference made Nicole a little awkward, and she smiled in embarrassment, "I really didn't see it. You're well-preserved."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Elliott say you're a good cook and love to grow flowers. If I have a chance, I will try your cooking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura joined their conversation immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women soon chatted before Cormac's bed.</span></p></div>
