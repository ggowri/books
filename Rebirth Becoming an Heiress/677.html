        <h1>Chapter 677 Never Compromise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who exactly is challenging whose bottom line?" Elliott suddenly got angry, "It's you who is interested in my woman! You are the one who crossed the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Giselle did pass away, but that doesn't mean everything between you and her can be erased! Have you forgotten what you did?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also angry. He desperately tried to pull Elliott's hand away, and then forcefully pulled me behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked into Elliott's eyes. A strong intuition told me that his gaze had completely changed from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle has already passed away. It has also been confirmed that the child is not mine. Madeline and I have a real chance of reconciling. Quinn, you can disappear now, you third wheel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at Quinn. The fierce and determined look on his face indicated that he had no intention of backing down at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that since Elliott had already believed that the child had nothing to do with him, he would gradually distance himself from my world. But unexpectedly, he chose to continue entangling himself and showed no intention of letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Sylvia noticed that the atmosphere between them had become tense, so she quickly defused the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I can understand your feelings toward Ms. Mayers. However, it was you who first did something to hurt her, and besides, she is now with Mr. Woods and they have a child together. Sometimes letting go is also a form of fulfillment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia's words did not make Elliott change his mind. On the contrary, he looked at me with a tenderness that I couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have made up my mind. I accept the child in your belly, no matter whose it is. In the future, neither my grandfather nor Giselle will be an obstacle between us. Madeline, I cannot be without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's heartfelt confession came so suddenly, it took me by surprise. However, I didn't feel moved. On the contrary, I could only feel an indescribable aversion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does he mean by this statement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter whose child is in my belly, he acknowledged it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who did he think he was? Did he think I was still the woman who would wait for him no matter how he treated me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes men can be so arrogant, it's truly laughable and unreasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, enough. I don't want to hear you say these things. And, I have already made my thoughts clear to you before. I'm sorry, but I am not a woman who will always obey your commands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed his hand away forcefully, stood up, and walked over to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, who had rarely had any physical contact with me before, unexpectedly grabbed my hand at that moment, for reasons unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he looked at Elliott and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Madeline has made it very clear. We are all adults. Once something has started, there's no turning back. You don't need to be stubborn about it. Otherwise, it will be very ugly if we all end up tearing each other apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn originally wanted to persuade Elliott to let go, however, Elliott remained completely indifferent. Not only did he not listen to advice, but he also coldly emphasized once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll say it again, Madeline was my woman. No matter what, I would never let go, let alone give her to you!"</span></p></div>
