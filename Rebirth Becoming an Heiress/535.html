        <h1>Chapter 535 Uneasy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw his parents' residence, a vague uneasiness grew in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back and get some rest. Wait for me to contact you," Quinn said after getting out of the car. With his suitcase, he walked into the villa with an unruly stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam turned the car around and drove me home. On the way, this always perceptive young man seemed to have sensed something and tentatively asked me, "Madeline, I do think that you and Quinn are actually quite matched."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their time together, Adam and Quinn bridged the gap between them, bonding over their shared personalities and forming a close friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to pair us off. Adam, focus on your work," I said helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I genuinely believe that. Madeline, I sense that Quinn has a crush on you, although he might not be aware of it himself," Adam added. His words stirred a slight confusion within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible. We're nothing more than good friends. Don't speculate about our relationship and remember what your job is." I quickly silenced Adam to prevent him from saying more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I felt that there wasn't love between Quinn and me, but when it came to understanding the true nature of our relationship, even I was uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam dutifully kept his mouth shut and soon dropped me off at my door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't informed my parents about my presence in Carthage after such a lengthy absence. Instead, I had fabricated a story about being away on business to spare them any worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night when we arrived at the door. I didn't tell them, so upon entering the house, I planned to tiptoe into my room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Austin suddenly came out from his study. At the sight of me, he immediately turned on the lights and hurriedly called out Lily's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scratching my head in embarrassment, I couldn't help but ask, "Dad, why are you still up so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin immediately rushed over to me and exclaimed enthusiastically, "Madeline, why didn't you let us know in advance when you got back? Marcus filled me in on everything you've been up to in Carthage lately, and I've also read the corresponding reports. The development of this medication couldn't have come at a better time. Marcus mentioned that numerous hospitals have been placing orders one after another upon seeing the reports. You've truly made a significant contribution to combating this viral infection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had assumed they were unaware, but to my astonishment, Marcus had actually briefed Austin and Lily on everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you knew it," I instantly smiled in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is more than that. Austin's been keeping a close eye on Carthage these past few days. How could we not be worried when you were over there? It's a relief that you've returned safely. A few days ago, we heard about the lockdown there, which made Austin and me very anxious. Madeline, are you hungry? What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you." Whenever I came home, Lily's first concern was whether I was hungry and what I wanted to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't starving, but because I hadn't eaten Lily's cooking for too long, her questions made me develop a slight appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From my expression, Lily realized I was hungry and asked me to wait with a smile. Soon, she went to the kitchen to make a plate of spaghetti and brought it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shared spaghetti with Austin, briefly discussing the events in Carthage. Afterwards, I retreated to my room, enjoyed a soothing shower, and drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Quinn's call woke me up when I was still under the covers.</span></p></div>
