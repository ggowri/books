        <h1>Chapter 654 An Accident Occurred</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, Mrs. Bryant asked me to inform you to hurry to the hospital, Sir. Bryant...can't hold on much longer!" Goree rushed into the room and urgently shouted to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott froze, as if suddenly sobering up from a strong alcoholic haze. His brows furrowed. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir. Bryant was very angry and removed the oxygen mask and all the tubes from his body. There's nothing the doctors can do to save him now. Sir. Bryant probably waited to see you one last time," Goree said hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably an urgent situation. Goree rushed in, sweating profusely on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Elliott didn't hesitate. He immediately followed Goree out of the room and quickly went to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the banquet scene, Cormac had already been taken away by an ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a junior, hearing such news, I also felt a bit complicated inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as I thought about how they betrayed me in the past, secretly having Giselle undergo in vitro fertilization and using various methods to drive me away from the Bryant family, that slight feeling of guilt in my heart instantly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not my fault. What truly made Cormac angry was not my actions, but those crazy deeds that Giselle made in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to console myself, but Quinn seemed to see through me. He patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to blame yourself. It wasn't you who made Mr. Bryant sick like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, at least he found out the truth, which is better than being deceived until death. By doing this, you are not harming the Bryant family, but helping them. Otherwise, they would have to raise that child for the rest of their lives." Fiona immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Giselle was really cunning. She dared to take advantage of the Bryant family's trust in her and conspired with the doctor to pass off another man's child as the Bryant family's own. Wasn't she afraid of the embarrassment that would come after everything was exposed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shook her head. She couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm right about this, Giselle would have used that child first to achieve her goal of entering the Bryant family, and then joined forces with the doctor to make the child die young. This way, her secret would remain unknown. As long as that child is dead, no one will suspect her anymore. After all, that child has Down syndrome and was </span><span>born prematurely with various illnesses, no one will suspect its early death." I analyzed it rationally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, I didn't quite understand. Giselle, knowing that she was pregnant, would secretly drink alcohol and seemingly never pay attention to the health of her child. Giselle knew the screening result, yet she still took the risk and insisted on concealing it from the doctor, determined to give birth to this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize it until I found that the child was not a Bryant. Giselle was merely using the child as a stepping stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as long as she successfully married Elliott, she was not afraid that they would not have a real Bryant's baby in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle used a child with a congenital disadvantage to achieve her goals, and I truly despise such methods. Nevertheless, that child is ultimately her own. Didn't she feel any sadness at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my analysis, Paige said, "No wonder Giselle was so secretive before, not going to the Bryant family's private hospital but insisting on going to the hospital where Fiona is for her check-up. She really had a well-thought-out plan! If you hadn't discovered this matter in advance and made it public, the Bryant family would have really been manipulated by her! But Elliott is such a sharp person. How could he be completely outsmarted by Giselle this time?"</span></p></div>
