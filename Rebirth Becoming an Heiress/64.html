        <h1>Chapter 64 Don't Be Afraid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept my head down. My emotions remained inexplicably low. If he had said that before, I could have confidently told him, "No, you're wrong. I don't care about him at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I find myself unable to refute it. Because I know better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Giselle and Elliott met, my emotions were truly in complete disarray...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he still in the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent for a long time. Eventually, I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't know. How about I accompany you to the hospital again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn asked me tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do I have to go again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also asked myself in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What difference does it make whether I go or not? Even if I went and saw them together, what difference would it make?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole heart was caught in a dilemma. And Quinn, clearly seeing through my thoughts, pulled me aside and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. I'll accompany you for another visit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally wanted to refuse. But I don't know why, in the end, I still got into his car with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We once again arrived at the entrance of that hospital ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the small window at the door of the ward, I saw Giselle wearing a patient gown. She was still half lying in bed. And the tall figure by her bedside was clearly Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he always busy with work?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In theory, at this point in time, he should have already been working at Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he has given up all his work for her. He willingly stays by Giselle's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be chatting again. Perhaps, they were talking about something funny. Because I saw Giselle on the hospital bed unable to hold back her laughter, covering her mouth. And Elliott, he had his back turned to me. I couldn't see his expression. But his entire posture was clearly relaxed and natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them really hit it off at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mingming, they had just met yesterday. Are they already getting along so well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this kind of relaxed and natural sweetness is something that I had tried so hard to achieve in my marriage, but couldn't force it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clearly didn't care anymore. But why is my heart still hurting like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered my chest. For a moment, I didn't even have the courage to push open the door of the ward. So, I turned around and wanted to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn stopped me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to you? Are you afraid to go in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I had the need to go in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Quinn. I smiled weakly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not like the carefree you during this period of time. Didn't you keep saying that you don't care about him anymore? Now, a young girl who has just entered society has defeated you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn raised an eyebrow and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible? Of course, I didn't care about him anymore. I was too lazy to bother about who he liked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I felt Quinn's provocation, I instantly retorted. I quickly snapped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Be brave. I thought you had turned back into the timid coward you used to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn laughed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he leaned close to my ear and suddenly whispered something to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't be afraid. Return the pain given to you by others a thousandfold, a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sudden words hit me like a powerful stimulant, injecting fiercely into my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly woke up from that state of inertia and despondency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, what am I doing? Why until now, am I still plagued by doubts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had long stopped caring about Elliott. Even now, if there is a Giselle by his side, so what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was I sad? Why was I sad because of those two people in my previous life who caused me so much pain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouldn't have let my emotions be affected by these two jerks at all. On the contrary, I should have done everything in my power to return all the pain I have endured in the past to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mood was turned upside down as if by force. In an instant, the gloom that Giselle brought to me disappeared completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn. On his handsome face, there was a full encouragement. He gestured for me to go in and face everything.</span></p></div>
