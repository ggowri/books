        <h1>Chapter 425 Jealous</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the screen displaying "Elliott" on my phone, I was stunned for a few seconds before stepping aside to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you get Austin out of the hospital already?" Elliott's voice came in, sounding somewhat subdued and with a hint of interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," I replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me beforehand? The doctors said Austin's condition is still unstable. He should have stayed in the hospital for a bit longer." Elliott's tone grew even more somber, tinged with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. He's been in the hospital for a while. A change of environment might be more helpful for him," I said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you guys now? I'm outside your house, but it looks like no one's home," Elliott said, his words tinged with a hint of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I forgot to tell you. That place had a few incidents, and it wasn't safe, so I moved," I quickly explained. I didn't expect Elliott to come to my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't even tell me you were moving?" Elliott's tone became even more displeased. "I just saw the photos you posted. You guys are having lunch at home, right? Is Quinn at your place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word he spoke carried a hint of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted truthfully, "Yes. We're having drinks. If you don't have anything important, I'll hang up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sudden silence from Elliott's end of the line. After a few seconds, I heard his deep voice again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? I'm hungry, too. I haven't had breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication in his words was so obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the dining room involuntarily. Marcus and Quinn engaged in lively conversation with my parents, creating a warm atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since my family had such a relaxed moment. I hoped it wouldn't be ruined by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, then go grab something to eat. I have guests at home. I'll hang up." I pretended not to understand his implications and promptly ended the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pocketing my phone, I returned to the table. At that moment, Marcus was asked about my father's health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother explained the situation truthfully. We were just having a casual conversation when Marcus suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, in your condition, medication might not necessarily be effective. Taking special treatment could be helpful. My family has a long history in medicine, and I learned that treatment from my grandfather. If you don't mind, I could give you the treatment once a week, along with some strengthening medicine. It should help you gradually recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words surprised both me and my mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't realized that not only did Marcus run such a large pharmaceutical company, but his family also had a long-standing tradition in medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It vaguely reminded me of high school when he always had some miraculous little pills in his backpack. Sometimes, when I or other classmates had minor stomachaches or headaches, we'd take his pills, and they really did work fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Marcus, are you sure you can help my dad regain his previous energy and vitality?" I asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't guarantee a hundred percent, but in Austin's case, I'm ninety percent confident," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p></div>
