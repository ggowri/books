        <h1>Chapter 80 Accompany Me to Appreciate the Moon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to accompany me to the rooftop to admire the moon tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "In the past two years, I invited him every year, but back then, he would just sneer at it and never wanted to accompany me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moon is really rising from the east now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself and said, "Okay, good idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after Toby dropped us off at Serenity Villa, we went straight to the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serenity Villa was a modernly designed small villa that the Bryant family specifically prepared for our wedding. The villa was conveniently located on the halfway up Bunera Hill. According to Sean, there was a river in front of it and Bunera Hill behind it, making it a place with breathtaking scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we first got married, I was full of anticipation for a happy life with Elliott. From the first day we moved in here, I created a small garden on the rooftop, planting flowers and a lawn. I also set up a swing, along with a unique small round table and two reclining chairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that when I was not busy, Elliott could also lie with me and enjoy the beautiful scenery around Serenity Villa, overlooking the entire cityscape of Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I was filled with joy as I arranged everything, but Elliott never once thought about stepping onto the rooftop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, everything I did was like a joke, and he didn't like it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made me very frustrated, and later I never went to the top floor again. I knew what the top floor had become now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I pushed open the glass door on the top floor. I had thought that it would be overgrown with weeds up there, but to my surprise, it was well-maintained and organized. Moreover, the flowers I had planted before were all in bloom. The entire rooftop looked like a miniature sky garden, incredibly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days ago, I came up here on a whim and found that it was beautifully decorated. Sean told me that you usually take care of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood behind me, his words revealing a hint of approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't been here for almost a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Sean, who is attentive, often comes up to take care of these plants, which is why this place can maintain such a state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we are going to appreciate the moon, let's prepare some red velvet cake and a dried fruit platter, and make a fruit platter as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and said to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I immediately went downstairs and rummaged through the cupboard to find the pine nuts, cashews, and raisins that I had bought before. I put them on a beautiful plate and took out the cantaloupe, cherry tomatoes, and grapes from the refrigerator. I washed them separately and put them on the fruit plate. Then, I assembled the cake that I had brought from my parents' house and the red velvet cake that Laura had sent over. Sean and I carried it together to the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We placed these things on the small round table, and at that time, Elliott was already sitting on the lounge chair, leisurely playing with his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean and I placed the small round table in between two recliners. After completing all of this, I quietly gave Sean a thumbs up, and he responded with a warm smile before heading downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay down on another lounge chair, lifted my head</span><span>,</span><span> and looked at the silent sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moonlight was exceptionally beautiful, with the moon resembling a huge silver plate, hanging high in the sky. A cloud covered half of the moon like a thin veil, making the whole Hoswich appear as if it was wearing a silver coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle breeze accompanied by the fragrance of flowers blew slowly, and this tranquil scene made me feel as if time had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Elliott nor I spoke. We lay on the rocking chair like that, as if neither of us wanted to break the rare tranquility.</span></p></div>
