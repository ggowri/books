        <h1>Chapter 761: I Won't Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott has penned an abundance of emotionally stirring words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Barry spilling the beans, I would never have linked these words to Elliott, a man who's always been so reserved and rarely shows his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's anonymous, probably too lonely in the dead of night, unable to sleep, so he vents his emotions through the internet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His passionate words drew a large crowd of female netizens, with many curious about his identity. However, he never responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also folks in the comments teaching him ways to win the girl back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, many of his previous actions were not only taught by his driver, but also inspired by some netizens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I meticulously perused every word he posted. Just as I was about to close the webpage, my eyes caught a glimpse of a message he had previously sent out:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Have you ever risked your life for someone else? I did today. I might die here, but as long as she and the child survive, I have no regrets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This message was riddled with gibberish, akin to a grade-schooler's scrawl, littered with odd symbols. Hence, I initially dismissed it as website gobbledygook.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his last update, with an IP address trailing from Norch City. Clearly, it was posted after the incident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gibberish could very well be due to him being injured at the time, typing out the text with his last ounce of strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my mind's eye, I couldn't help but picture him, battered and bruised, yet still clutching his phone to type out these words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears blurred my vision in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confess, these words, they touched a soft spot deep within me, melting the hardness that had been there for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, I was plagued by insomnia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pondered for a long while, a myriad of thoughts swirling in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have this urge to go see how he's doing right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a detail mentioned by Quinn gave me pause.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If memory serves me right, Quinn mentioned that there was a woman who stuck by Elliott's side throughout his ordeal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guess I'll just wait a bit longer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My current state of health is pretty rough, even getting out of bed is a challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the doc had said, the wound on my belly needed bed rest, no wandering around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alright, I'll wait until my emotions are steady and my body's recovered before I go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made up my mind, and so, I spent another week recuperating in the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, Noah was finally cradled out of the incubator, and I, at last, could go home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day Noah and I were brought home, my parents were happier than ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They decked out the entire house with balloons and ribbons, even going as far as to roll out a long, red carpet. They prepared a cake and an abundance of delicious treats and dishes. The house was decorated more grandly than even Christmas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah returned home without a hint of fear. He nestled in his stroller, his eyes wide open, curiously observing everything around him. His eyes sparkled, making him look exceptionally adorable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At long last, my folks got their wish of cradling their grandson. They held Noah and didn't want to let go, their eyes glued to him. The more they looked, the more they found him adorable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their joy, my heart was equally filled with delight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ordered me to stay in bed and rest, but that afternoon, under the guise of postnatal recovery, I sneaked off to Barry Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dialed up Barry, intending to let him know I was en route to Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Barry's call was answered, it was by a woman, her voice captivatingly alluring:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, Barry just stepped out. Can I ask what you need him for?"</span></p></div>
