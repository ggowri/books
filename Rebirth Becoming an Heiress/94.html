        <h1>Chapter 94 Dinner</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I call you Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle smiled, like an innocent little white rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Once she found out that I married Elliott, she started getting closer to me. What a cunning woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put on a fake smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I didn't mind what you called me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle explained, "You and Elliott were very much in love. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in Elliott's office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had actually forgotten about this little incident, but Giselle reminded me of that awkward scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "It's okay. Elliott and I have been married for a long time. It's inevitable for couples to have some intimate moments. It's the same when you're in a relationship, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard before that your relationship was not good. It seems that those media were spreading rumors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle kept asking questions about my relationship with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what Giselle wanted to do unless she wanted to find out the truth from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The media likes to spread rumors. Elliott and I don't need to pay attention to these rumors, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be friendly and repeatedly emphasized that Elliott and I were in love in order to make Giselle give up coveting Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Elliott was really great. Madeline, you were lucky to be able to marry him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle did not hide her envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I actually really wanted to tell Giselle that she didn't have to envy me because she could quickly replace me and take away everything from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I politely smiled but remained silent because I didn't want to discuss this boring topic anymore. In doing so, Giselle had enough room for imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevator finally reached the first floor. I had never realized that the time spent riding the elevator could be so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and immediately walked out. Giselle, who was right behind me, noticed that her phone was ringing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard Giselle answering a phone call behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rowan, what did you say? You stayed in Hoswich and joined March as a legal assistant? Oh my goodness! Is it true? You previously said no law firm would hire you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Rowan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn successfully convinced Rowan to stay in Hoswich. Rowan even managed to become an assistant at Alexis' law firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan should have said something because I immediately heard Giselle yell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did your dad agree to you buying a house in Hoswich? Great! Shall we go and see the house now? Come to my flower shop and pick me up, and we can go together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle didn't even say goodbye to me as she bounced past me with her phone in hand. She swiftly left the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Rowan not only found a job, but his dad also promised to buy him a house in Hoswich." This is the best news for Giselle, who has always wanted to settle down in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was too naive. Clearly, Rowan's message reignited her hope and made her abandon her determination to break up with Rowan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Great! We are one step closer to breaking up Giselle and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Giselle run far away, I inexplicably felt extremely happy and sang all the way to my car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to drive when Elliott suddenly called me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I answered the phone, Elliott suddenly asked, "Did you leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was still downstairs. What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never had dinner with you outside. Let's have dinner together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly issued an invitation.</span></p></div>
