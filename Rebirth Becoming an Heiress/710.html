        <h1>Chapter 710 Quinn Was Reborn Because of Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, at that moment when I fell into the sea, it was you who saved me without hesitation?" I murmured, tears involuntarily streaming from my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't realize it at first, but he continued with my words, "Yes, I saw you sinking into the sea at that time, and they had already sailed far away. I couldn't accept this, so I jumped directly. However, the wind and waves were too strong that day, and it seemed like they had tied stones or something to you. I tried desperately to pull you up, but I couldn't. Later, a wave came and we both fell... Wait, that's not right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, at this point, suddenly widened his eyes, as if something had been vaguely confirmed. He joyfully and excitedly grabbed my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just asked me that, could it be... perhaps... Madeline, have you also been reborn like me?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn evidently doubted whether I, too, had been reborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, like me, he doubted it, but ultimately we both felt that this matter was too bizarre, to the point that we only had doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears kept streaming down my face. I had thought that in this lifetime, my rebirth was destined for me to walk alone in solitude. However, I never expected that fate would arrange a companion for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't understand before why Quinn was so good to me, but if he lived this life because of me, then I can understand everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, just like you, I thought I was dead at that time. But to my surprise, when I woke up, I found myself back several years ago." I nodded and admitted that I had also been reborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it!" Quinn exclaimed with even more joy, as he grabbed my hand. "No wonder I felt that you were completely different from before ever since I met you in this lifetime. The reason I used to dislike you was because of your humble and selfless appearance, always revolving around Elliott without any charm of your own. But in this lifetime, you have clearly changed a lot and become more aware. I had thought before that maybe you were like me, but I didn't think it was very likely. Now it seems that the gods must have been displeased with how you were treated in your past life, so they gave you a chance to start over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, so in this life, I cherish it especially. I cherish the time spent with my parents, cherish my limited youth, and cherish my dignity and self. I don't want to be easily trampled on by others anymore. Quinn, in the previous life, I was so badly harmed by Giselle, but in this life, I finally paid it all back! Thank you for being by my side so steadfastly from beginning to end, but don't think that you were reborn for me. You have your own life, don't you?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's love was just so deep, so deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked, moved, surprised, but more than anything, I felt guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, in the previous life, he was just a spectator. The harm he caused me was far less than Elliott and Giselle's, but he considered it his own fault and desperately tried to repay me in this life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was his kindness that got the best of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why wouldn't it be? If it weren't for you, I would have perished in those waters. Aren't you curious why I happened to be in the vicinity at that time?" Quinn asked me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because that day I went out to sea, actually... I wanted to commit suicide. I deliberately rented a fishing boat, intending to end my life in the ocean. But shortly after I set sail, I saw Giselle's yacht on the sea. I was curious at that moment, so I followed them from a distance. I saw the scene of them throwing you into the sea through a telescope. Actually, if it wasn't for saving you that day, I had planned to end my own life too."</span></p></div>
