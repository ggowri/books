        <h1>Chapter 851: The Party Under Siege</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movie "Rattlesnake" that I invested in, starring Dalton Lewis, has wrapped up filming. Dalton has invited me to join the wrap party.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after the last mishap, I've developed a significant mental block about Mexico, so I politely declined his invitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Dalton made a special trip to Hoswich city just to express his gratitude. Moreover, he even threw a party and invited me to attend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movie wrapped up smoothly, passed its rating, and everyone is thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton specifically chose a private vineyard for this party, inviting not just me, but also a slew of celebrities from Hoswich city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was held up by some matters, so I arrived quite late.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, I donned a long black lace dress, pulling my hair up into an elegant vintage bun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt my attire was quite dignified, befitting my status as the CEO of Glory Group. However, upon arriving at the venue, I realized my outfit was not quite appropriate. The lighting was incredibly bright, and under such illumination, my mesh skirt took on a rather revealing, see-through effect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to go back and change my clothes. I glanced down, feeling a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared to those scantily clad models and minor celebrities on the scene, my attire could be considered conservative.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in the midst of self-consolation when suddenly, a chubby hand hooked around my neck out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, a strong wave of alcohol fumes hit me, followed by a voice that was nothing short of crude:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I recognize you, you're the 'star' of this movie, no, the leading lady. Come, join me for a drink."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, I saw a chubby hand, adorned with a gold Rolex, extending a glass of red wine towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His other hand still rested on my shoulder, heavy and insistent. And that pig's hand of his was getting rather adventurous, daring to inch towards the collar of my shirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A jolt of surprise shot through me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few years, I've been navigating the business world. I've been underestimated before, especially when my identity was unknown. But this is the first time I've been publicly humiliated, treated like the "star attraction" of a brothel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heat of the moment, I didn't think twice. I grabbed the glass of red wine handed to me and splashed it right in his face!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I shoved his chubby hand away with all my might, instinctively stepping back a few paces. I said coldly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had too much to drink, have you? Let me help you sober up--"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man clearly didn't anticipate my move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my splash, his face was instantly smeared with red wine stains. Not only that, the wine soaked his floral shirt, making him look utterly disheveled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, I got a clear look at this person's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a towering figure, his skin a deep shade of tan. Around his neck hung a chunky gold chain, a stark contrast to his grey suit and floral shirt. He had the unmistakable air of a nouveau riche. His accent was thick, a clear indication that he was a foreigner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know him, yet there's a vague sense of familiarity, as if I've seen him somewhere before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in a state of confusion when, out of the blue, this guy let loose a string of obscenities. The kind that would make a sailor blush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the room erupted into chaos. A few men clad in camouflage gear burst in from outside the venue, encircling me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's the situation here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze in shock, and in that instant, the man swiftly wiped the red wine stain off his face, rushed over, and grabbed a handful of my hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare to splash wine on me? I reckon you're bloody asking for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man roared, yanking my hair and slamming me against a nearby pillar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head slammed into the pillar with a jolt, a wave of intense pain washing over me instantly, forcing a sharp scream to escape my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden intrusion of the "camouflage-clad" man and his violent demeanor plunged the scene into utter chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled desperately, yet he held onto my hair so tightly, refusing to let go. The pain was so intense that I could barely speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to grab my hair and slam me into the pillar again, a familiar deep voice echoed through.</span></p></div>
