        <h1>Chapter 129 My Male Best Friend Comforts Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott... should have already gone home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, how could a man who never cared about me possibly worry about me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I weakly smiled and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ask so many questions, can you take me to the hospital to have a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! If you don't seek treatment for your foot, you will be disabled! Philip, see if there is a clinic or hospital ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn appeared very nervous and shouted at the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he shouted like that, I realized that the person driving us was Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were you two doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We went off-road on the mountain,and just made it back in time.. You were lucky to run into us, otherwise what would you have done? Don't wander alone on the road so late in the future, you can't always be this fortunate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they were driving off-road vehicles. It turns out they were going for mountain off-roading. Their ways of entertainment are really diverse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Quinn subconsciously and noticed that I hadn't seen him for a few days. His complexion seemed a bit darker than before, and there was indeed a dusty feeling on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the man wearing a windbreaker, rolling up his sleeves, and standing up his collar still looked handsome and masculine. Moreover, he was also wearing a Rolex Submariner watch, which made him appear even stronger and more powerful, giving off a sense of being seasoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My feet were aching, and on top of that, I had just run too tired. At this moment, I had no strength left to speak. I wearily leaned against the chair, with my feet resting on Quinn's lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried that I had lost too much blood. His warm palm pressed against my ankle, and he found a clean white towel to temporarily wrap my foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I heard him make a phone call, not knowing who he was calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey buddy, do me a favor. Go to the intersection of Milne Street and Ferntree Avenue right now and look for four drunk men. I'll send you their photos. Once you find them, give them a good beating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that Quinn hadn't forgotten to teach those four drunks a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was touched and my perception of Quinn gradually changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I discovered that beneath his appearance of a spoiled child, he actually had a quite righteous and tender heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip stopped the car at this moment, I looked up and saw a clinic ahead with its lights on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, I will carry you down. You need to quickly remove the fragments and also get a tetanus shot, otherwise there is a risk of infection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn jumped out of the car and was about to carry me into the clinic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll walk by myself, you just support me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt awkward and torn between two choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt puzzled by me and teased me, saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have already hurt yourself like this, so don't be formal with me.Don't worry, you are not the type I like. Don't think that I will fall in love with you just because I have carried you on my back. Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could say anything, he grabbed both of my hands and pulled me directly onto his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very strong, even when carrying me on his back, he could walk briskly and quickly took me to the clinic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor at the clinic had not rested yet. Quinn briefly explained the situation to him, and upon hearing it, the doctor immediately disinfected me and said he would use tweezers to remove the fragments from the sole of my foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wound on the sole of my foot was very deep. By the time the doctor was wiping the wound with iodine, I was already feeling a lot of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in so much pain that my face turned pale. Seeing me like this, Quin decided to hold my head and let me lean against his waist. Then, he directly extended his arm in front of me and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you feel pain, bite me. It's okay, bite hard. I'm not afraid of pain."</span></p></div>
