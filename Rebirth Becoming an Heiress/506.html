        <h1>Chapter 506 Lost Contact With Quinn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Christmas. Many workers returned from coastal cities and brought the virus here. Now, the number of infections in Carthage is increasing. The hospital is overcrowded. The government has ordered a lockdown to avoid the spread. There is a serious shortage of supplies. Doctors and nurses have been up for several days and nights, and we urgently need material support. I came with the charity team to provide support. The supplies are still far from enough," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was worried and asked quickly, "I see. You must be careful! Are you okay now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine at the moment. I just have a cough, but it's okay. I'm strong. This little virus can't harm me," Quinn said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his relaxed voice, I said, "No matter what, you must be careful. This virus is more serious than any flu. You must pay attention!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when did you care about me so much?" Quinn teased, "Do you feel sorry for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a wry smile and then asked, "No way. Don't be ridiculous. By the way, do you need me to come and help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Are you going to come and cause more trouble? You are pregnant now. Just stay in Hoswich and be careful when you go out. Stay out of other matters," Quinn said. As soon as he finished speaking, there was a noise on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what happened, but I heard many people arguing excitedly. It sounded like there were a lot of people and something serious had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept calling Quinn's name. However, there was no response from him, and he hung up the phone not long after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called again but couldn't get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden change made me feel flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly called Adam and told him to immediately prepare 100,000 masks and 3,000 protective suits to be sent to Carthage People's Hospital. I also asked him to find Quinn and make sure he was fine before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam went to do his work immediately after receiving my call. Not long after, he arranged for someone to load the car and set off to Carthage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still worried about Quinn and couldn't stay at home, so I went to Glory Group. In the next few hours, I kept sending messages to Quinn, but he never replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so strange. Quinn had always replied to messages instantly. What happened this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a growing sense of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Adam had a smooth journey and arrived at the highway intersection of Carthage after a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam informed the staff of his intention, the staff let him go and allowed him to drive to Carthage People's Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been waiting for a message from Adam. When he arrived at Carthage People's Hospital, he immediately called me. "Madeline, I know why Quinn suddenly lost contact. There was a riot at the hospital a few hours ago. Several gangsters made a scene because they had a high fever and didn't receive timely medical treatment. As a result, many people were accidentally injured. The hospital is now in a mess. Medical staff and volunteers are in short. Quinn is probably helping. Don't worry. I'll transfer the supplies to the hospital first, and then I'll go find him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Adam's words, I felt disturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did something happen to Quinn, or did he accidentally drop the phone and lose contact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so anxious for a moment, but I had no choice but to sit passively in the office and wait.</span></p></div>
