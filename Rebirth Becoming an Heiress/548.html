        <h1>Chapter 548 He Is Drunk</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had arranged to meet Alexis for drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the video, it was evident that Elliott had already consumed a fair amount of alcohol. Alexis reached out to stop him. "Elliott, don't drink anymore. You'll get drunk like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott brushed off his hand. "You don't need to worry about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why shouldn't I worry? If you get drunk, I'll have to help you back," Alexis said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for your help. Trevor and my bodyguard are here," Elliott replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bottle after bottle, Elliott seemed unreachable. In the video, his expression was solemn as he continued pouring drink after drink down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare to see Elliott lose control like this, and it was unclear what had caused it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis asked him again, "Why are you drinking so much when everything's fine? If you can't let go, why not talk to her instead of drowning your sorrows here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lowered his gaze and muttered, "She... She divorced me and is carrying someone else's child. Alexis, she's so heartless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips tightened into a straight line, and intense emotions were buried deep in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video froze on his face, showing a desolate expression that looked heartbroken, as if he had been deeply wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following this, Alexis sent a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis: [Madeline, he truly loves you. I've never seen him like this before. If it's a misunderstanding, it's better to clear it up. Keeping it bottled up isn't good for either of you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading Alexis's message, I felt a surge of complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our situation had evolved beyond mere misunderstandings and couldn't be resolved with just a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed destined that Elliott and I were not meant to be. He had his dream lover, and I had my own path to walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, I replied to Alexis calmly: [Alexis, it's impossible between him and me. Take care of him and make sure he doesn't drink too much.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis didn't respond further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that for someone as composed and sober-minded as him, even a few emotional lines were rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, those who understood our situation knew that Elliott and I had a complicated history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at my phone, I realized it was almost midnight. Elliott was still out drinking. Shouldn't he be at home with the pregnant Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I pondered, my phone rang suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from an unfamiliar number. Who would be calling me at this hour?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although puzzled, I answered the call. To my surprise, the voice on the other end sounded very familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, long time no see," the person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this?" I asked, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You forgot my voice so soon? Your memory is really bad. It's me, Sylvia," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter echoed through the phone, accompanied by noisy background music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia? It had been a long, long time since I heard her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since being completely ousted by Elliott, I heard she had taken on a suspense-themed TV drama and gone off to the deep mountains to train with the crew. After that, I rarely heard any news about her, not even in the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you. What's up? Why are you calling me?" I asked, surprised.</span></p></div>
