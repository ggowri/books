        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip finally gave up on Paige and walked towards Elliott. At that moment, Alyssa was sitting on Elliott's lap, acting like a little girl. She picked up a glass of wine and seductively handed it to Elliott's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, cheer up. Come, let's have a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but glance at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa sat on Elliott's lap, facing towards us. She had heavy makeup on, making her face look beautiful and alluring, giving the impression that she was the kind of woman who could easily captivate people's hearts. I didn't know where Elliott had found such a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to drink with me?" Elliott asked coldly, "What makes you think you have the right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no expression on his face, so no one could guess what he was thinking at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa thought Elliott's words were an implication, so she became even suppler and leaned towards Elliott's chest. Her breasts almost pressed into his body. Then, she hooked her arms around his neck and coquettishly said, "Mr. Bryant, I'll do whatever </span><span>you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was sharp and seductive, making all of us feel nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona grumbled discontentedly, "Quinn, your club is truly full of talented people! Where did you find such a seductive woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled awkwardly and said, "Elliott brought her over. She is not from my club. I think it would be better if we go to another room. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the situation, Quinn strongly suggested that we change rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I had already understood what Elliott was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Quinn invited me here to celebrate, so Elliott immediately brought a woman with him. He did it just to make me feel uncomfortable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was still uncertain who would feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "We're not changing rooms, we'll stay here. Quinn, I'm a bit tired. Can I borrow your shoulder?" I said and immediately moved closer to Quinn, then without hesitation, I wrapped my arms around his arm and rested my head on his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden affectionate gesture shocked Quinn. However, he quickly understood and immediately reached out to embrace me. At the same time, Quinn lovingly touched my nose with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so stubborn? Fine, if you insist, we won't switch rooms. Come on, let's continue drinking. Let's stick to the old rule, Madeline and I will be a team, and you two will be a team. Shall we play dice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and Paige responded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the four of us started playing. The noise drowned out Alyssa's coquettish voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look at them again, but I could feel through the sound that Alyssa was trying her best to seduce Elliott, but I didn't hear any response from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to annoy Elliott, I constantly leaned my head on Quinn's shoulder. The two of us had a perfect understanding, and Fiona and Paige were no match for us at all. The strong understanding made us very happy, and we would occasionally high-five and celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn wholeheartedly cooperated with me in performing this affectionate act. In the heat of the moment, he even lowered his head and gently kissed my forehead...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden move made my heart flutter for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively looked up and met Quinn's gaze. And in that moment, for some reason, I felt like I was the only one in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Quinn really like me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was wondering, a piercing scream suddenly came from over there. All of us turned to look at them.</span></p></div>
