        <h1>Chapter 130 Heartache</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Quinn to be so dominant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't treat his arm as an arm at all, but stuffed it into my mouth like a chicken leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor disinfected the sole of my foot with iodine and then started to remove the fragments from my foot using tweezers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in so much pain that I broke out in a cold sweat. At the most unbearable moment, I couldn't control myself anymore and bit directly into Quinn's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't make any sound, not even moving his arms, and let me bite like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was covered in sweat, leaning against his waist, while his other hand was wrapped around my shoulder, giving me an inexplicable sense of security. With his support, I endured these long and painful minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the doctor at the clinic quickly treated my wound and removed all the fragments from the sole of my foot. Afterward, the doctor bandaged me up and administered a tetanus shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, how long do you think her foot will take to heal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip has been with us all along, and he asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to rest for about a week, and the wound should heal by then. I'll write a prescription, and when you go back, remember to help her change the dressing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor finished speaking, he wrote me a prescription and explained in detail the method of changing the medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the treatment was over, Quinn carried me back onto the off-road vehicle. It was only then that I noticed his arm, which had been bitten by me, had a bright red tooth mark. Moreover, his forehead was covered in fine sweat. Obviously, the process of being bitten by me must have been very painful for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really sorry, but could you go back and get another rabies shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a bit touched and guilty in my heart, with my head down, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I successfully made him laugh with my words. He pushed my head with his hand and said, "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you admit that you were a puppy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized that I had said the wrong thing, and I immediately felt embarrassed, my face turning red. I was so angry that I punched him in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I mean is, what if I had any germs that I transmitted to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn laughed heartily, and then he asked me with confusion, 'Why didn't you come to the party last night?'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You haven't told us what exactly happened, why were you being chased by a few hooligans barefoot on the street so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's question instantly made me feel down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should I answer him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I tell him that I had a fight with Elliott and once again he left me on the road? - I felt too embarrassed to tell him, so I remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn noticed that I didn't want to speak, so he said to Philip:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, there is still a distance to Madeline's house. You drive to your house first, and then I will drive her back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip turned his head and glanced at Quinn with a meaningful look, his eyes filled with a lot of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't say anything and just made an "OK" gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then I got off at the intersection ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Philip parked the car at the intersection ahead, he got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sat in the driver's seat and drove towards my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he would directly take me home, but to my surprise, after driving for a short distance, he stopped directly at the entrance of a tastefully decorated restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hejumped out ofthe car, opened the backseat door, and asked me to climb onto his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let me take you for some late-night snacks."</span></p></div>
