        <h1>Chapter 487 Give Birth to the Child</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, even though being pregnant is tough for me, I have decided to keep this baby," I told Lily honestly about my decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad and I also think the same way, it's just that you and Elliott..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily paused, looking at me, probably hesitant to bring up my past heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our marriage is over, this child has no connection to him or his family. This baby will have the last name Mayers, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held Lily's hand, smiling at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents had always cherished me, treating me like their treasure, but deep down, I knew that they might feel a bit regretful that I was a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who didn't want to have many descendants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing me say this, Lily couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't for that woman getting pregnant and causing so much trouble. Your pregnancy should have been a joyous occasion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Lily, speaking with determination. "Mom, the past is in the past. I don't want anyone to know this child is Elliott's. This child belongs to us, the Mayers family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily understood that my decision was influenced by the hurt caused by Elliott's parents and Cormac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I understand your reasons. Don't worry, don't overthink it. Whatever happens, your dad and I will always support you," Lily said seriously to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Lily's words, I felt warm inside and couldn't help but embrace her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about my parents' bankruptcy and their white hair in my past life, as well as the peacefulness of the present, I felt a mix of emotions and understood even more the preciousness of family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Lily, we went downstairs together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was drinking with Austin, watching Christmas programs that would be aired, discussing the country's political situation, and they seemed to be having a great time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me come downstairs, Marcus immediately stood up, looking happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're awake. That's great, it's not midnight yet, we can spend Christmas Eve together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over, sitting at the dining table, and smiled at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, these days you've been a great help. Lily told me already. You truly are our savior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say that! I can reunite and become neighbors with you, it's so fortunate. It's just some insignificant help, nothing special!" Marcus modestly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have been concerned about my weakness and quickly brought a cushion from the sofa to put behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and Lily noticed Marcus' care and attentiveness for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a look, and then Austin suddenly asked Marcus, "Marcus, why are you always alone? Are you married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mayers, I had a brief marriage before, but now I'm single. My parents followed my brother to another country to settle down, my brother has two kids who still need care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus honestly told Austin about his family situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment when Marcus said he was currently single, I could sense Austin's excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew what Austin was thinking, so I immediately pretended to cough, giving him a subtle hint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding my signal, Austin didn't probe further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lily brought a small bowl of herbal porridge prepared for me, smiling as she said, "This was made by Marcus himself, he estimated you would wake up around this time, just as he guessed. Marcus' medical skills are really amazing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the herbal porridge smelled a bit strange, it tasted surprisingly sweet, perfect for someone recovering from illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a few sips, feeling my appetite awakening. So, I ended up eating two bowls in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we cheerfully had dinner together, the doorbell rang.</span></p></div>
