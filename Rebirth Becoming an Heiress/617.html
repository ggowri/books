        <h1>Chapter 617 Threat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that she was a mother in the No. 1 VIP ward of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, who had just given birth to a son. Why did she want to commit suicide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. She was fine yesterday, looking very happy. She told us that she would get engaged to her fianc&eacute; and have a wedding once she was discharged from the hospital. Why did she suddenly want to commit suicide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she from your department? The man in front of her is her fianc&eacute;? Her fianc&eacute; is very handsome. Do you know what he does?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor knew, but we didn't. However, that child and her fianc&eacute; were nothing alike. Moreover, the child had wide-set eyes. I glanced at him and felt..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few nurses whispered. I was interested in what they were saying, so I approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was his eye distance wide? Could he be a Down syndrome child? Could she be contemplating suicide for this reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense. The doctors forbid us from discussing these things. They say the </span><span>child is still young, and his appearance will change as he grows up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurses were discussing. At this moment, a commotion came from behind the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and found that someone had informed the media. Several reporters carrying cameras and microphones walked over. They quickly aimed the cameras at Giselle and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer was in position, and Giselle immediately began her performance. She cried out, "Elliott, I have suffered so much to give birth to this child. You promised to marry me. Why do you suddenly want to send me and the child abroad? How can you be so cruel? Do you want our child to grow up without ever seeing his father?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the journalist arrived, Giselle's voice became noticeably louder. She cried out and walked barefoot near the railing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind on the rooftop was strong, and she was trembling in her white dress. The oversized white dress made her bulky figure appear thin, as if she could be blown away by the wind at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott told Giselle that he wanted to send her and the child abroad, so she resisted in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had just given birth to a baby through a cesarean section. She was very brave, walking barefoot near the railing in the cold wind. She was not afraid that her body couldn't handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, please. Giselle gave birth to a son for you. You can't treat them like this. She is my only daughter. If Giselle jumps from here, I will also jump."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a woman rushed out from the crowd. She grabbed onto Elliott's thigh and began wailing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that voice. She was Giselle's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mother and daughter started performing. I guessed Elliott would compromise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona crossed her arms, pursed her lips, and watched the scene unfolding before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two people wanted to commit suicide. It was difficult for such a method of threat to not succeed," I coldly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an onlooker, I stood in the crowd and watched the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, I already knew the ending. At that moment, the police approached Elliott and said something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, I heard Elliott shouting at Giselle, "Alright, I promise I won't send you and the child abroad. Come down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott tried to approach again. However, Giselle waved her hand and shouted, "Elliott, shall we get engaged? We have a son now. Don't you want to give our son a complete family?"</span></p></div>
