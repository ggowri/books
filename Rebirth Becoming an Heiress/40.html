        <h1>Chapter 40 Expensive Dress</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott with confusion, but he didn't explain anything further and pulled me into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby was still the driver, and after I got in the car, the sweet-sounding pop music was playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott used to listen to classical music before. It was the first time I heard pop music in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a little skeptical that Toby had switched to the wrong channel. Just as I was about to remind him, Elliott suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you like this singer very much? I specifically asked Toby to find a few of his songs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to put in effort for me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, so what even if he tried his best? Tomorrow, he was going to meet the woman he was destined to love all his life...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was originally a little touched. But thinking about this, I didn't find it moved at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and casually played with my phone. Unexpectedly, a piece of news popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant Group invested a huge amount of money to acquire the copyright of Allure. It is reported that the drama will be starring Sylvia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I had become numb, but when I saw this news, I still felt like my heart was being fiercely torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't had a decent evening gown in the past two years. Tonight, I'll take you to pick out one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not notice my expression. He sat beside me and whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it. He suddenly felt guilty, wanting to make some compensation to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but sneer in my heart. I didn't look up, still staring at my phone, opening the news to read the specific details. I realized that this incident had only happened in the past few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that during the week when I hadn't seen him, he and Sylvia had become a lot closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't know what he was going to do when Giselle showed up. Could it be that he wanted to be with three women at the same time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this compensation for me, Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head, deliberately suppressing my inner emotions, and forced a smile as I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow is very important, and the woman standing by my side must be presentable. Madeline, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're afraid that I'll embarrass you, you can take Sylvia there. Since you've even bought plays specifically for her and made her the leading lady, why not let her be the heroine at tomorrow's party as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't plan to be jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I obviously didn't want to say anything embarrassing to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for no reason, prompted by the inexplicable emotion in my heart, I couldn't help but burst out with these sarcastic and jealous words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that I still needed to practice. I wasn't calm enough, not composed enough, and I still couldn't control my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not up to you. Madeline, if you continue to be reckless and capricious as used to be, then this will be the first and also the last time I take you to a public event."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, my words did not make him feel guilty. On the contrary, I once again provoked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally assumed that I was still the same as before, only capable of throwing tantrums and unpresentable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really wanted to swear in my heart. I wanted to get angry and get out of the car immediately, and tell him that I wouldn't attend the banquet. He could invite anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the thought of tomorrow as the most important turning point of my fate, and the thought that Giselle was about to appear, I could only silently suppress my anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been practicing the piano so hard for such a long time, I couldn't let my efforts be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held back my anger and agreed. I didn't say another word to him and wearily leaned back in the chair, turning my head to look out at the street scene outside the window.</span></p></div>
