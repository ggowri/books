        <h1>Chapter 105 Game</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when others saw me teasing Quinn, everyone quickly gathered around as if they had discovered something exciting. They soon suggested playing Truth or Dare together. The loser had to either choose to drink alcohol or put ice cubes down their collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gameplay was exciting, and everyone immediately responded, with everyone joining in one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn placed an empty bottle in the middle of the table, and everyone took turns spinning it. Whoever the bottle pointed to, that person had to answer a question, and furthermore, the person answering had to tell the truth, or else they would be cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game started, and Quinn quickly spun the beer bottle. However, to my surprise, after a few spins, the bottle unexpectedly pointed towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn grinned at me, looking as if he was about to seek revenge for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he rubbed his hands together and suddenly asked me a question that was difficult for me to speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me, "Madeline, when was your first time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This problem... is really embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in front of so many people, could I possibly admit that I, a married person for two years, am still a virgin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could never tell anyone about such an embarrassing thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if I didn't tell the truth, I would have to face the punishment of a big adventure. For a moment, I felt extremely embarrassed and wished I could find a hole to hide in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at Quinn fiercely and said, "Quinn, can't you stop being so weird?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was laughing uncontrollably at this point: "Please don't tell us that you're still a virgin, are you? If that's the case, then I really have to question Elliott's abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was probably the only one in the entire room who dared to openly question Elliott in this regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn said these words, the others couldn't hold back their laughter any longer and burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you wait for me, retribution will come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I angrily uttered a sentence and then, without saying a word, grabbed the ice bucket on the table and poured it all over myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of the ice bucket being poured all over me was truly bone-chilling and exhilarating. I shivered all over from the cold, and Fiona quickly draped a blanket over me. Then she turned to Quinn and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, you wait, the next one is guaranteed to be yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recovering, I picked up the beer bottle on the table and started spinning it. This bottle is really magical, as it spun around, it actually landed on Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opportunity for revenge has come, and I became excited all of a sudden. I laughed and shouted:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, look, it came!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona were also excited, and they immediately gathered around me. Then, Paige leaned in close to my ear and whispered:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you just ask him, when was the last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood it in an instant and couldn't help but chuckle. However, I really couldn't bring myself to ask such an embarrassing question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I may appear unrestrained, but deep down I am still somewhat traditional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw me smiling mischievously but didn't ask any questions. So, she casually said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I'm here to ask questions on behalf of Madeline. When was the last time you did something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, as always, was a regular at nightclubs. She asked these questions without any shame, effortlessly. I truly admire her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paige asked this, several men instantly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip couldn't help but joke, "Do I even need to ask? Quinn was definitely partying every night, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately turned their gaze to Quinn, and everyone was particularly eager to see what kind of answer he would give...</span></p></div>
