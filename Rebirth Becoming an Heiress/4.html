        <h1>Chapter 4 Move</h1>
        <div><p>After leaving the Bryant Group, I returned to my parents&#x27; house and lived in the room they had always reserved for me.</p><p>My mother got a brand new quilt for me. The scent of sunshine on the quilt made me sleep particularly sweetly.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t go back to my home with Elliott, and I didn&#x27;t know if he had ever looked for me. I even didn&#x27;t care if he would.</p><p>Early the following day, I received a call from Sean West, the butler.</p><p>&quot;Mrs. Bryant, you didn&#x27;t come back last night. Where have you been?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m at my parents&#x27; house.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well. Mr. Bryant asked about you when he came back last night. Mrs. Bryant, you two, quarreled?&quot;</p><p>Sean asked me cautiously on the phone. In fact, during two years of marriage, only Sean had been silently caring about me.</p><p>&quot;Yes. Please tell him that I won&#x27;t go back, and I&#x27;ll pick a time to take away my things,&quot; I spoke calmly.</p><p>&quot;Mrs. Bryant, what&#x27;s wrong? I know that sometimes, Mr. Bryant has gone too far, but marriage is a tough journey. As long as you are together, things will gradually get better.&quot;</p><p>Sean heard that I wanted to move out and became a little emotional.</p><p>&quot;It won&#x27;t get better. He doesn&#x27;t love me, and you all know that.&quot;</p><p>I smiled bitterly, no longer had any expectations, and hung up the phone.</p><p>There was a time when I couldn&#x27;t leave Elliott for hours without thinking about where he was, who he was with, and what he was doing. It was hard not being around him. I couldn&#x27;t have left him for more than a day.</p><p>But now, whatever.</p><p>I was completely awake and didn&#x27;t care anymore. Where Elliott was and who he was with had nothing to do with me.</p><p>For the rest of my life, I just wanted to take it easy, do what I wanted, be sober, self-loving, and no longer lost.</p><p>I got up and opened the closet. Looking at the neatly arranged old clothes, I couldn&#x27;t help but smile.</p><p>Before marrying Elliott, I was a rebellious girl. At that time, I liked motorcycle clothes, jeans with rivets, cool and unique dresses, and short hair.</p><p>But later, learning that Elliott liked gentle and lovely girls with long hair, I gave up all these clothes and replaced them with long skirts and dresses that I had never enjoyed. I even stopped cutting my hair and let it grow long.</p><p>Why bother deliberately catering to others&#x27; preferences? People who loved you would love you no matter what you looked like.</p><p>I picked out a short black T-shirt and a pair of ripped jeans from the closet, took out my favorite canvas shoes, dressed them up, put on a little makeup, and then went straight to the barbershop.</p><p>Soon, with the skillful barber, my waist-length hair turned into neat collarbone-length hair, and the bangs in the front also turned into see-through bangs.</p><p>I looked at my new look in the mirror and suddenly felt much more relaxed and refreshed.</p><p>Just then, my phone rang.</p><p>I picked up the phone and saw that it was my best friend, Paige Ford, calling...</p><p>&quot;Madeline, where are you? Come and stay with me. I feel terrible.&quot;</p><p>The call was connected, and Paige&#x27;s feeble voice came from the other end.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m at the barbershop. Where are you? I&#x27;m on my way,&quot; I answered without hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Neon Club. Come quickly. I&#x27;m waiting for you.&quot;</p></div>
