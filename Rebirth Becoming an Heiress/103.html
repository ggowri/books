        <h1>Chapter 103 Arrangements</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle heard Elliott say this, and she was instantly disappointed. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something more, but perhaps knowing that she was in the wrong, she didn't say anything and left sulkily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, bring the contract to our Purchasing Department tomorrow. The flower arrangement this time has received unanimous praise from the VIP group. Leave the professional matters to the professionals, I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know whether Elliott was praising me this time or truly acknowledging Paige's team's flower arrangement skills, but he didn't hesitate and readily agreed to sign a contract with Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected this result at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally thought Giselle had it in the bag this time, but little did I know, she would make such a big mistake in the first major event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, it was really that even the heavens couldn't bear witness to my past life's misfortunes, so this life also unhesitatingly stood by my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, no problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being able to achieve this cooperation is certainly a good start for Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was extremely happy, so she insisted on dragging me to Quinn's club to celebrate that evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige has now become a regular at the Quinn Club. When she is there, she feels more at ease than when she is at her own home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened a private room and took me to get high, and called Fiona and her group of friends who often eat and drink with her, organized a game, and called for the most expensive champagne to celebrate the success of her signing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige so happy, I felt particularly gratified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at the time when we were having the most fun, Quinn appeared in our box with Philip and Alexis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn still had his trendy casual attire, and this time, he even wore a row of diamond earrings on his left ear. His hairstyle had also been groomed, making him look very hip and youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Philip arrived, he joined Paige and the two of them started playing dice games, with their shoulders touching and arms linked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a lawyer, Alexis seemed a bit aloof. However, two girls approached him and struck up a conversation, and he didn't resist. He started playing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held a glass of wine and walked out to the terrace, intending to take a breath and have a look at the street view outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not long after, Quinn also came out with a glass of wine in his hand. He stood beside me, looking at me with a smile on his face, and suddenly asked me a question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How was it? Was today's schedule wonderful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What arrangement is wonderful or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand what he meant at first, and I looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn raised his glass and lightly tapped it against mine. Then, he took a sip of his drink and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it was the arrangement of Giselle's absence, do you think it was just a coincidence? Did you think it was divine intervention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly opened my mouth in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea that Giselle was aware of this, and from the way he spoke, it seemed like he not only knew about it but also intentionally arranged it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my bewildered face, he then used his finger to scratch my nose. Afterward, he smiled and said, "..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Giselle intentionally skipped it? It was me who gave Rowan two concert tickets from Alexis and instructed Rowan to surprise Giselle. As a result, Rowan tricked Giselle into going out of town at the last minute, causing her to miss this important reception event by Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it turns out that all of this was actually Quinn's deliberate arrangement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how would he know that I didn't want Giselle and Elliott to interact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how could he know so much about everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I looked at Quinn as if he were an alien. I had countless questions in my mind about him, and I increasingly felt like he was a prophet, already knowing so much about things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why was he suddenly willing to be friends with me and go out of his way to help me time and time again?</span></p></div>
