        <h1>Chapter 644 He Wants to See Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched the numbers jumping on the screen, my heart raced uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and then, pretending to be calm, answered the phone with an indifferent tone, "Hello? What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, his voice remained calm as usual, making it impossible to detect any emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat in the car and saw him standing at the door, looking around as if searching for someone's figure. This made me inevitably nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively lied, "I am at home, what's wrong? Do you need anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to see you, Madeline. Send me your location and I will come to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice came through the phone once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already stopped loving him. But at this moment, when I heard that Elliott was coming to see me, I instinctively clenched my fist and felt that suffocating sensation in my chest, surging up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his tone, it didn't seem he had spotted me at the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't feel relaxed. On the contrary, I felt even heavier in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, this was a trap set by Giselle and her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were not for that, Elliott and I would not have reached the point of divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this does not mean that he could be forgiven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were not for his indulgence, all this would not have evolved to the irreparable extent it is today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Elliott had always used Cormac's good health as an excuse. But throughout, only he knew how many selfish reasons he had hidden regarding Giselle's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a person truly loved another person, they wouldn't be able to marry other people, and they wouldn't cheat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott failed this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that he did not love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at this moment, after knowing the truth, Elliott wanted to see me, wanted to come find me. But what does this represent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and then refused over the phone, "It's too late and not very convenient. Besides, tonight is your engagement banquet, why are you looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew the result, but I couldn't help but sarcastically speak to him on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott really didn't care about Giselle or her child, how could he possibly get engaged to Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was convinced that everything was just his excuse, all because he didn't love me enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The engagement has been called off, and the person I want to see the most right now is you, Madeline. I have so much to tell you," Elliott whispered into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I saw him with one hand leaning on the column at the entrance of the hotel, frowning and looking outside with a slight sense of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of being physically close but emotionally distant, made me feel suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wanted to talk to me. What did he want to say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he want to pretend that everything was like before, telling me that the engagement was canceled, that he didn't have any mistress anymore? Would he hug me, kiss me, and sleep together with me then? Did he think that would cover up everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, I was no longer the same person as before. I would never allow myself to be controlled by him so easily again. I wouldn't be drawn to him like a moth to a flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's canceled, huh? That's really unfortunate. There's no need for us to meet then. It's really late, and I'm not available," I said slowly into the phone. There was still a hint of sarcasm in my tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Giselle is no longer the obstacle between us. I want to go back to the way things were and see you again. Can I meet you, just once? Right now, I really want to see you."</span></p></div>
