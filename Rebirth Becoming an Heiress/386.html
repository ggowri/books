        <h1>Chapter 386 Dream Lover</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd been quiet for a while, and Adam seemed a bit thrown off. "Madeline, why the radio silence? Everything okay? I know Giselle's pregnancy news must've hit hard. And with the chairman still out of commission, I didn't want to bug you with work stuff. If you're feeling down, we could chill or hit up a bar. I've got your back, whatever you need."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam caught wind of Giselle's pregnancy, and it just added to my already heavy mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, how'd you even find out about it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rowan told me. Poor guy had no clue why Giselle dumped him, then he found out she's pregnant. Giselle's been spreading news to our buddies, saying it's Mr. Bryant's. So, tell me, are you and Mr. Bryant?" Adam's voice sounded jittery on the line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hand holding the phone started shaking at his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Adam. You and Netflix need to duke it out again. But hey, make sure Allure doesn't snatch up that Christmas prime time." I dodged Adam's question, steering straight back to work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Copy that. But, Madeline, with Bryant Group's firepower, stopping them might be a tall order," Adam replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever it takes!" I shot back into the phone. Adam was taken aback by the sudden edge in my tone. He quickly agreed, and we hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hopped out of the car and swung by a nearby shop to casually grab a pair of shades and a cap, then hustled back to Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd made up my mind to go back and check if the girl was Jezebel and if she was visiting Giselle. Plus, I wanted to see firsthand how Elliott was treating Giselle when I wasn't around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stealthily made my way to the door of Giselle's ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had hooked her up in the VIP ward, so the hallway was deserted and hushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the family documents Elliott set up for my pops, I could waltz in and out of Bryant Hospital like no big deal. Doctors and nurses stopped giving me the third degree once they saw my papers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door to Giselle's room was wide open, so I crept up and peeked inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spotted Elliott chilling by Giselle's bed, with a girl in the duckbill cap posted up beside her, holding Giselle's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bingo. That had to be Jezebel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that confirmed, I planted myself by the door and tuned into their conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jez, what brings you here? Aren't you busy with Allure's release? Thought you'd be swamped with promo stuff," Giselle's voice floated out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you got hospitalized, so I had to squeeze in some time to check on you and the little bun in the oven. Plus, seeing Mr. Bryant all worried and sticking by your side personally... kinda puts my mind at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel's voice came through, a bit hoarse. It totally threw me off, considering her usual ice queen vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Elliott's been glued to me since the accident, even skipped out on today's big company meeting," Giselle added, her voice tinged with shyness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't shouting it from the rooftops, but anyone could hear the joy in her words loud and clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kept yapping about not giving a damn, but here he was, stuck to her like glue. If that wasn't enough proof, I didn't know what was.</span></p></div>
