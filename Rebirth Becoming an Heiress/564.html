        <h1>Chapter 564 Give a Speech</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle had bled so many times, and there were issues with the embryo. Could her child still have been born healthy?" I couldn't help but furrow my brow, silently praying for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it wasn't me who had angered her anyway, so I didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, Quinn, let's go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed my coat from the chair and left the shop with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we stepped out the door, I felt like someone was watching me from behind. I instinctively glanced back but saw nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I quickly exited the alley and left in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Sylvia sent me another message, a picture. In the photo, Elliott's silhouette towered. He stood by the window, parting the curtains, peering through the crack at the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the image, Sylvia added a line: [I feel that Elliott still cares about you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia didn't seem as annoying as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could now speak such rational words, and it seemed she wasn't as obsessed with Elliott as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whether he cared about me or not, I no longer cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pregnancy symptoms gradually eased, I started to view pregnancy less as something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I approached both pregnancy and work with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went about my daily routine at the Glory Group, and to maintain my figure, I joined a yoga class and hired a personal trainer for targeted prenatal exercises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my father's recovery, he returned to work at the Glory Group. Under his guidance, I quickly familiarized myself with the company's basic operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To groom me as his successor, my father not only shared his knowledge generously but also constantly took me to various events, introducing me to all his connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly enjoyed this busy yet fulfilling feeling. Though sometimes fatigued, this sense of fulfillment left me little time to dwell on elusive matters like love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month flew by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new strain of flu&nbsp;that broke out during Christmas had been gradually contained, having initially been uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thanked for the miraculous efficacy of the anti-flu capsule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that the small act of saving Quinn by going to Carthage would have such a vast butterfly effect in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the successful promotion of this capsule in Carthage, it garnered widespread media coverage. Soon, it became known nationwide and was clinically used in major hospitals. It not only effectively curbed the spread of the virus but also brought Tigress Pharmacy Company and the Glory Group to prominence in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much the Bryant Group spent advertising their antiviral oral solution, they couldn't achieve this level of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this victory in the medical field, my Glory Group surpassed the Bryant Group in market value for the first time in history, becoming the top company in all of Hoswich's enterprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of glory had never been achieved by my father in all the years he founded the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day Hoswich Financial Magazine announced the rankings, my father was thrilled and repeatedly praised me as a business genius who could accurately seize opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, I received a call from Cathy, the chief editor of Hoswich Financial Magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I'm Cathy, the chief editor of Hoswich Financial Magazine. Do you have a moment to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Cathy, I'm available. Please, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, we'd love to have you as a guest on our upcoming Lotus Forum. We want you to share your entrepreneurial journey with young business minds across the city and beyond. Are you up for it?"</span></p></div>
