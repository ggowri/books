        <h1>Chapter 306 Lock the Target</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I was blocking someone's path, so I hastily stepped aside. But then Quinn's voice came from behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so early, are you guys just showing love on the side of the road?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around in dismay to see that it was Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he happened to get out of his extremely tall off-road vehicle and whistled at me before wittily flirting with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had probably just arrived at the hospital and happened to catch a glimpse of Elliott and me saying goodbye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why are you here?" I asked with a surprised smile as I jogged over to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was he here with you last night?" Quinn teased with his arms wrapped around him, "Elliott has made some improvements. He has got a little bit of self-consciousness about being your husband now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I wasn't expecting that." I laughed, then somewhat sheepishly pulled my hair back from my forehead to the back of my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like the breakfast I brought is going to waste."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn raised the bag he was carrying in his hand again. Originally, he brought some sandwiches and milk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom hasn't had breakfast yet. How did the food you brought get wasted?" I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, we both went to Fiona's office together. Lily was already up when we arrived. She had just finished washing up in the room next to Fiona's office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I handed Lily the breakfast. Later, we walked out of the hospital together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, wanting to say something. I had a feeling that there was something he wanted to say to me. So I offered to go sit in his car for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as we got in the car, Quinn said to me, "Madeline, the driver who caused the accident has been found. It's just ......"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly tensed, asking, "Just what?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sighed heavily, "He committed suicide. His body was found by the police last night. I just got the news this morning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn incredulously, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect that someone is targeting your family. Madeline, you have to be careful. Especially don't let the Glory Group be controlled by others while your dad is in a coma," Quinn looked at me and said solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to smell a conspiracy as well, or else Quinn wouldn't have said such things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, feeling more and more like the whole thing was a conspiracy. I especially thought that in the last life, Jade and Tom ended up devouring the entire Glory Group, while my family faced the end of a broken situation. I was getting more and more jittery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I hope you help me check the family and background of this driver for me again. You look for any other clues," I said to Quinn once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you be careful. You should call me first if anything happens," Quinn said in a hushed voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I chatted in his car for a while. I then touched up my makeup and set off directly to the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin suddenly had such an accident and the situation at the Glory Group is what worries me the most nowadays.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Katrina called me early in the morning. She told me that Jade had announced the news that Austin was in a coma due to a car accident in the leader's group last night and called for an early morning meeting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina called specifically to ask about Austin. I briefly confided in her on the phone, and afterward, I asked her directly, "Katrina, what do you think of Jade?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By virtue of the last time I helped her daughter enroll in a major high school, Katrina and I were already on good personal terms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point in time, I knew in my heart that I needed to rely on Katrina and a few of the company's employees to take control of the Glory Group as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina hesitated for a few seconds on the other end of the phone. She then said, "Madeline, no matter what, several of our experienced employees have followed Mr. Austin Mayers all the way to this point. We only recognize Mr. Austin Mayers and you. We don't care about anyone else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina's words gave me instant confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without needing to say anything more, I hung up the phone and headed straight to the office.</span></p></div>
