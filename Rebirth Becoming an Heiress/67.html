        <h1>Chapter 67 She Just Loved You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This speech, as if it came from the depths of my soul, was a protest and a cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clearly wanted to laugh. I never wanted to show even a hint of vulnerability in front of him. However, at the moment when I finished shouting, I suddenly realized that tears were streaming down my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I shouted out those words, all the grievances I have endured over the years, all the anger I have suppressed within me, were released little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clenched my hands tightly and bit my lip. Tears streamed down my face as I gazed at the man standing before me with a proud posture. My heart, riddled with countless wounds, felt as if it was bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those abscesses that had accumulated in my heart in the past, at this moment, all burst open. In an instant, pain spread throughout my whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me thoughtfully. Then, he instinctively approached me. He reached out his hand, wanting to wipe away the tears on my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I instinctively stepped back like a wounded animal facing a hunter. I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come over. I don't need your pity or sympathy. Elliott, I used to love you. That was my own business. Now, I don't love you anymore. That's also my own business. In the past, I was the one who kept this marriage together. Now, I will be the one to end it. I don't regret that I once loved you. But listen carefully, from today onwards, I am no longer the person I used to be. I will not love you even a bit! Elliott, my love, is dead. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tears flowed like a raging flood. I shouted while stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that at that time, I was probably seen as a lunatic in the eyes of others. Countless patients or their family members who came and went probably thought that I had escaped from a mental hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only I myself knew what I was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My legs were getting weak. My body was trembling incessantly. My tears were falling down like broken beads. I let out all the last suppressed emotions from my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at the same time, I also found redemption in such cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was clearly shocked. He probably never expected me to shout these words at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me blankly. When I saw a flicker of pain on his face, I almost thought it was my imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw my vulnerability and sadness. So, he instinctively walked up to me. He reached out his hand again, wanting to support me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I quickly waved my hand. I desperately stepped back. I desperately tried to keep my distance from him. At the same time, I desperately tried to calm down my excited emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wiped away the tears from my face. Afterward, I looked at him solemnly and reiterated,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I am seriously proposing a divorce to you, please consider it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our marriage no longer needed to linger on in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I was willing to let go. I only wanted to get divorced from him as soon as possible. I wanted to regain a new life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he looked at me, his lips moved. He wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn't say it. He just stood there, silently watching me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was our arguing that startled Giselle. Somehow, Giselle and Quinn found themselves standing at the door of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn saw that I seemed unable to stand steady, he couldn't hold back any longer. He rushed over, bypassing Elliott, and immediately grabbed me for support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you ever thought that these past few years, which you have disregarded, were the most beautiful youth for a woman? She only loved you, but she didn't commit any crime. You shouldn't treat her so harshly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at Elliott and said these words, one by one. Afterward, he turned around and firmly grabbed my arm. He firmly said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we left!"</span></p></div>
