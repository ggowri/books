        <h1>Chapter 432 Madness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to form, Elliott remained unshaken. A few provoking words couldn't dent his usual pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him and continued to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diaries? Those are ancient history. Elliott, all emotions have an expiration date. My love for you has long expired. Please stop comparing the past to the present. We live in the now. Please be mature, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott squinted at me, his eyes burning with barely contained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Expired? Have you forgotten the madness between us just recently? Madeline, do you need me to jog your memory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his words, shockingly and without any regard for the fact that we were in a public restroom at a restaurant, he reached out and grabbed the edge of my tube top, attempting to pull it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was horrified and quickly pressed his hand down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you lost your mind? Are you really going to act like a thug here?" I whispered furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been neglecting me for a long time. Discharging Austin from the hospital without my knowledge, moving houses, inviting men over for dinner. I've let all that slide." Elliott threatened, "But, Madeline, I've given you enough face. You better take this chance to back off, or don't blame me for not being nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath. Lifting my head, I looked straight into his eyes, now tinged with a crimson rage. I knew Elliott was desperate, yet I couldn't help but snicker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scoffed, "Elliott, I don't need your concessions. I've said it before, just mention divorce and I'll sign the papers anytime! And please, stop harassing me whenever you feel like it. I'm sick of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This infuriated Elliott instantly. He closed in on me, his towering frame engulfing me as he did not attempt to hide the desire and malice in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh really? Well, I'm not tired of this. I've told you, I will never divorce you! You provoke me like this, do you believe I could just take you right here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was ice-cold. Before I could react, he suddenly pulled me forcefully into the men's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott casually pushed open one of the doors and locked it behind us. Then, he cornered me against the wall, his eyes brimming with endless desire. He stared at me, his hands wrapping tightly around my waist, pulling me close into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you've truly lost your mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined he could grow more unhinged by the moment. A strong sense of danger enveloped me instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bit my lip, looking at him, my voice trembling as much as my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, I am the one going mad, you're driving me insane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingertips caressed my face, his eyes like a predator fixated on its prey, almost ready to devour me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott leaned in again and tried to kiss me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I punched him in the face. Staring at him, my eyes just as fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said forcefully, "Elliott, the one about to go insane isn't you, it's me! If you dare treat me like this again, I can't guarantee what I'll do next!"</span></p></div>
