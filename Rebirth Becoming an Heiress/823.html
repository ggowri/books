        <h1>Chapter 823: Are You Telling The Truth?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn instantly read my gaze. His expression turned desolate in a heartbeat. He looked utterly dispirited, even his words lacked energy:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suddenly, I remembered I have some unfinished business in Norch City. You two go ahead. Since Elliott is okay, I'll take my leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn finished speaking, then turned and walked out of the hospital room, a picture of desolation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his retreating figure, for some reason, I felt a touch of emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout this journey, Quinn has truly done so much for me, and endured so much. And what I've done for him is just too little.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I couldn't help but rise to my feet and chase after it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was moving fast. By the time I dashed out, his figure was nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sprinted all the way to the hospital entrance before I finally caught a distant glimpse of him heading towards where he parked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yelled out in a panic, then hurriedly chased after.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of my shout, Quinn spun around in surprise. When he saw me chasing after him, his face was filled with an expression of utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how come you're out here? Weren't you supposed to stay back and look after him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood there, asking me in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got a few words to share with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I too stood before him, swiftly adjusting my breath. Then, I lifted my gaze to Quinn, speaking earnestly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what is it you want to tell me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked somewhat perplexed. Standing before me under the gentle sunlight, the dazzling gleam from the black diamond stud in his ear was enough to make me slightly dizzy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you ask me to think it over and then give you an answer?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath, slowly addressing Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then what happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing something, a look of tension crossed Quinn's face. I could feel his entire body seemingly tense up all at once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was locked on me, eagerly awaiting my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made up my mind," I said, staring into his dark eyes, "Once Elliott recovers, once I've repaid my debt to him, I... I'll be with you. We'll raise Noah together. Even though Noah isn't related to you by blood, I trust that you'll treat him well. And I... I yearn for a peaceful life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally voiced out the words that had been lingering in my mind for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, I had been weighing it up for a long, long time. But prior to this, I always felt I lacked the courage to make this decision.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I truly can't bear to see Quinn constantly stepping back for me, hurting for me. And yet, he continues to treat me well without asking for anything in return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been utterly moved by his sincerity, kindness, and wholesome charm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing someone who's so devotedly good to me, it would be utterly unfair if I still reject them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn froze, as if he'd been hit with a paralysis spell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me blankly, his eyes filled with profound disbelief. It took him several seconds before he seemed to finally snap back to reality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of elation swept over him in an instant, and he couldn't help but lay his hand on my shoulder. His tone shifted, brimming with joy and excitement:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you for real? You've figured it out? You truly want to be with me?"</span></p></div>
