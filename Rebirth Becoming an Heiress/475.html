        <h1>Chapter 475 Experience</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled in agreement. Then, suddenly, he changed the subject. After saying this meaningful sentence, he glanced deeply at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he actually go to pick up the note?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he saw my confession written on the note back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt like a child caught red-handed by an adult. It was something from many years ago, yet I couldn't help but blush involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively lowered my head. The air seemed to freeze instantly. Even time seemed to stop flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus noticed my embarrassed state. He suddenly burst into a hearty laugh as if intentionally breaking the tension. Then, he affectionately patted my head and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been quite a few years. I didn't anticipate you blushing like that still. I was merely teasing. I didn't go to retrieve it. The wall was too tall; how could I have scaled it? But observing your reaction just now, could it be those notes you penned back then were your confessions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' playful tone changed my mood instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah... It's been so many years. Back then, I was just an ignorant and naive girl. Even if I had feelings for boys, it was normal. There was no need to be shy about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought about this, I suddenly felt more relaxed. I laughed again and pretended to be angry as I playfully nudged his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? I wouldn't do such a thing. The notes were all filled with nonsense about you, haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed again, and Marcus visibly relaxed. He chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess so. Otherwise, why would you get so mad at me all the time? But blame it on my parents. They insisted on sending me to the military. Otherwise, we might have ended up in the same university, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, everyone in the class was surprised when you suddenly enlisted. By the way, how long were you in the army?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About six years. Later, I met my ex-wife. After we got married, I retired. I founded the current Tigress Pharmacy Company. But starting a business from scratch is really not easy. I've been through a lot of hardships these years. Fortunately, the difficulties are behind me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I didn't know how difficult running a business was until my dad got sick this time. My family's company has been running for many years, and it's still like this. Not to mention you started from scratch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Marcus and couldn't help but feel a hint of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Getting started is always the toughest part. But once you take that step, it gets easier. When the opportunity arises, I'll share my experiences over the years with you. It's late now, and you're not as healthy as before. You should rest soon. Let's go, I'll accompany you to my pharmacy to pick up some medicine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus checked the time and then stood up, gesturing for me to follow him to his home pharmacy.</span></p></div>
