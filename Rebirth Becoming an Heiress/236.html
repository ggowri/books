        <h1>Chapter 236 Shameless</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean you stayed in Serenity Villa and slept in my bed last night? Giselle, you're shameless."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost couldn't help but curse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was young, yet she made seduction sound so usual.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took two steps forward and cornered her instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't!" She looked at me pitifully, seeming afraid of me. She said, "It was just... It was just too late, and Elliott asked me to stay in the guest bedroom. Don't get me wrong. Nothing happened between Elliott and me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guest bedroom was where I often slept. And Elliott also slept there too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of our house being tainted with this woman's scent immediately made me feel sick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a lot of my personal belongings in the guest bedroom. Did she use them all last night and fantasize about becoming the mistress of that house one day?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she take a shower in my bathroom and wipe herself with my towel?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How disgusting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't eat much for breakfast, but I instantly felt nauseous now. I stepped forward, moving very close to her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly, "Giselle, I know what you are up to, but let me tell you. You will never be with Elliott in this life because I will not let you surpass me. So, you better give up early!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost gritted my teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became angrier, especially when I thought about her arrogance before me from the last life to the later days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hated my incompetence in my previous life, and I was angry that even though I had so much leverage, Giselle took away everything that belonged to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the closer I got to her, the more disgusting I felt. I felt there was an uncontrollable force in my body. If I hadn't kept telling myself I was civilized, I might have hit her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that while I was trying to restrain myself, Giselle suddenly pushed me hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said emotionally, "Madeline, what are you talking about? Who do you think I am? I am nothing like what you said. Besides, even if Elliott falls in love with me one day, it must be because you are not worthy of his love. He often told me many bad things about you. Instead of judging me, you should reflect on your own problems!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott often told her all kinds of bad things about me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott treat her as a confidante?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank for a moment. I admitted that no matter how strong I made myself become, Giselle's words could instantly break through all my defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought everything I had done in this life had made Elliott look at me differently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never expected that Elliott would think I was not good enough behind my back and not worthy of him. He even complained about me to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How badly did he degrade me behind my back?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became angrier and grabbed Giselle's collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked sternly, "Really? What bad things did he tell you about me? Tell me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked like she was scared by me again, but her tone didn't suggest that she was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A lot. He said you were selfish and had a bad figure. He said that he didn't love you at all and that he married you just for the benefit of his family. Elliott also said you were superficial and had nothing in common with you. He would want to quarrel with you when he talked to you. He said he would divorce you sooner or later. By the way, Elliott suspected you couldn't get pregnant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unimaginable that these harsh words were actually spoken by Giselle, who looked pretty and kind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was very low, but I heard every word clearly. Every word was destroying the self-confidence I had finally built up.</span></p></div>
