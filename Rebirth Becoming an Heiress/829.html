        <h1>Chapter 829: A Trio's Journey</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I refuse to believe this is a coincidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gut tells me, Lisa must have found out about Elliott's flight details first. That's why she booked the same flight, even managing to get a seat right behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just didn't expect me to show up, throwing all her plans into disarray.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's really into Elliott, isn't she?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time we rolled into Hoswich City, it was already seven in the evening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just touched down and as I switched on my phone, a message from Quinn popped up: "I'm waiting for you at the airport exit, ready to take you home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I wanted to bolt from the plane, but inadvertently, my gaze met Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with scrutiny, it was clear he had seen who the message was from and what it contained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was quite miffed, "This kid, he's getting more and more disrespectful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so harsh, he meant well," I instinctively defended Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had bought a ticket for a flight that was scheduled earlier than mine, and by now, he must have been waiting outside the airport for nearly an hour. I couldn't bear to turn him down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott had already seen the message. Knowing his character, he wouldn't let me meet Quinn alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled, "In that case, we really can't let his kindness go to waste. Since Barry hasn't made it to Hoswich city yet, I'll ride with you in his car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was gearing up for another demonstration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Quinn and I haven't clarified our feelings yet, I think it's okay. However, having said what I did to Quinn, pretending to be in love with Elliott in front of him seems a bit cruel to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hail a cab, shall we?" I suggested nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ride with me," Lisa, standing behind us, offered. "My driver's outside, and we've got plenty of room in the van."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been meaning to ask Ms. Fox out for dinner. What do you think, Madeline?" Elliott sought my opinion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," I agreed. I figured more time with Lisa wouldn't hurt, and it would give me a chance to dig a little deeper into who she really is.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot Quinn a message, letting him know a ride was coming for me and he should head back first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, Elliott, Lisa, and I collected our luggage and strolled out through the VIP exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kept his arm around my waist the whole time, or held my hand, his gaze never leaving me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His constant gaze was making me uncomfortable, yet, every time I caught a glimpse of Lisa's crestfallen expression, I couldn't help but feel a smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We hopped into Lisa's business van, zooming all the way into the city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott invited us to the most renowned seafood restaurant downtown, even securing a private room for us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lavish seafood feast was swiftly served up, covering the table in abundance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had a fine bottle of red wine delivered on purpose. Lisa and I sat on either side of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, he was aware of the awkwardness of the situation, so he called over Philip and Alexis.</span></p></div>
