        <h1>Chapter 356 Anti-flu Capsule</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I've transferred my career a few years ago, and I was the founder of Tigress Pharmacy Company. Madeline, what are you doing here? Do you work for Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was also surprised when he saw me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me with a smile after glancing at me from top to bottom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My wedding to Elliott was supposed to be rushed and simple. Moreover, Elliott had been deliberately avoiding my identity after the wedding. Therefore, not many people knew that he and I were married.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tigress Pharmacy Company was not in Hoswich but in Onastin which was about three hundred miles away from Hoswich. So it was reasonable that Marcus didn't know about my relationship with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was so focused on chatting with you that I forgot to introduce him. Marcus, Elliott is my husband." Then I added to Elliott, "Honey, this is Mr. Brown, he just happens to be my friend from high school."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I came back to my senses, hastily took a step back, and stood next to Elliott, introducing them to each other with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed quite indifferent and showed no emotions. However, he had always been like that, especially when it came to work, and he always refrained from showing his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand toward Marcus and said, "Mr. Brown, nice to meet you. If she hadn't told me today, I wouldn't have realized that you and my wife were so close."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's been so many years and I didn't expect it at all. But, Madeline, you got married so early."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus still seemed astonished. At the same time, I could clearly see the regret in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind, it's not too early. Marcus, let's sit down and talk. Are you married now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we were meeting as old friends, we naturally became casual with each other, with less formality of business negotiations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked Marcus with a smile after I gave him a sign to sit down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled slightly, "I had a brief marriage, so I'm currently single."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he even get married and divorced?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Marcus off to join the army back then, we initially wrote through letters. But soon after that, I fell madly in love with Elliott, so my contact with Marcus gradually diminished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I went to college, schoolwork and being in love with Elliott took over my whole life, and Marcus and I just lost touch with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's it. I didn't realize you've been through quite a lot."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what to say for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We can set up a time to talk when we're done with work. For now, we should talk about the work so as not to waste Mr. Bryant's precious time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was a meticulous man. Perhaps he had sensed that Elliott was being improperly ignored by us on the side, so he smiled, "Well, okay, let's get to the point then. Elliott, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reunion of old friends was indeed something to be cheerful about. Therefore, when I turned to Elliott, I also had a bright smile on my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott saw the smile on my face, he was slightly stunned, but he didn't say anything more. Then, he told Marcus blandly, "Alright, Mr. Brown, let's get started. The investment that the Bryant Group has made in the medical field over the years has been mainly focused on medical equipment, and we've been less involved in drug research and development. Why don't you show us your proposal first, so that we can have a general overview first?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. Our sales director, Landen Astley, has brought all the information with him today. Before he shows it, I'll make a brief statement. The drug we're about to put into research and development will be used to fight pandemic viruses, and it's called anti-flu capsule. We've already obtained a patent for it, and the clinical trials have been passed. However, the medicinal materials required for this drug are more expensive and costly to produce, which is why we wanted to seek a large company like the Bryant Group to work together on the development."</span></p></div>
