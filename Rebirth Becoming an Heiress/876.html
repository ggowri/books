        <h1>Chapter 876: Open Confrontation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey's voice was loud, his stature towering. His sudden speech took Laura by surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura let go of my hand, awkwardly saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grey, what are you up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't I be the one asking you that? What are you up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey scoffed and retorted at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I was just planning on introducing Madeline to a few friends. You got a problem with that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura tried to put on a tough front, but in the face of Grey, she still fell a bit short in terms of aura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, your friend, Madeline, doesn't need to be introduced. Besides, today's party is filled with youngsters, and you folks indeed don't share much in common with them. Do you expect us to chat about that grandson of yours who has no blood relation to you? I heard the kid has been sent to an orphanage, is that true?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey said with a hint of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you... Grey Woods, don't you dare cross the line!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so infuriated that she was left speechless for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How am I being unreasonable? Aren't I just stating the facts?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey looked at her with disdain, asking:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't associate yourself with such people. She's all about pleasure and lacks the grace and dignity of a true lady of distinction!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura tugged at my hand, trying to pull me away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with me enjoying life? My husband is happy to support me. Aren't you the same, always seeking pleasure? You sure do love the parties I throw!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it comes to arguing, Laura doesn't stand a chance against Grey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura couldn't find a single word to counter Grey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had to admit, she'd hardly missed a party thrown by the Grey organization all these years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, my birthday is coming up in a few days. I'm throwing a grand party at the Hoswich International Hotel. You'll be the first one on my guest list. I won't invite anyone you dislike. Throwing a party is easy, the real difference lies in whether the people at the party genuinely want to have fun with you, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lisa Fox sauntered over, making no attempt to hide her intentions. She made a beeline for Laura, extending an overt olive branch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words instantly restored Laura's confidence. With pride, Laura declared:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard me, right? This party isn't your gig. I didn't invite you, and I hope you won't show up uninvited."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey let out a sardonic chuckle:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ordinary parties? They don't really pique my interest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't your average party. I'm planning to host my birthday bash and private auction simultaneously. Among the items up for bid is a top-notch gemstone bracelet. I heard your husband has been trying to negotiate with my father for it numerous times, but my father has always been reluctant to sell..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa declared with an air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She risked offending Grey Woods just to curry favor with Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the words "premium gemstone bracelet," Grey's face lit up with keen interest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband has always been deeply affectionate towards her. Undoubtedly, he must have bought this gemstone bracelet because he knew she would love it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa knew this, and that's why she used it to put her down.</span></p></div>
