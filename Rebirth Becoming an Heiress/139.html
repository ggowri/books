        <h1>Chapter 139 First Love</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, how is your friend who worked as a lawyer's assistant doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the car passed by the Bryant Group building, I asked Adam casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said it's going well. Mr. Knight treated him well and gave him a strong sense of career direction, so now he knows what to do. By the way, my friend said he wants to treat you to a meal and thank you properly for the referral," Adam said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My original intention was just to create an obstacle for Elliott and Giselle's relationship, but unexpectedly, I accidentally helped Rowan kickstart his career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that doing good deeds without asking about the future is right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? I thought he didn't need to treat me to a meal. You let him perform well and work hard. By the way, how are he and his girlfriend doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked again without showing any emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They had already made up, but they had another argument because of buying a house. Rowan's family believed that they only needed to buy a well-located two-bedroom apartment, but Giselle insisted on buying at least a four-bedroom apartment. Furthermore, Giselle planned to let her mother and brother move in after they got married. Rowan's parents disagreed, so they argued due to their differences in opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam told me the details, so I knew there was an inside story behind Giselle and Rowan's breakup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Giselle and her boyfriend being at odds over a house at this moment, and just a few years later, she could become Elliott's wife, with endless wealth and numerous properties, makes my heart sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly and said, "Isn't it very simple then? Giselle and Rowan's families can each contribute a portion of the funds and buy a big house together, problem solved, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the problem. Giselle said her family doesn't have money and demanded that Rowan not only meet her demands but also buy a big house in full payment. Rowan's parents thought Giselle was being too unreasonable, so they made Rowan break up with her. But Rowan was already trapped because he really liked her," Adam said again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Giselle? Does Giselle want to separate from him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows and asked with great interest, as if I had heard another version of the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest with you, Madeline..." Adam's voice suddenly became mysterious. "Rowan said he recently saw Giselle getting close to a wealthy man. He saw them together several times, with fancy cars picking her up. And that man seems sophisticated and powerful. I suspect Giselle and Rowan can't continue their relationship, but she is cunning. She never mentioned breaking up with Rowan. Rowan now spends most of his salary on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Hoswich, it was rare to find a man who was wealthy, drove luxury cars, had great charisma, and held power and influence. Besides Elliott, who else could fit these criteria?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott could go a whole week without contacting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he was busy pursuing Giselle this week, so how could he have time to pay attention to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charm of first love is truly endless. Giselle was dating a wealthy businessman while also enjoying her boyfriend... I feel inferior compared to her tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was willing to talk to me about these things, which clearly showed that he had no idea that Elliott was my husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Elliott and I got married was almost a secret, except within the upper class circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a young man like Adam, who had just graduated from college, possibly know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this girl named Giselle was very scheming, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and commented, pretending that I was unaware of all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always felt that she wasn't as innocent as she appeared, but Rowan doesn't think so. He always believed that she was pure and kind. It's hard to say, the onlookers are blind."</span></p></div>
