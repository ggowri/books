        <h1>Chapter 448 Feeling the Pain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could speak, Fiona was already angry. She sneered and retorted,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, a shameless third party, are just carrying Elliott's child. Do you really think you are very important? Every woman can get pregnant, but not every woman can give birth to a healthy baby. Why do you come to the hospital so frequently? Is there something wrong with the baby in your belly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was bold so that she could curse others straightforwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never told her much about me, Elliott, and Giselle, but she should have known the general situation from Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeming to hit in the vitals, Giselle instantly became very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You are a doctor, but you cursed me! Do you believe I will complain about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rolling her eyes, Fiona said coldly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a doctor, I just advise you to do good and less immoral things for your child out of my kindness. Otherwise, I am afraid that your child will finally get the comeuppance. Madeline, let's go. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a little weak. Seeing Fiona speaking for me, I would love to watch the farce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing her scolding, Fiona dragged me away. So, going around Giselle, we walked towards the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the report in my hand. As I expected, she was indeed curious about my inspection report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I passed by her, she took the report out of my hand without me noticing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I exclaimed before turning to glare at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly glanced at the contents of my report. Seeing I was examining my chest, she seemed relieved. Then, she immediately said hypocritically,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I'm not on purpose. Madeline, you have lobular hyperplasia in your breasts, so you have to take it easy. I heard that most breast diseases are caused by too much anger. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hide her inner complacency. Holding the report, she smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you try not to appear in front of her, she will be better. After all, bedbugs have no idea how smelly they are and whether their stink will affect others, just like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly grabbing the report from her hand, Fiona gave her a hard look and pulled me away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Giselle was no match for Fiona in quarreling. She was so angry that she was pop-eyed and couldn't speak for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona dragged me away quickly. Until we almost reached her office, Fiona couldn't help but say,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder why the Bryant family would like this narrow-minded woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help smiling bitterly after hearing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my last life, I judged Giselle based on my subjective emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she suddenly broke into Elliott's life, becoming the unique person in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I knew enough about her background and her details, I was abandoned. At that time, I thought she was like the cold and noble moon hanging in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's love made her a sense of mystery, causing me to think that she was such an enigmatic woman mistakenly. After all, Elliott was deeply attracted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, I got to know Giselle in advance, learning about her background and details. In the process, I realized that she was just a tacky, unscrupulous, ordinary, and cheap woman. She was simply not that attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to give up Elliott, but Giselle had never defeated me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had gradually stopped taking her seriously in this life. Moreover, I would make her feel all the pain I experienced in my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, can you get her inspection report? I want to know her test results. "</span></p></div>
