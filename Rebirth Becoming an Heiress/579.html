        <h1>Chapter 579 Nightmare</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?" I exclaimed in surprise, "But for something as important as this, it's best to discuss it with Uncle Benjamin first. Auntie Grey, you really don't need to worry too much about this incident. Once I'm done with my current commitments in a few days, I'll talk to Uncle Benjamin properly and see if we can reach a collaboration agreement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never do anything underhanded. Since I promised to compensate you, I will definitely follow through. Don't worry, if you want to collaborate, just reach out to me anytime, and I'll help connect. Besides, you're soon going to be a part of our Woods family, no need to be formal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey reassured me, patting my shoulder with a very generous demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Grey, you said it yourself, so make sure to put in a good word for me with Uncle Benjamin. Collaboration is important, but the key is the price. Let Uncle Benjamin see the value in keeping it within the family, offer a lower price." Quinn chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, leave it to me! It's getting late, I won't disturb you further. Rest well, I'll head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey cheerfully agreed, bidding us farewell before leaving the room. However, her words left me feeling somewhat awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are there no other rooms on this ship?" I asked uneasily after Grey had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Quinn and I were just acting. It wasn't appropriate for a man and a woman to be sharing a room like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already asked, all the rooms have been fully booked. There are no spare rooms available at the moment. It's fine, you go ahead and sleep, I can sleep on the couch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pointed to the elegant-looking but small sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the sofa, I couldn't help but think how uncomfortable it would be for Quinn, a tall man, to sleep on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, then continued, "Why don't you go back to the front desk and check if there are any other rooms available?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn chuckled and playfully flickered my nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the rooms here were booked in advance. I rushed over last minute, so how could there be a room for me? Besides, most of the people on this ship at night are women. Even if I were to ask to share a room now, I wouldn't find a suitable one. Why are you so afraid? I'm not a monster. Are you worried I'll eat you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always so straightforward, and his words made me blush instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just feel a bit awkward, that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, no worries, I'm not sleepy either. You go ahead and sleep. If I really get tired, I'll manage on the couch," Quinn reassured me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he settled himself on the sofa, taking out his phone to play games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor seemed completely natural, and any further insistence from me would have seemed overly reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I lay down, feeling aches and fatigue creeping in, which was likely because my physical exertion was not fully recovering yet. My eyelids grew heavy, and before long, I slipped back into slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experience of falling into the water this time was eerily similar to the scene before my previous life ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the shock, as soon as I entered the realm of dreams, I found myself once again plunged into the icy sea, frantically splashing water around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce storm raged on the sea, with waves crashing relentlessly, interspersed with a massive bolt of lightning. In my daze, I saw Elliott and Philip aggressively lunging towards me, forcefully pushing my head underwater. Giselle stood nearby, emitting an extremely sinister and terrifying laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt extremely terrified, as if my whole being was about to float out of my body. My entire body began to convulse uncontrollably. Just then, I heard Quinn calling out to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Madeline, what's wrong? Wake up, wake up..."</span></p></div>
