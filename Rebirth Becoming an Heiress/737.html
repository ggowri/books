        <h1>Chapter 737 Maneuvering</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, they had already started tracking us, we need to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Dehan said they also sent some people to follow us, but they didn't dare to get too close to avoid being discovered by the 731 Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and exchanged a glance with Jane, both of us had a determination to disregard everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Delin called me on the phone and calmly said, "You have your companion continue driving 0.3 miles ahead, then turn left at the next intersection, and keep driving along that road for 1.8 miles. After that, you will see a garbage station. You should place the cash you brought next to that garbage station, and we will be responsible for counting it. If the amount is correct, we will take you to see your friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I put the money there and you take it but don't release Quinn? Send me my friend's video again, I need to make sure he's still alive and that you've taken him to the place you mentioned. We'll give you the money in person and you hand over Quinn to us, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guessed that her ultimate goal was to get money, so I once again presented my demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as I made this request, she immediately shouted angrily into the phone, "What do you mean, Madeline? Are you trying to negotiate with us again? I've told you, if you do as I say, maybe your friend can still be alive, but if you dare to play tricks with me, there's a high chance that your friend will die. Think it over carefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already thought it through!" I shouted into the phone, unable to contain myself. "Ten million dollars is not a small amount! If you want this money, then you must let me confirm that he is still alive, and I must see him appear in front of me. Otherwise, my partner and I will never get out of the car, let alone follow your instructions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since this woman named Delin was not the criminal force that Dalton offended, it means that she simply wanted to extort money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was only after money, then I still had room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! As long as you indeed brought ten million dollars in cash, rest assured, I would definitely let you see him. But if you are playing me or if I find out that you didn't bring enough money at all, then you will bear the consequences yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, when I tested her like that, I discovered that her intention was indeed to get money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we were about to reach her designated destination, I quickly shouted into the phone, "You immediately send the video now</span><span>.</span><span> I must confirm that he is okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used my eyes to signal Jane, and she immediately understood. She didn't stop at the location specified by Delin, but chose to continue driving forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Delin, upon realizing that we were still moving forward, immediately began to angrily shout, "Madeline, what are you doing? Why didn't you stop the car?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that she must have been in the white commercial vehicle behind me, following me.</span></p></div>
