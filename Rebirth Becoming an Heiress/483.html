        <h1>Chapter 483 Taunt</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "He means that he has already been very good to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out that no matter how much he appears to like me, when it comes to actual interests, he will still bare his fangs like a wild beast. Love is far less important to a man than business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh and mocked, "I'm not trying to compete with you. But as for Glory Group, I have my own plans. Besides, as long as you haven't officially signed with Marcus, my ability to partner with him is fair game! Elliott, why are you so resentful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Elliott suddenly placed his hand on my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The business world is vast. If you truly want to build a career, you can easily explore other fields. We are a couple. Is it necessary for us to compete in the same arena?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "couple" seemed like a mockery to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly smiled, "We won't be husband and wife for much longer. From now on, you can see me as a rival or a stranger. Either works for me. In short, when it comes to what I want to do, I will not back down a single step! If you have the ability, then go ahead and try to take it back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I firmly reiterated my stance. Elliott's expression darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were someone else daring to snatch my business partner like this, I would have made them disappear from the entire business world of Hoswich. I've decided not to pursue the incident of Jezebel. I can overlook the losses from Allure not airing, but I was the one who first discussed partnering with Marcus on this medicine. Madeline, are you trying to force me to be at odds with Glory Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he said this, it meant he knew it was me who spread the scandal about Jezebel and prevented Allure from airing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The incident of Jezebel? Losses from Allure not airing? Elliott, I don't understand what you mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head to avoid his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intentionally lifting my chin, he forced me to meet his gaze. Elliott stared into my eyes like a leopard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you say that all of this has nothing to do with you with a clean conscience, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "He knows everything. If I deny it again, I will appear hypocritical." So, I chose to remain silent and not say anything further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my tacit agreement, Elliott continued, "Before, I thought you were playing games with me, wanting to challenge yourself. I could give you that opportunity, but my love for you is not for you to exploit in the business world and cause trouble for me. Emotions and running a business are not related."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott thought he had been generous enough to me. However, his words felt particularly harsh to me. I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh and pushed his hand away forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't paint yourself as so magnanimous. Give me an opportunity? Since I entered Glory Group, every opportunity I've gained has been earned by myself. You don't need to act like everything was handed to me by you! I don't want to hear it! And don't mention love to me. When it comes to interests, you act like you want to devour me! So, put away your false love. I'll say it again. We can divorce at any time. The one with ability will get the chance to work with Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, I shifted to the side of the sofa, trying to maintain a safe distance from him as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly became agitated. Standing up, he roared, "So, you've repeatedly snatched my partnership opportunities because you never really saw me as your husband, did you? Madeline, what am I to you?"</span></p></div>
