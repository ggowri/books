        <h1>Chapter 113 Don't Be Afraid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder did not stop. At this moment, Elliott's phone rang, as if receiving a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so late that his subordinates generally didn't dare to disturb him. Could it be Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, I couldn't help but sneak a glance at his phone and saw Giselle's profile picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought she messed up the thing with the flowers and Elliott would ignore her for a while. However, seeing how quickly Elliott replied to her message, I realized I was too naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was his dream lover, while I was nothing special in Elliott's eyes. I couldn't compare to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I think Elliott might have forgiven her. Otherwise, he wouldn't have replied to her messages so enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, I felt even more depressed. I covered my head with the blanket and turned around, facing away from him. I wished there could be a Milky Way between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move anymore. You're going to fall," Elliott suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hid under the blanket and retorted, "It's okay. So you don't think I'm thirsty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't expect me to say that. After a while, he suddenly hugged me through the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women are really complicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately turned around, lifted the blanket, and found his handsome face very close to mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I approached you, and you were afraid that I coveted you. I kept my distance from you, and you worried that you lacked charm. Are you very complicated?" he said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, his eyes intentionally exuded charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were in bed. In a romantic atmosphere, if we didn't want to do something, we wouldn't be adults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to do my best not to look at his charming face. I said, "I didn't think so. Can we peacefully coexist without interfering with each other tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't persist, he withdrew his hand and burrowed into his own blanket, leaving me with a cold and heartless back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not a big deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but complain about him in my heart. I also turned around, with my back facing him, and stopped talking to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a flash lightning suddenly appeared outside the window. Immediately after, the loud thunder scared me so much that I almost jumped out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was very young, I was scared and therefore afraid of loud noises. Upon hearing this sound, I became helpless and couldn't help but tremble. I was on the verge of crying out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was right beside me, but my stubbornness prevented me from seeking his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only desperately clutch the blanket, telling myself not to be afraid. At the same time, I silently prayed for the thunder to stop. However, instead of stopping, the thunder grew louder and louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so scared that I was on the verge of collapsing, and finally couldn't help but burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when I felt helpless, Elliott finally reached out. He pulled me into his arms. At the same time, he gently stroked my back and whispered softly in my ear, "It's okay. Don't be afraid. I'm here."</span></p></div>
