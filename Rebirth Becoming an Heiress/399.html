        <h1>Chapter 399 Debt Collection</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, not too long ago, I almost got swept up in Elliott's charm. Almost fell for him again, believe it or not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thank goodness Giselle's pregnancy snapped me out of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, my mission is clear: block Giselle's path to the Bryant family. But that baby of hers was tricky territory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't target innocent lives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's your take? Think that kid's Elliott's?" I asked Quinn, testing the waters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn paused for a second, then gave me a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, I thought it was impossible. But seeing her today, so confident about the baby, without a hint of guilt... I'm not so sure anymore. Something fishy's going on. Her sudden pregnancy and the Bryant family's approval? Not adding up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn always had a knack for sensing things, and this time was no different.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Quinn shared his thoughts, it felt like he was echoing my own instincts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave me a comforting pat on the shoulder and said, "Looks like Elliott's putting her to the test as we speak. I'll go check in on them. You stay with your parents. I'll give you the scoop as soon as I know more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn hurried off down the hallway, his sharp suit and confident demeanor echoing Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't shake the thought of him skipping the cocktail party he mentioned earlier to be here. I should've asked if it would cause him any problems.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lady with the short hair outside the hotel, was she his girlfriend?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Quinn been seeing someone new?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was puzzled by the sight, but before I could dwell on it, Mom stepped out of the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mouth still bleeding, her eyes red. It made my heart sank, and I rushed to her side, grabbing her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's Dad? And are you okay, Mom? Should we get you checked?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad had a moment, understood everything I said, but he's resting now. Just a minor skin injury for me. But why didn't you tell me about the big news?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mom's expression turned serious, tinged with concern and disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's not that big a deal. Don't worry," I reassured her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing she meant Giselle's pregnancy, I downplayed it to keep her calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mom wasn't buying it. Her expression turned even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Parents always worry about their kid's marriage, dear. The Bryants think they can push us around? Tomorrow, we'll hit them with a lawsuit, demand our 2 billion dollars back, plus interest!"</span></p></div>
