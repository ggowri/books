        <h1>Chapter 191 Departure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pleasantly surprised subconsciously. "That's great! I heard that there are many delicious foods in Louis City. Let's meet in Louis City, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished talking to Quinn, I happily hung up the phone and couldn't help but spin around in my chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Adam knocked on the door of my office and saw me with a happy expression. He smiled and asked me, "Madeline, are you ready? What's making you so happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing much, I was just thinking about those delicious foods you mentioned in Louis City. Adam, are you ready? We can leave now," I asked as I stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the car is waiting downstairs. Madeline, is this your luggage? Let me carry it for you, let's go downstairs!" Adam immediately helped me with my luggage, and then we left together, taking the elevator down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment our car drove out of the Hoswich highway intersection and headed towards Louis City, my suppressed heart suddenly became bright and cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the winding highway and the dazzling sunlight outside the window, I suddenly had a feeling of breaking free from the quagmire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, along with my present life, I have been trapped in the quagmire that Elliott brought to me for so long that I have forgotten how vast the outside world can be, and that I can also leave him and work and live on my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the quiet carriage, a melodious song started playing at this moment. This scene, combined with the song, was just perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nestled in the seat, listening to the melody, unable to resist humming softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam heard me humming and said with a smile, "Madeline, I didn't know you could sing so well. Once we finish our tasks in Louis City, how about I take you out for some singing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, at that time, I will invite a few young male actors from the crew and we can all relax together," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, no problem. By the way, Rowan has been dealing with a copyright infringement case in Louis City recently. He has been wanting to treat you to a meal to thank you for introducing him to his current job. Alternatively, I can have him treat us tonight and have him meet us, how does that sound?" Adam said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam suddenly mentioned Rowan, which made me slightly startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, I have only seen Rowan twice, once at Nicole's flower shop and once downstairs at the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, we have only crossed paths and never truly got to know each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, he and his girlfriend... Are they broken up now?" I didn't really want to ask, but I couldn't help but blurt it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We haven't officially broken up yet, but it definitely won't last long. Giselle has been entangled with that wealthy businessman. Last time the three of us were drinking, he even blamed Rowan for getting Giselle drunk, and almost ended up hitting Rowan," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was unaware of what he was talking about, but I had already seen it in the video Quinn showed me. He described the situation at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to still not know until now that the wealthy businessman was none other than my husband, Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Giselle would break up with Rowan for that wealthy businessman?" I lazily asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely, that wealthy businessman looked so handsome, tall and imposing. Girls surely like that kind of person. Moreover, how could Giselle easily let go of someone who is so rich?" Adam said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah... Elliott was so handsome, so good, so rich and powerful, women would all like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Adam's answer, I was not the least bit surprised, but rather felt an indescribable sense of melancholy deep within my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively reached out to touch my tightly wrapped neck, and I became even more aware of why I was resisting Elliott so much now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, subconsciously, I just wanted to do my best to protect the version of myself that had been deeply wounded in the past.</span></p></div>
