        <h1>Chapter 261 Conversation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This must be my illusion, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes wide, trying to see more clearly, but perhaps because of the alcohol, my eyes couldn't focus at all. At this moment, Quinn went to the terrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retrieved the cigarette case from his pocket, extracted a slender cigarette, and ignited it with a lighter, facing the night sky and leaving me a desolate figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There seems to be an inexplicable loneliness in this back view.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I staggered forward and asked softly behind him, "Quinn, why haven't I ever met your girlfriend for so long?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't look back but blew out a smoke ring. The light blue smoke curled up in the light, and he said, "I don't have a girlfriend. I've been single for a long time and got used to it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't there any woman who attracts your attention?" I murmured. Feeling dizzy from the alcohol, I couldn't help but lean against the door frame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and smiled playfully at me, "Yes, but the woman I like already has a crush on another man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said this, there was clearly an inexplicable hint. Shocked, I instinctively felt that he seemed to mean something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, on second thought, how could this be possible?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Quinn cared about me very much, from beginning to end, I never felt that he had the slightest interest in me but more of a kind of sympathy from a confidant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What type of girls do you like?" I asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he smiled and said nothing more. He just subconsciously pulled the coat aside and put it on me without any explanation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's cold on the terrace. You drank a lot. The wind will make you drunk. Just wait inside for him to come. I'll finish this cigarette."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gust of wind blew over at this moment, and it was indeed freezing. I shivered, turned around, and fell on the sofa due to the dizziness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potency of red wine proved formidable indeed. Once I fell, my mind momentarily drifted into a haze. Though I yearned to open my eyes, my eyelids weighed heavily. I succumbed to a deep slumber without realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how long it took. Vaguely, I heard someone talking in the box.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to open my eyes, I glimpsed beneath the light a tall figure seated in my previous spot, exchanging clinks of glasses with Quinn using my wine glass. They engaged in conversation, their voices intermittently reaching my ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's cut to the chase, Elliott. What do you think of Madeline?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is my wife. Why do you ask this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really treat her as your wife now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're aware of the test results. And I know that your family has pushed you hard in the past two years. If you don't want to continue the marriage with her, at least be honest with me. I can't bear for Madeline to be hurt in any way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will never divorce."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Madeleine is infertile, how will you explain that to your family?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There will be other ways. You don't need to worry about this matter. If you still consider me as a friend, please stay away from her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were obviously talking about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although my eyelids were very heavy, and I felt listless, the room was so quiet that I could hear everything they said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that learning that I couldn't have babies, Elliott would definitely change his attitude towards me, perhaps even contemplating ending our relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to my surprise, I still felt the same firmness in his tone as before.</span></p></div>
