        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged me so tightly that my head was buried in his broad chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost suffocated from his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Quinn pushed him away and pulled me behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was furious:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't force her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was equally angry, pointing at Quinn's nose:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop guilt-tripping her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes turned red, like two lions fighting for territory, and the tension escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both of you, stop arguing. Noah is still sick. I can't think about this right now. Go home and give me some time to think!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid they would start fighting in my house, so I quickly intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mentioning Noah's illness made them both backdown. Quinn hurriedly asked:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's wrong with Noah? Hasn't he recovered from his last cold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just had a high fever again, but it went down with some physical cooling. It's almost morning. You both should go rest and let me be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to ask them to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryant Group Hospital has pediatricians from abroad. If you're worried, I can take you there for a check-up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott immediately suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to trouble you. The doctor I found for Noah is the best in pediatrics. Madeline, you should rest. I'll take you to see the doctor in the morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't back down either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, do you have to compete with me? Noah is my son!" Elliott snapped again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've compromised so many times, but you never appreciated it. This time, I won't back down!" Quinn glared, making his stance clear once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them about to argue again, I hurriedly tried to mediate:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you two stop fighting? My head hurts. Both of you, just leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, I walked straight to the door and flung it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky outside was starting to lighten, and the rain had stopped. As I opened the door, a gust of wind carrying the scent of earth rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must have looked awful, and they both seemed to notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, they left one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the door, watching them drive away. Only then did I finally breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, I closed the door and collapsed on the living room sofa, falling asleep immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up, a thick blanket had been draped over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes to see my mom sitting across from me, tidying up Noah's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering Noah's high fever last night, I anxiously asked my mom:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, how's Noah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fever's gone and hasn't come back. He's in good spirits today, eating normally. Malina asked the doctor, and they said to just keep an eye on him; there was no need for the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her response put my mind at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. As long as Noah's okay. I'll head to the office now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up, yawning. Seeing it was almost noon, I quickly showered, changed, and drove to the office, thinking about all the work I hadn't finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I walked into the Glory Group entrance, I saw a huge bouquet of roses from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wondering who was so romantic to send such a large bouquet, a staff member ran over, smiling:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, these flowers are for you. Should we move them to your office or send them to your home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would send me such a huge bouquet of roses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, I walked closer and was stunned by the almost person-sized bouquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There must be at least 999 roses, all imported red roses, each looking fresh and elegantly packaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned in and saw a card with a handwritten note:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to make up for all the roses I owe you. I hope it's not too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handwriting was bold and stylish, the kind I used to adore. It was unmistakably Elliott's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe he was doing something so clich&eacute;d and romantic. He used to disdain such gestures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the card and the massive bouquet, I couldn't help but feel a bit touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it to the employee caf&eacute;. Let anyone who likes flowers take them. No need to waste them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly, took the card, and told the receptionist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Ms. Mayers, these were sent specifically for you..." The staff member looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged nonchalantly, "It's fine. Good things are meant to be shared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a single rose from the bouquet and headed back to my office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding an empty vase, I trimmed the rose and placed it on my desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rose had a lovely scent. Even a single rose filled the room with a faint fragrance, lifting my spirits as I worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Adam knocked on my office door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was carrying a fancy lunchbox and grinning:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, someone sent you 999 roses this morning, and now you've got a special lunch. The whole office is envious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who sent it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam handed me the lunchbox. I opened it to find a beautifully arranged meal, with even the fried egg shaped like a heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else could be so thoughtful? It must be Quinn. He said he didn't want to disturb your work, so he left it at the door. Quinn really cares about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam said with a cheeky grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the heartfelt lunch and then at the rose on my desk, I felt a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, do you think Quinn and I are a good match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rested my chin on my hand and asked Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, the fact that you're asking me this means..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam leaned in, his wise eyes gleaming with a mischievous light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It means you don't love Quinn enough. Otherwise, you wouldn't be asking me this. Your heart already knows the answer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam spoke slowly, and his words sent me into deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'll be happy with Quinn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked again, but as soon as the words left my mouth, a new voice in my head whispered: If you're so unsure, why not just stay single? Isn't that better?</span></p></div>
