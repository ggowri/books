        <h1>Chapter 245 Decision</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so silent? What are you really thinking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott furrowed his brow, looking at me intently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my gaze to meet his, unable to hold back my curiosity. "Does Cormac know about his condition?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're keeping it from him. If he finds out, it will only burden him psychologically and potentially accelerate the spread of the cancer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Judging from the awkwardness of my current relationship with Elliott. There is no way I can conceive a child with him within the next two years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, refusing him now will make me appear callous unless I choose to divorce him immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle is still coveting Elliott. If I divorce him, she will surely swoop in to marry him, leading me down a path I have experienced in a previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott has proposed the idea of preparing for a child, I can give it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, I spoke up. "I can agree to preparing for a child. However, we need to set some ground rules. Even if I have a child, I have my own career and life plans. I don't want my plans disrupted because of a child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott visibly relaxed upon hearing my acceptance. "That's fine. I can hire a nanny to handle the household chores."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't insist on me becoming a full-time homemaker, which suited me perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm quite busy at the moment. Can we start after I finish filming this series and return from Louis City?" I asked, giving myself a buffer period.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, no problem. Have some tomato soup to boost your health. Since we're planning for a child, we should approach this scientifically. After dinner, let's consult Doctor Louis in detail on the necessary preparations. We can also take some essential medications to ensure we have a healthy and smart baby next year."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suggested enthusiastically, his eyes filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised, thinking, "Is he really looking forward to having a healthy, smart baby with me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never had such thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he is just considering Cormac's health, and I happen to be his wife, making me the chosen one to bear a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, if having a child with Elliott means closing the possibility of him being with Giselle, I am willing to take the risk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I will turn 28 soon, an age where childbirth is becoming more pressing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to consult Doctor Louis. Have you forgotten that Fiona is a doctor?" I chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed more fitting to ask Fiona, an expert in the field, rather than a less familiar doctor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, I forgot about that. Let's ask Fiona and get all the necessary medications ready in advance," Elliott smiled unconsciously, his tone lightening up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately served me a bowl of tomato soup and continued to fill my plate with food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched him being so attentive and eager to become a father, my tense heart was gradually lightened by his infectious enthusiasm.</span></p></div>
