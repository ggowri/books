        <h1>Chapter 403 Revenge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of unexpected anger swept through me, and words spilled out without forethought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fought with all my strength, using every limb to break free from his hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Elliott showed no signs of releasing me. He pinned me down in the backseat, kissing me fervently despite my resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hands were forcefully held above my head, while his thigh pressed firmly between mine. His breath grew heavy, his tongue relentlessly probing my closed lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, instead of feeling any hint of intimacy, I was overwhelmed with a sense of humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vigorous struggle left my hair disheveled and my back slick with sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Physically and mentally feeble, I couldn't match his strength. I struggled until every ounce of energy drained from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I lay back in defeat, utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grip began to weaken. He released my hands, and one of his slid down my clothing, reaching my chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I tried to push his hand away, but he anticipated my move and bit down hard on my earlobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the only one for me," he whispered suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While those words would have once filled me with joy, now they felt like mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mistook my surrender for compliance, relishing the conquest as he nibbled along my earlobe and captured my lips once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands wandered indiscreetly over my chest, while his breath growing heavier and his eyes filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout, I kept my eyes open, observing every detail of his face and every change in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could even feel his arousal against me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rhythm echoed our past madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his actions ignited a fire within me, activating a primal response I couldn't resist, my rational mind reminded me of the humiliation and degradation I endured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't allow myself to repeatedly succumb to Elliott's indulgence, losing myself as I had in a previous life, where I was devoid of dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, I made a decision. I parted my lips, no longer resisting his fervent advances with his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I complied with him as usual and sensed his satisfaction as his once tense body relaxed, as he was deceived by my outward compliance. He began to ease into a more relaxed state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as he began to relax the most, I suddenly arched my leg and forcefully struck where it would hurt him most.</span></p></div>
