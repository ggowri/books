        <h1>Chapter 799 Serenity Villa</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's just that things have been a bit hectic with the Glory Group lately. Don't overthink it, okay? Make sure you take the medicine Dr. Jones prescribed for you on time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath, forcing myself to patiently explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Truth is, my insomnia doesn't need medication, it needs you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he blurted out another confession, leaving me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry had already given me a heads up. To avoid raising Elliott's suspicions, Dr. Jones had prescribed him a medication under the guise of treating insomnia. In reality, it was a type of drug designed to stimulate the nerves and promote blood circulation. The goal was to see if the medication could potentially dissolve the blood clot in his brain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words, Elliott lowered his lashes slightly, concealing the true emotions in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I could feel it intensely, he's really clinging to me now, hating the idea of being apart from me even for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, I didn't feel the same way. On the contrary, if it wasn't for his treatment, I'd want to stay as far away from him as possible to avoid the constant entanglement between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't respond to his words, simply turned on my heel and left. I got in my car and just like that, I was gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't been on the road long when I saw a call coming in from Quinn:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, were you okay last night? Did Elliott do anything to you? That bastard, I can't believe he showed up, and without my consent, took you away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't sweat it, Quinn. I was fine last night. He didn't lay a finger on me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But you were in such a state last night, where did he take you afterwards? Did he take you to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He took me back to Serenity Villa and gave me a hangover remedy. He didn't take advantage of the situation, nothing happened between us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Quinn visibly exhaled in relief:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good, at least the lad has some conscience. Where did you sleep last night? The guest room?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew why Quinn was asking. He was being cautious, after all, his feelings for me had reached a certain level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confessed honestly, "We shared a bed, but I fell asleep almost immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lying in a bed?" Quinn's voice shot up a few notches, "After last night, are you sure nothing happened? Madeline, I don't want you to lie to me. Even if something did happen, I... I can handle it. But I don't want you to lie to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know me, Quinn. If something happened, I wouldn't deny it. But if it didn't, it simply didn't. However, there's something I need to tell you first&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Quinn's voice suddenly tensed up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott has a clot in his brain, causing some neurological issues, a bit of selective amnesia. His memories are stuck in the time when we were still married, when our relationship was at its best. So, his primary doctor suggested that I go along with his treatment for now, not to agitate his nerves. If the clot were to rupture or shift, it could be life-threatening. So, for the time being, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I filled Quinn in on the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the line, a deathly silence fell. After what felt like an eternity, Quinn finally spoke:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you saying you want to pretend you and Elliott aren't divorced for a while? No way, I don't agree. Where are you? I'm coming over right now."</span></p></div>
