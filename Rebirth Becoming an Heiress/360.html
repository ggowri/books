        <h1>Chapter 360 Encounter</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, I'm here. Otherwise, I would have never known you two were having sex in the office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura said implicitly as she thoughtfully watched Elliott and I misbehaved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now I was gradually coming back to my senses, so I hurriedly got up from Elliott's arms, stood still, and quickly straightened my clothes, pulling my messy hair behind my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I glanced at Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I happened to see her eyes full of grudge and hate out of jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Laura's unexpected visit must have something to do with Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I hope you knock before you come in next time and don't just barge in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said coldly and sternly, displeasure in his tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were messing around in your office during the </span><span>work</span><span>, but you blame me for interrupting you, right? What's wrong</span><span> with you</span><span>? Is it because the Serenity Villa isn't large enough for you or you don't have a bed at the Bryant Villa? Why are you shamelessly doing this in your office? Elliott, you and your wife are so unruly!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura suddenly started accusing us. Her aggressive tone clearly showed her strong dissatisfaction with me, and she was not as </span><span>elegant </span><span>as she used to be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had thought that as long as I was kind to her in this life and maintained a good relationship with her, she would stop treating me with such indignation and contempt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize I was being naive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Giselle was there, Laura would still change. Maybe Elliott would also change in the near future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's our freedom," Elliott yelled in a low voice. He stood up instantly from his chair, his eyes filled with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your freedom? </span><span>But y</span><span>ou can't have children."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura stood with her hands on her hips and glared at Elliott with a hateful look on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though everything she said was an accusation against Elliott, I could hear that she was targeting me completely. Every word she said was strongly sarcastic towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you can go out now. If you don't have anything better to do, don't come to Bryant Group and make trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pointed to the door and told Laura impatiently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't come, how would I have known you were so muddled by now?" Laura was furious and slapped Elliott's arm severely. "You should come home tonight, and your Dad and I have something to tell you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Laura looked at me angrily. Then, she turned around and left angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had been standing in the doorway silently watching us. When she saw Laura leave angrily, she immediately chased after her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two quickly disappeared from our sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's sudden interruption caught Elliott and I off guard. We both still felt awkward until the office became quiet again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, I broke it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going back to the Glory Group to</span><span> do</span><span> my work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I happen to have a meeting right now. I'll have Toby drive you there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pursed his lips and said gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Do we really have to go back to the Bryant Villa together tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just wanted to leave, but after thinking about it, I couldn't help but reluctantly ask him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to know what was worrying me, so he turned and held my shoulders and said seriously, "Don't take my Mom's words to heart. No matter what they say at night, nothing will change."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was afraid that I would worry, so he was comforting me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was an indescribable feeling of apprehension in my heart from the beginning, which was the reason why I had never dared to commit myself fully to the relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no way for me to explicitly tell Elliott how I felt.</span></p></div>
