        <h1>Chapter 168 Feeding Porridge</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden openness clearly caught him off guard, and he looked up into my eyes, saying, "Do you really think so? Are you really that indifferent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded earnestly, "Yeah, if you were to change your mind, I would still chase after you every day, and you would still change your mind. If you don't change your mind, no matter how many opposite sexes surround you, it won't change. I didn't understand before, always thinking that I had to hold onto you, but now I understand, I let you go, and I let myself go too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words, rather than being said to him, are more like words I say to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These are also the words I kept telling myself over and over again in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott probably didn't expect me to say this, and upon hearing that I didn't mind, there was a hint of melancholy in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind about that, I ran around a lot and finally bought this bowl of oatmeal. Give it a try," Elliott changed the subject and opened the lunch box, a fragrant smell of oatmeal wafted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sick people didn't have much desire for meat, but they really couldn't refuse this kind of light oatmeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My taste buds were wide open, and I quickly wanted to take it and eat it myself. However, Elliott insisted on feeding me. There was no way, so I had to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clumsily held the spoon, which really didn't look like the kind of person who often pleases women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spooned the oatmeal into my mouth, one spoonful after another. I ate it slowly, taking small bites. Neither of us said a word, but at that moment, I felt the stillness of time flowing around us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene felt very familiar to me because I had fantasized about it many times in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, whenever I felt like I couldn't hold on in my marriage with Elliott, I would fantasize that maybe one day he would grow old, unable to play anymore, and realize my worth. We would be able to sit together like an old married couple who had been together for many years, supporting each other as we walked through the rest of our lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that this scene, which originally only existed in my imagination, would now appear in my world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't speak because I didn't want to break the precious silence, and Elliott didn't speak either. He focused on the bowl of oatmeal in front of him, as if fulfilling a sacred mission, until he finished feeding me the last sip. Only then did he put down the lunchbox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of us noticed, and we didn't know when it happened, but Quinn was suddenly standing at the door of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough, cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden cough he emitted made both Elliott and me instinctively raise our heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Quinn holding a cellphone in his hand, with the camera pointed at us. Obviously, the scene where Elliott just fed me oatmeal was recorded by him with the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like I came at the wrong time." Quinn said with a smile, walking over and speaking with a smile on their face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had a cold face, with little expression on it: "What are you doing here? How did you know Madeline was in this ward?"</span></p></div>
