        <h1>Chapter 722 Cabin Encounter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was familiar with this scent of perfume. It was the fragrance that Elliott usually used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a person with a sensitive sense of smell, so even the perfume he used was specially made by a French perfume master according to his preferences, and the scent was very unique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does this smell, just like the scent emanating from him, mean that he also took this plane?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's impossible... There shouldn't be such a coincidence, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively felt it was unlikely, but this sudden thought still prompted me to open my eyes and see what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flight attendant was right in front of me, blocking my view of the gentleman sitting next to me. At that moment, I heard his magnetic voice saying, "Alright, I understand. I will pay attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That voice, it was clearly Elliott's voice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I simply found it unbelievable, and instantly widened my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flight attendant left after receiving the other person's permission, and I immediately saw the appearance of the man sitting next to me. Despite the dim lighting in the cabin, the familiar silhouette and familiar style of dress allowed me to instantly identify who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, how did you end up on this plane?" I blurted out instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to my surprise, Elliott appeared so calm. He turned around, glanced at me indifferently, and said in astonishment, "So, it's you, Madeline, the pregnant lady. Let me clarify, I am going to Norch City to attend an entrepreneur summit this time. I had no idea you were on this plane as well. Moreover, Barry had booked this ticket for me half a month ago, so there's no need for you to misunderstand anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that I would misunderstand him as before, he immediately offered an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? How coincidental!" I instinctively felt a bit puzzled, considering his </span><span>previous behavior, I was somewhat skeptical of what he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can show you the chat records between Barry and me," he said, as if he had already anticipated my suspicion. He quickly opened the chat records on his phone and pushed them directly in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the time Barry sent him the flight ticket information, and it was indeed half a month ago, but at that time, I hadn't even decided to come to Norch City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that this time it was just a pure coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at his phone with disappointment. However, I unintentionally discovered that he had actually set the photo of us together when we used to go mountain climbing as the background image for his chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he still miss our past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, I had already deleted all these photos a long time ago. At this very moment, seeing these photos again, I strangely feel a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment, and by then, he had already taken back his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned back in his seat and, seeing that I was not speaking, asked casually, "Are you going to Norch City at this time for that movie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I took my team there for a team-building trip," I answered softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, then be careful on your way, considering your current health condition. And, please, don't go near the border. I hope you pay more attention to what I told you last time," Elliott emphasized to me again, though his tone didn't reveal much emotion.</span></p></div>
