        <h1>Chapter 115 Did Elliott Have Any Issues?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After passing through the gate of the Bryant Villa, the car drove across a large expanse of grass and arrived at the front door of the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper liked playing golf, so he built a golf course near his home. This way, he could invite his friends to play golf with him near his home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura liked planting trees and flowers, so there was a large orchard and garden behind her house. She also kept some animals under the fruit trees to pass the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the sound of the car, Laura and Jasper knew we had arrived. So, they happily came out from inside to greet us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you finally came. I saw the photos of you receiving Dikio's VIP group a few days ago. It was really impressive. You looked beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she saw me, Laura immediately affectionately took my hand, showing unprecedented enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that my performance this time made Laura very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, thank you. I had many shortcomings. This time, Elliott took the lead in the reception, and I just cooperated with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I suffered losses because of my straightforwardness. I couldn't speak sweet words, and I might suddenly offend Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I specifically bought several books to study carefully and change my bad temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, my humility made Laura laugh, and she took my hand, looking me up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline became more sensible. Couples face everything together. Your dad and I went through the same. Come, let's go inside and talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Laura took my hand and kindly led me inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott followed behind us, and I instinctively turned my head to see him smiling and talking with his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura pulled me into the house. I saw many fresh fruits and melons arranged on the coffee table in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I sat down, Laura immediately placed a plate of sliced fruits in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the apple I just picked, it's very sweet. An apple a day keeps the doctor away from me. Eat more. If your health is good, you can consider having a baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elderly people all liked children. Just as I sat down, Laura had already begun crazily hinting that I should have a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the plate of apples and didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mom. You can also have a taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of politeness, I ate an apple. The apple was very sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already eaten a lot. The apple tree in our house has produced many apples. Your dad said that something good will happen to our family soon. Madeline, if there is any good news, you must tell me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura desperately wanted a grandson. Every sentence she uttered was filled with meaning, making me feel like apples were no longer sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't get pregnant by myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat comfortably nearby. Watching him, I decided to shift Laura's attention onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I also hope that something good will happen. However, recently Elliott seems too tired, and I feel like his energy is limited. I cannot get pregnant on my own. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't say much. Afterward, I turned my gaze towards Elliott, pretending to be very distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and immediately gave me a stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was very experienced. I hadn't said a few words and she immediately shouted, "Does Elliott have any problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the living room became awkward. The butler and the servants lowered their heads, pretending they hadn't heard anything, but everyone was very curious.</span></p></div>
