        <h1>Chapter 883: Elliott, The Enigma I Never Truly Knew</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm well aware that Elliott is a looker, with a physique to die for. Even if he wasn't the CEO of Bryant Group, he'd still be a catch. He's the kind of guy that could easily turn heads.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are all the latest limited edition outfits of the season. I've selected a set in black, one in white, and another in orange. Each set has its own unique style. Mr. Bryant, which one do you think would best suit your wife's personality?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager personally came over with a few sets of clothes in hand, grinning at us as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, which set do you prefer?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lowered his gaze to me, asking gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not really one for public displays of affection, but there's something about the pride in Elliott's eyes that gives me an indescribable feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which woman doesn't enjoy being cherished by a man?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to employ all sorts of schemes to coax me. Compared to that, this genuine tenderness is indeed what I once yearned for.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but inwardly admit, he really did find the perfect way to get to me. If it weren't for my rational mind in control, I would indeed be moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me give it a shot."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rose to my feet, clutching my clothes as I headed for the changing room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in the changing room, slipping into a new outfit, when I overheard the store manager chatting with Elliott outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you've never brought a lady companion here before. Our staff always assumed you were a bachelor. Who would've thought, you're already a married man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like I rarely take my wife out. From now on, I need to take my lady out more often."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, word has it you're hitched now. Our staff here at the shop are all heartbroken. Every time you used to come in, it was such a thrill, especially for our star employee, Duffy. Poor thing, she's just gone off to cry her eyes out in private."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager chuckled awkwardly, "Didn't Duffy have dinner with you once before? She even added your contact info. Have you forgotten?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, slipped my mind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are too many girls smitten with Elliott. Elliott has always been quite the charmer, but who would have thought, even in this place, he has admirers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slipped out of the changing room, freshly dressed and silent as a whisper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager immediately halted his conversation with Elliott, shifting his praises onto me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These are undeniably limited-edition athletic wear. The cut and material are a far cry from your average sportswear. They fit like a glove when worn, and there's something particularly unique about these pieces. The fabric is extraordinary. It boasts excellent sweat absorption, ensuring that no matter how much you perspire, you won't be left with any unpleasant odors.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried on all three sets of sportswear. In the end, I chose the white one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott generously swiped his card to pay, and I didn't initially notice the amount. It was only after the cashier announced the price that I realized just how expensive this so-called limited edition clothing was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A tracksuit costs this much?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you look good in it, that's all that matters. If you like it, I can buy out the whole store for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top floor of this mall is filled with international big-name brands. Since we're here, let's take a stroll around. I have a few favorite brands, I'll show you around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott grabbed my hand and led me straight out of the store, taking me all the way up to the rooftop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd never been shopping with him before, I had no idea he was such a fashion guru in private. He loved shopping and was incredibly knowledgeable about clothing brands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we walked, he regaled me with the histories and unique features of various brands. He was incredibly familiar with all the international labels, his knowledge of fashion so vast it left me astounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him, dumbfounded. Slowly, I began to realize that the man before me was an Elliott I had never known.</span></p></div>
