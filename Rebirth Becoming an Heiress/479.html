        <h1>Chapter 479 New Virus</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lay on the couch, his brows furrowed. His breathing was labored, and his expression seemed pained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him in such distress, I felt sorry for him. I went to Marcus' bathroom and fetched a clean towel. After wetting and wringing it out, I placed it on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had brought down the medicine. He entered the kitchen, and soon, a medicinal aroma wafted out, indicating that Marcus had started preparing the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Marcus emerged from the kitchen, asking me with concern, "How is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still running a fever and starting to become delirious. Right now, he's still in a semi-conscious state," I whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Marcus took a thermometer and found that Elliott's temperature had spiked to over 102 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said gravely, "I just consulted my friend in Catage. The patients there are exhibiting symptoms similar to his. They have recurring high fevers that don't subside, and antibiotics aren't working. Many hospitals in Catage are already overwhelmed. I've heard the situation is dire. Some experts suspect it might be a new virus. They are currently exploring effective solutions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He travels frequently. It's highly likely he got infected while on a trip. The doctors at Bryant Hospital are top-notch. If it were just a common cold, given his physical condition, he should have recovered by now," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized the gravity of the situation and advised me, "If it is indeed a new virus, the concern is that it might be as highly contagious as the SARS virus from that year. For safety's sake, Madeline, let's both refrain from going out for the next couple of days, and you shouldn't go home either. He'll stay here for observation for a few days to prevent infecting his parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced the previous life, I understood the dreadfulness of such viruses. However, it was precisely because of that experience that I knew Marcus' company's anti-flu capsule would undoubtedly be the most effective treatment in this new viral outbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, standing by Elliott's side, I didn't feel afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Marcus gratefully and said, "Okay! Let's hope this remedy works for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I hope so too. If this remedy proves effective, it will boost our confidence in producing this medicine in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then headed back to the kitchen to check on the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned on my hand, quietly keeping watch over Elliott. At that moment, a phone ring broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was still in a daze, so I reached into his pocket and retrieved his phone. I saw it was Barry calling, so I answered directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, where have you been? We looked all over the hospital but couldn't find you. The doctor said you haven't recovered from your cold yet and can't leave the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's voice on the other end was filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, Elliott is currently with me. I've arranged for a doctor to treat him. Don't worry," I quickly reassured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was momentarily taken aback upon hearing my voice. Then, he composed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, so Mr. Bryant went to see you? That startled me. Alright, Mrs. Bryant, thank you for taking care of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wary of Laura causing trouble if she found out where Elliott was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I instructed over the phone, "Barry, please don't inform his parents that he's with me for now, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mrs. Bryant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry grasped my intention and promptly hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was about to turn off the screen, I noticed that, at some point, Elliott had changed his screensaver to a picture of me. Previously, his screen had always been business-oriented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo was taken by him when we went hiking together in Louis City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, I stood on a rock, looking back at the camera with a radiant smile. The sun was shining directly over my head. Dressed in sportswear, I appeared bright and sunny, with a happy glow on my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback and couldn't help but stare at that photo for a long time.</span></p></div>
