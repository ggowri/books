        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an outstanding young man, coming from a prominent family and having a handsome figure, so there really was no need for him to make such a great sacrifice for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn and sighed helplessly. Just as I was about to say something, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered the phone and instantly resumed that casual tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are taking Madeline home now, Auntie Nina took Zara back to their country," I heard Carole's voice clearly through the phone receiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara went back to her home country? I will bring Madeline over right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn heard the news and felt somewhat happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly hung up the phone and immediately shook his head at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't go home yet, come with me to my house. My auntie, Nina, has gone back to our country with my cousin, Zara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? It wouldn't be quite appropriate for me to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling a bit troubled. After all, I was pregnant now, and if things continued like this with Quinn, it would really be hard to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Now the Woods family basically knows about you and me dating. If you don't cooperate with me, won't it be difficult for me to explain to them? You see, Carole specifically mentioned bringing you back, which surely also reflects Austin and Lily's intention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled and tried to persuade me as he noticed my hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to say something more, but Quinn abruptly turned the car around. "I know what you're thinking. You just think it's unfair to me, but in reality, you've become my shield, so my parents won't keep pushing me to go on blind dates. Don't worry, I won't force you to accept me, but today you have to come back with me, otherwise I won't be able to explain it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, but Quinn, this was the last time I accompanied you to your house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already said so much, and I didn't know what else to say, but I reiterated my stance. I knew that if we continued this charade, by the time the child was born, the Woods family would truly believe that this child was their own descendant. Everything would become too complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn nodded, his face filled with a smile, and drove quickly, taking me to the villa where his parents lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had just arrived at the door when we heard a burst of lively laughter coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And amidst the laughter, there was a girl's voice that sounded particularly crisp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why hasn't Quinn come back yet? Carole, are you sure you called him? It's been over half an hour already. Why hasn't he come back yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara had been insisting on meeting Quinn since the moment she got off the plane. If I hadn't stopped her from making a phone call, she would have made Quinn pick her up at the airport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She grew up with Quinn. When you first went abroad for those two years, she stayed at my house. Every night, she used to sleep with Quinn. We used to joke about them back then, saying that their relationship was so good, they should just be together when they grow up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That won't do, cousins don't stay together! That would be chaotic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why couldn't we stay together? Quinn and I don't have any blood relation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The courtyard was bustling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And their conversation, Quinn and I heard it crystal clear from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the intuition of a girl, even though I hadn't met Zara yet, I could clearly sense from this conversation that this cousin really liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but look at Quinn with interest.</span></p></div>
