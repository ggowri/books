        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry? Why would he be calling me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly astounded, unable to hold back an exclamation of surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott's assistant? Let's step outside then. You can take the call and find out why he's ringing you. It's about time for visiting hours anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn glanced at his watch, then whispered to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, casting a lingering, heartfelt glance at Noah, who was still peacefully nestled in his incubator. Then, I left the nursery with Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found a quiet spot and dialed Barry back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, who used to dread answering my calls, surprisingly requested to meet me over the phone this time. I sensed that he must have something to say about Elliott, so I agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, Barry came to my hospital room, a bouquet in hand, for a private visit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon our first encounter, I immediately noticed his right hand, encased in plaster, and the bruise marring the corner of his mouth. Clearly, he'd been injured too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, he was still as nervous and reserved as he used to be, hesitating to approach. But in the end, he made his way to my bedside:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs... I mean, Ms. Mayers, it's been a while. Are... are you doing better now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm much better now, but what happened to you? How did you get hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at him, surprise coloring my voice as I asked, then gestured for him to take a seat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a seat across from me, then murmured softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got injured while saving Mr. Bryant in Norch City. He was in his car, rolling down a hillside of several dozen meters. His entire right arm was impaled by a tree branch. In the process of rescuing him, I accidentally got hurt too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry kept his gaze on me, his eyes seemingly harboring a message he wanted to convey but dared not to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott tumbled down the hillside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Elliott head to Norch City for work?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he have tumbled down the hillside, and all by himself at that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the scene I witnessed before I blacked out, and the person who bore a striking resemblance to Elliott, a sudden realization seemed to hit me, sending my heart into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, what did you just say? He tumbled down a hillside? Which hillside? Why was he even up there?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly astounded, my voice involuntarily rising a few notches.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you didn't know? I thought you did. He...he went to save you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's eyes were wide with shock as he looked at me, stuttering out his words. I had guessed right about what he wanted to tell me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Barry say this, my mind went blank. I never, ever imagined that Elliott was seriously injured because he was saving me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, for the life of me, I just couldn't comprehend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott was indeed trying to save me, then why did Quinn tell me, upon my awakening, that it was only Dehan's underlings and him at the scene, with no one else present?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Quinn is deliberately keeping me in the dark?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seems unlikely, because Quinn isn't one to lie. If he found Elliott injured, he would definitely come to his rescue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, lay it all out for me, clear and simple. I want to know how he got hurt for my sake."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I fixed Barry with a serious gaze, eager to know the full story.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry is not one for chit-chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all along, he's been the closest to Elliott, the one who knows Elliott's every move best.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry is pure, incapable of lying, and fiercely loyal to Elliott. This is the first time he's ever spilled so much to me without Elliott's permission.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also my first time learning about Elliott's condition, after our divorce.</span></p></div>
