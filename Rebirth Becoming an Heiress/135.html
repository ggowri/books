        <h1>Chapter 135 An Illusion?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who loves you always notices when you get hurt first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin immediately helped Quinn put me on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought it was Quinn who hurt me, so when Quinn let go of me, Austin immediately grabbed Quinn's collar and loudly asked, "Who are you? What did you do to Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you misunderstood. I accidentally stepped on glass and fell down, and he saved me. He is my friend, his name is Quinn," I quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing me say this, Austin realized that he had misunderstood Quinn. So he quickly released Quinn's collar and apologized, saying, "I'm sorry, I see that my daughter got hurt, so I was too anxious. I apologize, Mr. Woods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright, you are eager for your beloved daughter, so I can understand it. Since I have already sent Madeline back home, I will go back first. I hope you take good care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of his elders, Quinn was still very well-mannered and polite. He stood up and smiled as he said to Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed getting late, so Quinn did not stay for long. After saying goodbye to us, he left my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually told a lie and didn't tell my parents about everything that happened at night because I didn't want them to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was very worried when he saw my foot wrapped in a big bandage. He helped me apply the medicine again and put on a new gauze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he said he would carry me upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am already this big now. The last time Austin carried me was when I was very little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is old now, so I simply can't bear to let him carry me on his back. However, he is afraid that my movement might cause the wound to burst and bleed, so he insists on carrying me upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on Austin's shoulder, watching him struggle to carry me up the stairs, step by step. His hair had turned gray. This man, who once stood tall in my life, had clearly aged a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering the past, I felt extremely guilty in my heart as I recalled how I had hurt his heart repeatedly and defied him due to my stubbornness in the previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I had the opportunity to live again, so I could make up for him and Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, I lay in bed tossing and turning for a long time without falling asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At midnight, I still had my eyes open. I opened WhatsApp and casually clicked on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, I saw Elliott, who never posts on Instagram, actually posted an Instagram post, and it was just ten minutes ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent a picture, which was a whole sky full of stars, with a dim sky and no moon. From the visual angle, he should be standing on the top floor of Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not accompany any words, but the pictures alone made people feel a sense of inexplicable loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the picture for a long time, and just then, I saw Giselle commenting on his Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle: Elliott, haven't you slept yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was curious if he would reply to Giselle, so after a while, I refreshed Instagram again. Sure enough, he replied: "Nope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle replied to him again, "Go to bed early. Thank you for helping me out today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not reply to her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle's statement carried a tremendous amount of information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a faint feeling that she seemed to want to let me know through Instagram comments that she and Elliott were getting close. Moreover, Elliott had helped her more than once, and even today he came to her rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was increasingly feeling that Giselle seemed to be not simple, but at the same time, I was also thinking, "Could all of this be my preconceived illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Giselle intentionally making secret advances towards Elliott at this moment?"</span></p></div>
