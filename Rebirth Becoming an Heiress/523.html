        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the fever subsided, Quinn's spirits noticeably lifted. I brought him a bowl of cereal, which he devoured in one go and demanded more. So, I fetched him another bowl of cereal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I summoned David, who took Quinn's temperature and conducted further examinations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When David received the test results, he was taken aback. He had initially been skeptical about the anti-flu capsule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe it. Just this one medicine actually managed to bring down Mr. Woods' fever and even cleared up the inflammation in his body. This..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David probably didn't anticipate such a significant effect from the medicine. He was momentarily speechless, visibly stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Dr. Thomas. I'll be frank with you. I'm pregnant, and I've been through the wringer with this virus before. But thanks to this medicine, I found relief and eventually recovered. And once I bounced back, my body developed immunity to this virus. Just look at me. I've&nbsp;been hanging around here for days and not a sniffle. If the medicine didn't work so remarkably, I wouldn't feel half as sure of myself," I said with a smile, finally feeling relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David immediately gave a thumbs up. After this time, David obviously no longer had any doubts. He immediately asked me, "Ms. Mayers, where did you buy this medicine? I immediately suggested to Dr. Muller to quickly introduce this medicine. This is simply good news for patients with this viral cold..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This medicine is produced by Tigress Pharmacy Company, in which I've invested. There's a batch in my subordinate's cars, and I can donate it to the hospital. You can use it for the treatment of critically ill patients first. If there are significant effects, we can discuss further cooperation," I informed David.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David was overjoyed and rushed to report to Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Oliver found me, and he immediately dispatched personnel to our vehicle to retrieve the five hundred boxes of medicine we had allocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this incident, Oliver had a complete change of heart towards me. From his initial arrogance and skepticism, he turned to gratitude. When he heard about my generous donation of masks and protective gear, his gratitude swelled even more, and he immediately asked for my contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Quinn's fever subsided, he visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few days of rest, his injuries started to improve, and he was gradually able to get out of bed and walk around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spent these days in Quinn's ward, attentively taking care of him. His needing to use the bathroom went from being extremely awkward at first to becoming routine for both of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of urine hitting the toilet became a familiar melody, and Quinn, increasingly naturally, allowed me to assist him in going to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come over and help me, I need to pee again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his personality of never being satisfied even when benefiting, Quinn often teased me after his fever subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can walk perfectly fine now. Go by yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave Quinn an exasperated look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, my stomach still hurts, and I don't have the strength to undo my belt. Hurry, help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly much better, yet he pretended to be weak, which made me want to throw a pillow at him in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stomachache and no strength, huh? You don't need to bother Madeline. Come on, I'll help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to give in to Quinn's feigned helplessness and assist him, Carole suddenly pushed open the door to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending these few days together, we became more familiar with each other. Carole, who knew Quinn better than anyone else, walked in with a mischievous grin aimed at him.</span></p></div>
