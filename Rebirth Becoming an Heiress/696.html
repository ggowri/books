        <h1>Chapter 696 He's Everywhere</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him appear, my instinctive reaction was to wonder if he had been following me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, from his surprised gaze, I felt as though it wasn't. If it was a pursuit, his gaze wouldn't be so surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was also stunned for a moment, and at that moment, he had already taken long strides and walked toward me and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already ordered the food at this moment. He closed the menu and looked at me with a smile. Due to facing away from the entrance, he was still unaware that Elliott had already entered the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at?" Marcus asked me in surprise, and at the same time, he suddenly reached out and touched my face. "What did you sneakily eat in the afternoon? It's still on your face, like a greedy little cat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action was somewhat intimate, and people who didn't know would think he was flirting with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled awkwardly, about to say something, but I noticed that Elliott suddenly stopped in his tracks. His face turned cold, and he directly sat down diagonally across from Marcus and me, less than 7 feet away. Moreover, his seat was directly facing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is to say, every move I made next was seen by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately felt uncomfortable and a little uneasy in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott did not greet me and, after sitting down, he immediately looked at the menu. It seemed that he had no intention of looking at me, which left me unsure of what to do or how to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, how about we switch seats?" I didn't want every move of mine to be under Elliott's gaze, so I suggested to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but it seems like all the seats are taken." Marcus nodded and immediately stood </span><span>up to look around. To his surprise, the business of this shop was unexpectedly good. Just a moment ago, it was empty with only a few people, and now it was suddenly full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was looking down at the menu, while Marcus just glanced and didn't notice Elliott's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down again and asked me somewhat puzzledly, "Isn't this seat good? It's by the window, and there's even a fountain view next to it. Don't you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't dislike it, but well, since it's already full, I won't change anymore." I shook my head and had no choice but to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calculating the days, there are about three months left, and you will be giving birth soon. Time flies, and you shouldn't overexert yourself recently. If possible, delegate the company matters to someone else," Marcus kindly advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I haven't personally taken care of many things now, but there are still some things that I have to keep an eye on myself to feel at ease. By the way, Marcus, did you go to the border when you went to Norch City this time?" I thought of the movie that Dalton invested in, so I asked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked me, puzzled, "What's up? Why are you suddenly asking about that?" I replied, "I heard it's quite chaotic over there now. I heard there was just a shootout recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a director who made a patriotic film about the border, and I want to invest, so I want to know more about it. What do you think? Does this kind of theme sell well?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you talking about Dalton?" Marcus unexpectedly realized and directly mentioned Dalton's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? How do you know Dalton? Do you know him?" I was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I know him, he is my comrade. We met when I went to Norch City this time. He is currently in need of funding. His film has some risks and there is a possibility that it won't pass the censorship. Even if it does pass, the chances of it being a box office hit are not high. Several potential investors who had initially agreed to cooperate suddenly terminated the partnership. He is currently troubled by this. I originally wanted to ask you for help, but I thought the risk was too great, in case it would burden you..." he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that Dalton was Marcus's comrade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world, it was really too small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's great! Then please help me make an appointment with him, and tell him that I have an intention to invest and would like to have a detailed discussion with him," I said.</span></p></div>
