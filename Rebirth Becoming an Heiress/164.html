        <h1>Chapter 164 Lying</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that she was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really didn't like Elliott, she would never say things like there is a big gap between them and it's impossible for them to be together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She subconsciously defended herself like this, proving that she must have thought so in her subconscious mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further confirmed his own judgment, and he couldn't help but feel fortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't preemptively performed her script a few times, Elliott might have already fallen for her by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else did you guys talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to casually ask, hoping to gather more information from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and whispered, "He didn't say anything else. Elliott just said that he feels sorry for me. He said that I lost my father when I was young and had to rely on myself, unlike you. He also said that he wouldcompensate me twice as much in the future, and I can directly tell him what I need. But for now, I don't need anything. Madeline, as long as you and Elliott are happy, that's all that matters. If there's nothing else, then I'll leave first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle finished speaking and then stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a different meaning in her words, her hidden thoughts were like thorns, piercing into my heart, causing my heart to ache as if it had been torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These are obviously words that Elliott would say, and she deliberately let me know, perhaps also deliberately wanting to make me sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she deliberately boasted with such an innocent tone, and I found it difficult to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they both haven't made me aware of anything happening between them now, so I shouldn't argue with a little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the seemingly delicate girl in front of me, but every word and every expression seemed as if they had been carefully rehearsed. I understood even more why I had lost to her in my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truly formidable enemy never boasts loudly, but rather, like her, hides in the shadows and strikes with precision when you least expect it, like a snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then you go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, sure. Madeline, take good care of yourself. I'll come to see you another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle nodded and then turned around, walking out of my hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had just left when Elliott hurried back from the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a silver-gray suit. As soon as he entered the room, I could smell that familiar hint of light perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this fragrance, overlapping with the lingering scent of Giselle's perfume in the air, I was instantly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Giselle was in the ward just now, I couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity with the scent of her perfume. At this moment, I remembered that the scent of her perfume was surprisingly similar to the fragrance Elliott often used in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott give her perfume?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt confused, and Elliott clearly had no idea what I was thinking. Seeing me sitting on the hospital bed in a daze, he immediately approached and flicked my forehead with his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "What are you thinking about that you're so fascinated?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just come over and meet Giselle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott paused for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I arrived at the door, she was standing there waiting for the bus, so I had Toby take her back. What did you all talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, probably thinking that my face was a bit pale. He felt a little sorry for me and gently rubbed my lower lip with the pad of his thumb. His actions were particularly gentle, and his eyes were full of compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really looked like the image of what a good husband should be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should have been moved, but why is it that I didn't feel anything in my heart, instead, I felt an unusually deep sadness?</span></p></div>
