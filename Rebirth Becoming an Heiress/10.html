        <h1>Chapter 10 Sharing a Room</h1>
        <div><p>Quinn was on the phone.</p><p>His words were so shocking that I jumped up.</p><p>&quot;Quinn, why do you have Paige&#x27;s phone? What did you do to her, you jerk?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you calm down and listen?&quot; Quinn interrupted. &quot;She got drunk in our VIP room last night. Some rich guys from Hoswich started hitting on them. I sensed trouble and had them stay in rooms upstairs. Paige left her phone there, and I picked it up when you called.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quinn, did you really help her? You didn&#x27;t do anything to her?&quot;</p><p>I was haunted by what happened to Paige before, so I was worried.</p><p>&quot;Of course not. Don&#x27;t believe me? Add me on WhatsApp. I have video proof,&quot; Quinn said, giving me his number.</p><p>In my past life, Quinn and I were enemies and didn&#x27;t contact each other, so I didn&#x27;t have his WhatsApp.</p><p>Still skeptical, I added him. He quickly sent a video.</p><p>It showed female staff leading Paige and Fiona into separate rooms, with no men around.</p><p>It looked like Quinn was telling the truth.</p><p>&quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll trust you this time, Quinn. But if you lie, you&#x27;re done,&quot; I said, feeling a mix of relief and doubt about his integrity.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not as bad as you think, Madeline. But now you owe me. I saved your drunk friend from trouble,&quot; Quinn replied.</p><p>&quot;Owe you? You know them too. It was the right thing to do. I&#x27;m hanging up!&quot;</p><p>Though glad my friend was okay, I wasn&#x27;t thankful. I ended the call without further chat.</p><p>As we drove, I stared at Toby&#x27;s back, deep in thought, memories of my past life swirling in my head. </p><p>Then, a crucial bit of forgotten information hit me.</p><p>I suddenly asked Toby, &quot;You have a sister, right?&quot;</p><p>I&#x27;d always seen Toby just as a driver and never chatted with him. </p><p>Surprised, he respectfully responded, &quot;Yes, Mrs. Bryant, I have a half-sister who just graduated.&quot;</p><p>That&#x27;s right. It was her...</p><p>Suddenly, I remembered from my past life how Toby, working as Elliott&#x27;s driver, was connected to Giselle, his half-sister. </p><p>Giselle&#x27;s affair with Elliott was partly Toby&#x27;s doing. </p><p>Little did Toby know, this connection would soon boost his career, landing him a deputy general manager position for a major project thanks to Elliott.</p><p>What a twist of fate!</p><p>This jogged my memory, and I took the chance to dig deeper by striking up a conversation with Toby. </p><p>He mentioned Giselle&#x27;s mom owned a nearby flower shop where Giselle helped out after work.</p><p>That reminded me of something. </p><p>Elliott, who wasn&#x27;t into flowers, suddenly had fresh lilies in his office daily and various flowers at home. </p><p>I realized Giselle must have used those flower deliveries to get closer to Elliott, building trust and admiration.</p><p>It clicked how those small moments could spark a romance.</p><p>I squinted, silently praising my clever realization. </p><p>If only I had been this perceptive in my past life, maybe things wouldn’t have ended so tragically.</p><p>As I was lost in thought, Toby had parked the car at Serenity Villa.</p><p>&quot;Mrs. Bryant, we&#x27;re here. Good night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>I got out of the car, reluctantly entering the house since it was too late to bother my parents. </p><p>Everything inside was as I left it, my skincare products and clothes all in order.</p><p>Feeling tired from the drinks, I soaked in a milk bath, washed my hair, then slipped into a robe and stepped out.</p><p>Just as I was about to crash, I heard a noise at the door, and then in walked Elliott. </p><p><em>Wasn&#x27;t he supposed to be at the hospital with Sylvia after her suicide attempt? Why was he back already? And he never used to come into this room, always the one next door.</em></p><p>Surprised, I blurted out, &quot;Back already? How&#x27;s your sweetheart?&quot;</p><p>I couldn&#x27;t resist a jab as I tightened my robe. </p><p>He shrugged off my sarcasm, saying coolly, &quot;None of your business. Go to sleep.&quot;</p><p>Then he headed for the bathroom. He usually avoided this bathroom because of his cleanliness obsession, but tonight he ignored it and barged in, not even bothering to shut the door. </p><p>I blocked him, saying, &quot;Wrong room, your bathroom&#x27;s next door.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is my house; I&#x27;ll shower where I want.&quot;</p><p>Ignoring his usual quirks, he pushed past me and walked into the bathroom.</p><p>Soon, the sound of water splashing filled the bathroom...</p><p><em>Oh hell... Elliott was actually showering in my bathroom?</em></p><p>Rubbing my eyes, I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing.</p></div>
