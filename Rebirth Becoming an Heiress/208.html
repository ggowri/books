        <h1>Chapter 208 Sweet Moments</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately woke up, but I dared not to open my eyes. I felt clearly that Elliott was kissing me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed me very gently, earnest, and reverently, just like the prince kissing Sleeping Beauty. I didn't open my eyes so as not to disturb him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many women could keep indifferent when they were treated so tenderly by men?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted that Elliott broke down my barriers again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lust surged and rolled through my body, making my heart beat fast. The uncontrollable feeling of wanting to have more pushed me to hug him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I had taken the initiative since I was born again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My reaction encouraged Elliott. In an instant, his kiss became intense, like the drizzle suddenly turned into a rainstorm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned over me and kissed me intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only wore a set of thin, long-sleeved pajamas. Elliott quickly took off my pajamas and then took off his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment we touched, we could no longer control ourselves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Elliott had restrained himself for too long, and he couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, I had to remind him with a flushed face, "Elliott, I... I'm on my period."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, Elliott stopped as if someone had pressed the pause button on him. He remained silent for a while and finally couldn't help but reveal his displeasure with a curse word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I heard him say dirty words, and I could imagine how irritated he was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What day are you on?" Elliott lay next to me, panted slightly, and asked me in a low voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is the third day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to upset him, but I could do nothing. I really didn't know he would come to Louis&nbsp;City today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that we were destined not to be a real couple... I was happy, but at the same time, I felt a little pity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you climb the mountain with me tomorrow? Will this be inconvenient for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott didn't blame me. Instead, he was worried about whether I could go to climb the mountain with him tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh... He had such a considerate side. It was so surprising.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be fine. Tomorrow is the fourth day, and my period is almost over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already let him down tonight, and I couldn't ruin his plan of climbing the mountain tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm going to take a shower."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Elliott got out of bed and went straight to the bathroom. Soon, I heard the shower from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't had sex before, but Paige had told me many things about it, so I knew that Elliott felt terrible after being interrupted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humph... He deserved it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had ignored me in the past, but today, he had to endure the&nbsp;terrible feeling silently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering that in my previous life, I had tried all kinds of means to seduce Elliott in order to have a child, but he gave me no response. I finally felt the pleasure of revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paige said, a man would not cherish the person who loved him but would desperately want to get the person he couldn't be with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, I gradually calmed down. When Elliott came back, I had put on my pajamas and lay on the bed. I looked at him and smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little mischievous darling."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled helplessly, got into bed, and pulled me into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not my fault. You didn't tell me you would come today," I said smugly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed my nose lovingly, saying, "I will own you one day..."</span></p></div>
