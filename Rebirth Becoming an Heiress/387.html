        <h1>Chapter 387 Playing the Weak Card</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant's a total sweetheart. But gotta admit, I'm a bit on edge. Allure still hasn't sealed the deal with Netflix. And with Do Not Love wrapping up soon, if it's not locked in, who knows what could happen?" Jezebel chimed in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, that familiar, magnetic voice echoed in the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amy mentioned we've been in talks with their big shots. Unless something crazy happens, we'll probably be sealing the deal in a few days. Let's chat later, got something else to handle. Later!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was calm as he wrapped up, and his footsteps echoed out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard he was making moves, I quickly slipped into the neighboring empty ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott strolled past without giving me a second glance, totally focused on whatever was ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his footsteps faded into the distance, I was about to split when Giselle and Jezebel walking out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Man, lying in bed all day really takes it outta you. Finally up and about!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stretched lazily in the hallway. She looked so carefree, no one would think she was supposed to be resting up for a baby. Talk about surprising.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fly under the radar, I quickly turned to the side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Jezebel piped up, "You're not doing much in front of Mr. Bryant. What's your game plan? Gotta say, you've got me feeling a bit uneasy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's laughter followed as she said, "Oh, come on. How else am I supposed to get Elliott to pamper me? And this baby bump didn't come easy. Can't just let it go to waste, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel chuckled. "True that, Giselle. With your body, playing the weak card seems a bit off. Still got doubts, though? Do Not Love's killing it in the ratings, that bitch Audrey must be on cloud nine. But if Allure doesn't make waves after airing, it could all go downhill, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but furrow my brow a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle faking stomach pains was a real curveball.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What threw me even more was Jezebel calling Audrey a bitch. That was not something she'd say lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemed like there was some beef between them. Definitely something Adam should dig into.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't sweat it. Allure's got Bryant Group backing it up and a bunch of seasoned actors in its corner. No need to fret over small fries like Do Not Love. And honestly, I don't even give Madeline a second thought. She's clueless about movies and TV, doesn't know squat about the market. Their success this time? Pure luck. But if things tank, we can always negotiate. Getting Netflix on board soon will put our minds at ease, right?" Giselle chimed in again.</span></p></div>
