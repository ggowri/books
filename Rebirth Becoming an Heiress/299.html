        <h1>Chapter 299 Message</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade quickly winked at Tom. They were probably a little impatient, so they quickly said goodbye quietly and left the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, I was afraid Lily would be too worried, so I specially asked Fiona to take Lily to take a rest in her office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, to thank the three of them for their help, I invited them to a restaurant near the hospital for a casual meal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Austin's current situation, I had no appetite. I asked them to order some of their favorite dishes. Then, we sat down around a table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw that I was depressed all the time, so he patted me on the shoulder and said, "Madeline, you must be stronger. Your family still need your support. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Don't worry. The doctors here are capable and have rich experience in this field. Your father will be fine," Fiona said comfortingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Fiona comforting Madeline, Paige also echoed, "That's right. Your dad has been exercising and is strong now. He will be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, thank you very much for today! But I am still confused right now," I said with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone will react like this if something like this happens to him. You can stay at my house these days. My house is nearby. It's convenient for you to take care of your dad," said Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'll just stay in the hospital, and my mother also needs me to accompany her," I shook my head and refused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that I felt uncomfortable, so they didn't know what to say for a moment. Everyone had a worried look on their face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Quinn said again, "Elliott, don't worry. I will explain it to him. He may have forgotten how indifferent he was to you in the past, so you became accustomed to not asking him to help."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn always understood my thoughts. It was true that I cared about Elliott over the past many years, but I had become accustomed to not asking him for help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but his reaction today showed that he was quite concerned about this matter. But I can understand his feelings after thinking about it," Paige said with his chin in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you need to understand him? A person who had been indifferent to Madeline is now demanding Madeline rely on him. Doesn't he know that everything has to change slowly?" Fiona said with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quinn smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is also a good thing. At least it shows that he starts to care about Madeline's thoughts, instead of being as indifferent as before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and Paige heard this and agreed in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them speculated Elliott's thoughts made me helplessly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, I suddenly received Laura's message,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you back to Louis City? I want to see you. Are you available now? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time she sent a message to force me to divorce Elliott, but I didn't reply. After that, there was contact between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what her purpose was in wanting to see me at this time. However, I was not afraid and didn't want to escape, so I reply her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Let's meet in Lantern Cafe an hour later, okay? "</span></p></div>
