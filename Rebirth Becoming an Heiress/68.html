        <h1>Chapter 68 You Have Changed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was almost completely paralyzed. Quinn practically dragged me to the outside of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he dragged me into his car, all my emotions surged. I couldn't hold back anymore and burst into tears in the backseat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly handed me a tissue. Afterward, he started the car and we flew away from the hospital. He sped all the way, taking me to the seaside of Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, was I very disheveled today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back on the seat in the back compartment. I felt cold all over my body. I had a sense of exhaustion, as if I had just released all my pent-up emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. You were very brave today. You should have done this a long time ago, firmly saying goodbye to those who didn't care about you. You should be true to yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned his head to look at me. His face was filled with genuine appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, every time I used to see him in the past, I always found him annoying. But at this moment, I suddenly realized that he was actually quite adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was I acting like a crazy person just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I think about the scene where I just let loose in the hospital, I can't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. I thought you were like a female warrior just now. In the whole of Hoswich, who dares to talk to Elliott like that except for you? Honestly, I wouldn't dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed. He revealed his flawless, white teeth. The aura he emitted was as warm as the sunshine after the rain, making people feel warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that he was doing his best to comfort me and warm me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would you be afraid? You have challenged Elliott more than once recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was amused by him for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I had disliked him for a long time. He treated a girl who loved him like this. Don't worry, someone like him will definitely get what he deserves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn spoke again. And his tone even made me start to doubt if he had been replaced by someone else. I also began to question whether he was truly Elliott's good friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Quinn was always firmly on Elliott's side. He also intentionally mocked me, sarcastically, making me feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he become so good in this life? How did he become so loyal to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't figure it out. So, I couldn't help but look at him with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you didn't used to see me like this before. How come I feel like you've really changed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw me smile and finally breathed a sigh of relief. He opened the car door and got out. Immediately, he opened the backseat door and gestured for me to get out and take a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I wasn't familiar with you before. So, I never saw things from your perspective. Back then, I simply thought, as a girl, how could you stoop so low to please a man? I am a person who despises evil, so I don't really like weak individuals. Honestly, I used to look down on you. If I were in your shoes, I would have moved on a long time ago. Why do you have to lower yourself like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We walked along the embankment while he was speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Quinn told me these heartfelt words. And when I heard them, I wasn't surprised. Because I knew that these were indeed his genuine thoughts in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about now? How come you suddenly changed your attitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because recently I noticed that you have changed. You are no longer the same as before, putting all your thoughts on Elliott. You are also not as weak as before. Before, you were so weak that you didn't dare to fight for anything for yourself. Actually, whether it's strength or charisma, Sylvia and Giselle cannot compare to you. I admire the way you now pick up your own trump card and challenge Elliott. Truly, this kind of girl is charming. Madeline, remember my words, don't lose yourself for any man. Only when you love yourself will others love you. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted my shoulder. He said earnestly.</span></p></div>
