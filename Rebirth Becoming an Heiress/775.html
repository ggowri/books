        <h1>Chapter 775: Awakening</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived at the Bryant family's place in no time, bringing along a few patches of medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had someone prepare the medicine as per Marcus's instructions. In front of Jack and me, Marcus administered the medicine to Elliott, and then, he began to give him injections.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire acupuncture process, Marcus was completely engrossed. Jack and I stood off to the side, not daring to make a sound, for fear of interrupting Marcus's treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was drenched in sweat, his expression alternating between tension and relief. Finally, under his intricate needlework, we saw a few drops of blood, darker than ink, drip from Elliott's finger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a sigh of relief escaped Marcus, his face finally breaking into a smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luckily, they only messed around a bit. With some detox medication and the special treatment, it can be resolved. I'll be back. Once these bruises are cleared, Mr. Bryant should be waking up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words indirectly confirmed mine and Jack's suspicions about the woman. A look of relief washed over Jack's face:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, then it's fantastic! I was wondering why Mr. Bryant hadn't woken up yet. Turns out, someone's been messing around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew, good thing it was just a minor trick. Otherwise, even with my medical skills, it would've been tough to handle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a laugh, his face visibly easing up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next few days, I didn't go anywhere, not even home. I stayed glued to Elliott's side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, my favorite thing was to watch Elliott lying quietly beside me, going nowhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the sickbed, the face I once knew so well was mature and handsome, its skin a sickly pale. His eyebrows and neatly arranged eyelashes framed a pair of unusually elongated eyes. His originally sharp features had softened considerably due to his prolonged bed rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I once loved him. Every time I gazed at him, resting my cheek on my hand, I thought he was the epitome of beauty. No matter how much I looked at him, it never seemed enough. And the more I looked, the more I loved him, the more I felt I could never let go in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I no longer love him now, I have to admit, staring at his face for too long, those long-lost hormones that once fluttered in the depths of my heart, still have a kind of urge to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, could you quit playing the Sleeping Beauty? Do you really think you're that handsome? Let me tell you, looking at your face right now, I don't find it attractive at all. I'm even questioning my taste back then. What's so great about you? I used to like you so much, but now, the more I think about it, the less I understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guarding a sick person, worry as you might, the boredom is simply unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but start to rant about him. After all, he was just lying there motionless, and I figured, no matter how much I ranted, it wouldn't hurt his pride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, the sickly man lying lifelessly on the hospital bed twitched his eyelids, followed by a slight movement of his lips. Before I could even react, his eyes snapped open, glaring at me with a face full of anger.</span></p></div>
