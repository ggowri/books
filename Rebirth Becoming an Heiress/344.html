        <h1>Chapter 344 He Is Hiding Something</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Katrina suspiciously. "Katrina, doesn't my dad know about this situation? Have you reported it to him? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The finance department reports data in every meeting. But the Glory Group has made great progress in recent years. Jade has exaggeratedly praised every project, so everyone is very optimistic about the current situation. Austin always believes what Jade says. So we don't have much right to make decisions," Katrina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top priority now is to reorient the position of the Glory Group by cutting off less-making projects in a timely manner and finding ways to increase profits. In addition, judging from the current economic situation, we are not suitable for diversified development. We should also give up those business areas that we are not good at as soon as possible," I said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, except for our main machinery business, we also have businesses in medical, real estate, automobile, film and television, finance, and other fields. How can we make choices among these?" Hearing what I said, Issac felt confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me think about it. When I have an idea, I will call all of you to have a meeting together," I said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my mind, I already began to recall everything from my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, a major event occurred at the end of this year. A new type of influenza virus broke out in large areas. This virus was first prevalent abroad and then transmitted to other countries, causing most domestic people infected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medical care was obviously the top priority for our next development. So this area must not be given up. On the contrary, I should take precautions to increase investment in this field.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the virus began to spread, real estate and automobiles had been deeply affected by the sluggish domestic economy and it would not be very prosperous in the next few years. These two areas were not the main businesses of the Glory Group. However existing projects could be retained. As for those less-making projects, we could just completely axe them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the financial industry, this area was the one that Jade insisted on. This industry wasn't what the Glory Group excelled in, and most of the income had been embezzled by Jade. So this field should also be axed, especially in the current unstable situation. We must take action quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I was reminiscing, I recorded all the important points in my notebook one by one. I also made a plan for how the Glory Group would develop in the future. After all these works, I had a basic idea in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac and Katrina had left my office. But Adam still remained here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline. Do Not Love has received a high rating after its release. The response on the Internet was also very good. But the Bryant Group's Allure will be released shortly. They make great progress in it. The previous news I got was that they would not film it anymore, but recently I heard that they have completed the project. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Allure will be released too? When did they start filming? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was immediately puzzled. After all, I never heard Elliott talk about this issue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the reason why he bought the copyright of this drama was to help Sylvia gain popularity, but he broke up with Sylvia. So how could this drama suddenly be filmed and get ready for release?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we were shooting Louis City, they were also shooting their film in Haanlaywood. But the Bryant Group did a good job in confidential work, so no one got this news. It wasn't until recently that this news was leaked out. Now the publicity of their drama in the early stage almost surpasses that of ours, and many of the actors they hired are veteran ones. So I worry about the popularity of Do Not Love..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Adam sent all the information he had collected to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned by Allure's early lineup and the actress they chose. The star they chose was Jezebel.</span></p></div>
