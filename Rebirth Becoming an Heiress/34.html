        <h1>Chapter 34 He Apologizes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had been waiting when I arrived at the hospital. After checking my condition, she immediately arranged for me to get a drip and transferred me to a single patient room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the drip, the drug effect in my body gradually wore off, and I gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them guarded me by my bed, feeling a bit sad about what happened tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott is a bastard. He left Madeline alone on the mountain road in the middle of the night! I've never heard of such a heartless husband before. What a bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige remained angry, clenching her fists tightly, wishing she could beat up Elliott right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were those two people arranged by Elliott? If he was cruel like that, he could go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona also gritted her teeth and couldn't help but speak up for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It couldn't be him. Elliott will never do something so ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shook his head and firmly denied Fiona's speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But who else would have known that Madeline was alone on the mountain road in the middle of the night? That person clearly had been targeting Madeline for a while, and that's why they knew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona began to analyze everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you offended anyone recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige turned her head and looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, I already had an answer about who plotted against me, but the conflict between me and my family had just begun. I didn't want my friends to know about this now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I shook my head, I clearly saw a hint of doubt in Quinn's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have just wanted to say something, but when he saw me shaking my head, he didn't say anything but just gently patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't been so lucky, your reputation would be completely ruined tomorrow. But don't worry. I will punish those two people severely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why didn't I notice how nice you were before? Madeline used to say that you were a jerk just like Elliott. Why did you suddenly change?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had heard a lot about me and Quinn, so she was surprised by Quinn's change and couldn't help but joke about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's past is past. People change, you know. I have realized that Madeline isn't as difficult to get along with as I imagined..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn felt a little embarrassed and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, outside the ward, a deep voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this voice, I instinctively felt a bit nervous. I subconsciously looked up and saw Elliott standing at the door of the ward. He was still wearing the dark suit he had on in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to him, I almost fell into the hands of the bad guys, yet he had the audacity to show up. I got angry when I saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw him and immediately rushed over to question him loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you bastard! You left Madeline on the mountain road in the middle of the night. Do you know what she went through?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you may not care about Madeline, but you cannot put her in danger. She is your wife! If anything had happened to Madeline tonight, we would definitely not let you off the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona couldn't help but speak up for me, and the two of them criticized Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood still in place. His face was calm. He couldn't allow anyone to criticize him before, but this time, facing the attacks from Paige and Fiona, he didn't retort at all. Moreover, he apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that was my fault."</span></p></div>
