        <h1>Chapter 810: His Sudden Appearance</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is someone tailing us?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this car is heading in the same direction as us, isn't it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I came up with a plan. Spotting a rest area up ahead, I steered the car into it, parking neatly in one of the available spots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, let's get out of the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nudged the sleeping Adam, signaling him to get out of the car with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since that incident in Norch City, I've been on high alert every time I return to this place, constantly wary of any potential mishaps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even though Jade and her crew were reined in by the military last time, there might still be others keeping a close eye on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam caught my wary look and instantly realized something was off. Without missing a beat, he joined me in exiting the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had we stepped out of the car, than I spotted the black sedan trailing behind us into the service area. What's more, it smoothly slid into a vacant spot not far behind us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam caught me staring at the car, he asked me with a puzzled look:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's up? Something going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, that car has been tailing us for a while now. Let's hang back here and see. I'm curious about who exactly is in that vehicle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I whispered to Adam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam gave a nod. He pulled out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it up, then he started to saunter, deliberately heading towards the direction of the black sedan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a smart one. He feigned a simple trip to the corner store for a bottle of water. But in reality, as he passed the front of that car, he made it a point to sneak a peek inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made a quick trip to the restroom and then I was back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was standing by the car, waiting for me. As soon as he saw me return, he promptly handed me a bottle of mineral water:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, hop in first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed the bottled water and hopped into the car, immediately questioning him, "Did you get a good look? Who's in there?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam nodded, "There are three men in black suits sitting inside, all of them look pretty burly. But due to the tinted windows, I can't make out their faces."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three burly men?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart instantly leaped into my throat. Instinctively, I dialed Quinn, briefing him on the situation and our current location.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I thought, just in case something happened to us, he could promptly get his friends in Norch City to lend a hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, after hearing what I had to say, he just burst into laughter:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret. Those three individuals were specifically assigned by me to covertly guard you. I didn't tell you because I feared you might think I'm overreacting."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why... why didn't you tell me sooner? You had me on pins and needles this whole time!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, I instantly felt a wave of relief wash over me. Simultaneously, I was deeply moved, my heart swelling with emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, he's truly wonderful. He always puts me first, silently giving his all for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We're hitting the road soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At dusk, we rolled up to the base where Marcus and Jane were stationed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've leased a large plot of land at the foot of a mountain in Edulet City, using it as a base for their medicinal herb cultivation. They've also specifically built a quaint three-story white building to serve as their company's office and a place to hang their hats.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little white building housed numerous rooms. By the time we arrived, they had already prepared two rooms for our stay. The interior decor was identical to that of a typical budget hotel, impeccably clean.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Jane have been here for a while now. It's clear to see, they've developed quite the seamless partnership.</span></p></div>
