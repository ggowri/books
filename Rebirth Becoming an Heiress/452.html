        <h1>Chapter 452 Annual Banquet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, who was sitting beside Giselle, made her hair in a vintage style and was wearing a dark red dress, precious neckline, ring, and bracelet with diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Laura specially brought Giselle here, otherwise, she would not have been able to get a ticket for this annual banquet with her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that before I officially divorced Elliott, Laura had already taken Giselle to attend the annual banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I deliberately took a few steps closer, standing behind the pillars to listen to their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, you haven't attended the annual banquet for several years, right? I feel like I haven't seen you for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, since Bryant Group was handed over to my son, Jasper and I have retired and enjoyed life. We happened to be in Hoswich recently, so we wanted to have some fun here and meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, who is this girl next to you? I don't think I've seen her before. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, this is Elliott's wife Giselle. Giselle, let me introduce to you, this is Ms. London from Miracle Group, this is Ms. Lee from Jason Group and this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Laura wanted to bring Giselle into the circle of noble ladies, so she was introduced the background of each noble lady enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Elliott and I had been married for more than three years, except for our wedding day, Elliott rarely took me to such occasions, and I had little interaction with these rich ladies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they were not familiar with me. Laura's introduction easily made them mistake Giselle as Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there and curled my lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura especially attended this annual banquet tonight to prepare for the child in Giselle's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Giselle to attend such an occasion so that she could announce the child's identity in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They met Giselle first, and because they were unfamiliar with me, they must have thought that Giselle was Elliott's wife. In this way, if Elliott and I divorced in the future, Giselle would naturally become a member of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura made a great plan, but it was a pity that I happened to be here tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I endure the Bryant family silently replacing me with Giselle and erasing my existence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, what a coincidence. You never attended this annual banquet before, why are you interested in it today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Laura was about to let everyone focus on Giselle, I walked directly towards her, held Laura's hand affectionately in front of all the ladies, and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden appearance made Laura stunned. The moment I held her arm, I felt like she was about to jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she couldn't hide her surprised expression and exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, who is this lady? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wealthy lady in the crowd immediately raised a question. Everyone instantly focused on me and Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Giselle, who was smiling happily just now, looked gloomy now.</span></p></div>
