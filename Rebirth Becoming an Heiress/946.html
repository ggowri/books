        <h1>Chapter 946 A Match of Strengths</h1>
        <div><p class="MsoNormal">The meal soon began.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This meal was organized by Lisa after all, so she acted more enthusiastically than any time before.</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, she stood up and initiated a toast, and then, she introduced each of them individually.</p><p class="MsoNormal">From her introduction, I could hear that each of them was an expert in the field of medicine in China, and they all came from different parts of the country.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The fact that these experts gave up their busy careers to go to the same dinner shows that they all gave face to Lisa, or rather, to her father.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa seemed to be intent on emphasizing her family&#x27;s appeal in the field of medicine, so she not only introduced Elliott to every expert in the room, but also toasted a glass of wine to each of them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She was a really good drinker and a strong woman in front of this group of men, unlike the cool image she conveyed to me earlier.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I could sense that she was showing herself, and at the same time, she was constantly watching Elliott&#x27;s reaction to her.</p><p class="MsoNormal">With my understanding of Elliott, I actually know that more than a beautiful woman, Elliott has always longed for a woman who can move forward with him in his career, and this is the reason why he is so eager to get back together with me now, but loathed me in the past.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After all, in his last life, Giselle also played many roles in his career, making him trust Giselle extraordinarily.</p><p class="MsoNormal">And, once a man has achieved success in his career, he does need to have a woman by his side to take care of some of his affairs, and to handle some of them externally together.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lisa must have seen through this, so she was eager to show off her abilities in every aspect to prove that she was not just a vase fit for viewing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I sat quietly by Elliott&#x27;s side and watched her quietly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">After she had introduced everyone, not realizing it was my turn, she made no mention of the Glory Group behind me, but simply said:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;This is Ms. Mayers.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">She was then ready to skim over it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since I had come to this occasion, there was naturally no way I would let go of this opportunity to make more connections, so immediately after her introduction, I was ready to take the initiative to open my mouth and express myself.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I was just about to make a sound, when Elliott, who had been silent all this time, suddenly opened his mouth slowly:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Ms. Mayers is the president of the Glory Group, when the nationally renowned capsule was developed by their shareholding, Ms. Mayers has always been very interested in investing in the pharmaceutical field, and is currently preparing to vigorously expand the business in this area.&quot;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Without me having to speak up to defend my dignity, Elliott made the introduction for me straight away.</p><p class="MsoNormal">At the time when the flu was raging across the country, the capsule that Marcus and I had co-developed together was indeed renowned across the country, and surely everyone here was aware of the drug.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hearing Elliott say that, a very surprised look spread across these people&#x27;s faces.</p><p class="MsoNormal">They originally thought that I was the female companion that Elliott had brought along, and knowing that I was the president of the Glory Group Group, in an instant, everyone complimented me.</p></div>
