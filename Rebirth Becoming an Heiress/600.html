        <h1>Chapter 600 She Knew</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt it impossible as they clearly got off the car one after the other and walked towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was starting to doubt my own eyes when suddenly Jezebel's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the screen, her expression instantly brightening, and swiftly headed towards the hospital entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jezebel stepped through the hospital doors, I distinctly heard her shout into the phone, "Philip..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left only the lingering scent of her strong perfume in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, with one arm around each of us, smiled and said, "The annoying one has left. Ladies, would I have the honor of treating you to lunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did she just call out 'Philip' on the phone? Or did I mishear?" Paige asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had caught the name Jezebel shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must have misheard. Neither of us heard it. Madeline, did you catch that?" Quinn said, winking at me as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood Quinn's intention. He didn't want Paige to know about the relationship between Philip and Jezebel, fearing it might affect the baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I nodded in agreement and said, "I didn't hear it either, Paige. Maybe you misheard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps I did. Quinn, who did you come with just now? I thought I saw Philip behind you, but now he's nowhere to be seen," Paige replied, her tone filled with doubt. Apparently, she had saw Philip before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, he got off the car and realized he was out of cigarettes, so he went to buy some. We came here specifically to pick you up. Philip is becoming more attentive to you," Quinn explained, trying to cover for Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as I watched Paige bask in her happiness, for some reason, I felt a pang of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn led us to the car. As we got into the car, we saw Philip sitting in the front seat, his baseball cap pulled low over his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip! Why didn't you get off the car? We almost got into a fight with a woman, and you didn't come to protect me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, just settling into the back seat, noticed Philip in the front and angrily punched his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip winced in pain, then quickly turned around with a smile, trying to appease her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were arguing. I just needed to use the restroom. If I knew someone was bothering you, I would've come to help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Men sure know how to lie convincingly. If I didn't know about the things Philip did behind Paige's back, I might have felt happy for her hearing him speak like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I just felt disgusted. Knowing Philip betrayed my best friend, I had to endure it for the sake of Paige's unborn child. The suffocation was worse than running a high fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rolled down the window to cool off the anger burning inside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn soon pulled up at a nearby restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all walked in together, ordered some of the restaurant's specialties, and sat facing each other in pairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was in the late stages of pregnancy now. Shortly after sitting down, she hurried off to the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she left, I saw Philip take out his phone and quickly start typing a message.</span></p></div>
