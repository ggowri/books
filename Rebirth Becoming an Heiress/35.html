        <h1>Chapter 35 Compromise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was. You went too far. Don't take advantage of your family's influence to bully a woman like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is too much. Elliott, if you ever treat Madeline like this again, we will have to force her to divorce you no matter what she thinks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My two friends became even more emotional when they saw Elliott give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Elliott came over, he must have realized that he was wrong. Why don't we leave them alone for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn made a suggestion slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona glanced at each other and then looked at me, waiting for me to decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I actually had nothing to talk about with Elliott. Being left on the mountain road by him tonight made me very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent. Unexpectedly, Elliott spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bring night snacks for her. Leave us alone. I have something to say to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott raised the takeout box in his hand. Only then did I notice that he had brought something with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm also hungry. Let's go eat something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said casually. He shook his head, gesturing for Paige and Fiona to leave the ward with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, take a rest. If you feel uncomfortable, feel free to call me. I'll be nearby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was still a little worried about me and repeatedly reminded me. Then, they left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott closed the door of the ward and walked towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the takeout box and a delicious smell hit my nose. I was very familiar with this smell. It was the sandwich from a restaurant that I really liked. That restaurant was not far from Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my memory served me right, this was the first time Elliott had bought me night snacks. Moreover, he knew what I liked, which was beyond my expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat some. It must have been a tough tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke in a calm tone, and it was impossible to tell whether he felt guilty or not. He handed me the sandwich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I actually didn't have much appetite. When I saw him and remembered how he left me alone on the mountain road, I still felt angry. So, I turned my head away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm good. I'm not hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect such a thing to happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw that I wouldn't eat it, so he put the sandwich aside. His flat tone sounded like he was justifying himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like you care. I never really meant much to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I said this, my heart still ached. Perhaps this was the aftermath of being hurt too many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can let you do that script."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally compromised, sounding like he was using that script to redeem himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ridiculous. I had already signed the contract for that drama. His opinion didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look at him but just snorted coldly. Then, I turned my head away, not wanting to look at him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he reached out and forcefully pulled my body towards him, forcing me to turn my head and meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought about it. Actually, things should have been easier between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked into my eyes, and surprisingly, there was a hint of sincerity in his gaze. Was he trying to shake hands and make peace with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were like black holes with mysterious power. When we locked eyes, my heart skipped a beat.</span></p></div>
