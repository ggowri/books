        <h1>Chapter 627 Photos of the Child</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey also sneered, "Is that so? But I heard that your grandson is a test-tube baby. He was born prematurely and is still living in an incubator. I wonder if that's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was too busy showing off her grandson and didn't mention these things. Obviously, she was deliberately concealing and didn't want everyone to know about these bad things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura did not expect Grey to openly talk about these things in public. For a moment, Laura's face turned pale, but she still pretended to be calm and said, "Those are nonsense! My grandson is just a few days away from full term, so he is temporarily placed in an incubator for observation. In a few days, he will be alright and you will see him by then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura pretended like this, I couldn't help but say, "Is that so? Ms. Campbell, if that's the case, why don't you show us your grandson's photo?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately said this in order to embarrass her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Fiona had already sent me photos and videos of the kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the photos and videos, that child appeared to be very different from other babies. Not only did he have wide-set eyes, but his mouth was also protruding. When he opened his eyes, he had a vacant expression. And most importantly, he looked nothing like Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had seen that child before. Otherwise, with her show-off personality, if the child was cute, she would have already taken out photos to show off everywhere. Laura must have thought that the child's appearance was not good-looking, so she hid it from everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said that, Laura's face instantly became extremely embarrassed. She felt a bit guilty and rolled her eyes at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were no longer a part of my family, you have no right to judge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately burst into laughter without saying a word, and Laura's old friends' curiosity was already piqued by me. They all chimed in, "Yeah, Mrs. Bryant, do you have any pictures of your grandson? Let us see who he looks like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, her son was so handsome, so her grandson must be good-looking too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, hurry up and show us the photos, let us have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone started to make a fuss, which made Laura very embarrassed. After a while, she reluctantly said, "I didn't take any pictures. Newborn babies are all wrinkled and not yet good-looking. If you are curious, you will see him at the baby's birthday party. By then, the baby will have recovered and will definitely look good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura struggled to find an excuse. However, how could I possibly give up this great opportunity to embarrass her in front of everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I immediately laughed out loud and said, "What a coincidence! I happen to have a photo of her grandson on my phone. Are you sure you want to see it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just finished speaking when Grey instantly understood what I was going to do. She immediately agreed, "Really? Then of course I want to see. The Bryant family has such a big joy of having a grandson, there's nothing to hide. Now everything is so well-nourished, the baby just born is very good-looking. Moreover, the Bryant family has such good genes, how could the baby not look good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned on my phone and found the child photos that I had saved long ago, and brought them in front of Grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey initially had a smile on her face, but when she saw that child, her face instantly filled with astonishment. She immediately covered her mouth and exclaimed, "Oh my goodness, why does this child look like this?"</span></p></div>
