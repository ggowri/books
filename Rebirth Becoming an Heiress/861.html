        <h1>Chapter 861: The Unexpected Apology</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott eyed my casual attire, a slight frown creasing his forehead as he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you in sportswear today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the weekend, isn't it? I find sportswear quite comfy. Don't you?" I asked, already knowing the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I adore, adore you. No matter what you wear, I simply adore it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott Bryant, who used to dictate what I wore and what jewelry I adorned, now doesn't dare to voice a single opinion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hopped into the car, and he quickly followed suit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver whisked us off in no time, heading straight for the Bryant Villa, a place I hadn't set foot in for several years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott led me out of the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, who never used to greet us at the door, was surprisingly waiting for us there today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing us, Laura immediately came over, greeting us with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're finally back. Your dad and I have been prepping lunch since morning. If you'd been any later, the food would've gone cold."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was genuinely thrilled to see Elliott, but her gaze kept dodging mine, as if she was afraid to meet my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was clueless as to why she suddenly invited Elliott and me over for dinner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I rarely pay mind to their thoughts. Whatever her intentions may be, I simply don't care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, did you and dad prepare today's lunch?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was taken aback as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's not often you and Madeline come home. Your dad and I definitely have to show off our culinary skills! Madeline, come on in, make yourself at home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Laura mustered up the courage to face me. She looked at me, her face beaming with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attitude was a stark contrast to yesterday's. I was on the verge of calling her out, but considering Elliott's condition, I held back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who doesn't know how to act?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wants to play a part, I'll play along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? After all these years of marriage with Elliott, I've always been the one serving you guys, never tasted a meal made by you. Today, I'm definitely going to savor it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I teased her with a grin. And just like that, we strolled into the living room together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was already seated at the dining table, waiting for us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he always wore a stern expression whenever he saw me. But today, he surprisingly flashed a rare smile and even took the initiative to greet me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline's here, grab a seat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attitude, it really takes me by surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because of Laura's drama yesterday?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did they suddenly become so friendly towards me overnight?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I murmured a thank you. Despite mentally preparing myself to play along with their charade, the sight of the couple and the all-too-familiar layout of the living room brought back a flood of unpleasant memories. So, I couldn't bring myself to utter the words "Mom and Dad".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't overcome the deep-seated aversion within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The spread today is truly lavish. Mom, it's just the four of us for dinner, why go all out like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pulled me into a seat, facing a spread of sumptuous dishes. He couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today's meal, your dad and I prepared it especially for Madeline. On reflection, we haven't done the best job in the past, we owe Madeline an apology..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, who used to love bossing me around from across the table, surprisingly sat next to me today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she grabbed my hand, speaking with utmost sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This took me by surprise. I was stunned, the shock clearly etched on my face...</span></p></div>
