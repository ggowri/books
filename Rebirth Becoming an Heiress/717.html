        <h1>Chapter 717 Refusal</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at him calmly, through the car window, and I could feel the eager anticipation in his eyes. He stood still, with his hands outstretched toward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have thought that if he confessed his feelings to me like this, I would definitely throw myself into his arms, let go of all past grievances, and start over with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just waved my hand at him and called out lightly, "Elliott, I'm leaving, please move aside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were visibly dimmed for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled strongly, as if it had been struck severely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My reaction probably completely caught him off guard, so he was momentarily confused. He instinctively took two steps back, and then turned around again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he still couldn't accept reality. He walked up to my car window and forcefully knocked on it twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and looked at him calmly. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just said those things to you, and you... have such an attitude toward me?" Elliott's eyes were filled with intense anger, as if he had never felt so ignored before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of attitude should I have then? Elliott, I am really busy and I don't have the mood to talk about these lovey-dovey things." I looked at him, my tone still calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I believe this sentence sounds familiar to him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because in the past, whenever I wanted to express my inner feelings to him, he would always use this sentence to shut me up, which hurt my heart so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harm he felt today was actually relatively mild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to be more indifferent, more rigid, and more ruthless toward me than I am toward him today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already considered very kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, had a proud man like Elliott ever experienced such contempt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline! Is this how you're going to treat me? Are you punishing me for my previous heartlessness toward you?" He finally couldn't hold back his composure, and angrily shouted at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained calm, with no hint of emotion in my voice, "You misunderstood. I didn't mean that, I am genuinely busy. If you don't believe me, I can show you my schedule. I have only 20 minutes until my next meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not deceive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since taking over Glory Group completely, my time has become increasingly tight and insufficient. There are too many things to deploy and coordinate and too many people to negotiate with... In a certain sense, I suddenly understand his previous busyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppose, back then he might not have just been perfunctory with me, he was genuinely busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, I was just a useless little woman who spent all day at home waiting for him to pity me. I couldn't understand, I always thought he was just making excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, people can truly understand and empathize with each other only when they stand at the same level and height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The present me, I really don't hate him that much anymore, and I understand that there were reasons why he didn't love me before... So, there's really no so-called punishment, it's just that I truly don't care anymore, that's all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have changed now, completely changed as a person. Madeline, you..." Elliott looked at me, his eyes filled with pain and helplessness. He reached out to touch my face, but his hand only hovered in the air before he weakly let it drop. "Forget it, just go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally stepped aside, and I, too, did not hesitate at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately stepped on the accelerator and roared past Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, through the rearview mirror, I saw his figure standing there empty and lonely, resembling a deserted man.</span></p></div>
