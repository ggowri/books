It's not that easy to be a bag boy and a tour guide, women are a pain in the ass to go out, if you regret it, it's not too late.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was still on her pedestal as she said with a straight face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's okay, I can.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said as he lowered his head and tapped his phone a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few moments, a text message sounded from his phone and he looked up, addressing the three of us:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Why don't you guys check out of the hotel you booked before, I've booked you into the top of the line suite at the hotel I'm staying at, the suite has several separate rooms so that you can stay together without being disturbed by each other, and you'll have a special personal butler to attend to you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Are you talking about that top of the line hotel in Seoul? Rooms there are expensive, wouldn't a suite be ridiculously expensive?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's eyes widened in surprise, amazed at how rich Elliott was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So what if it's expensive, are we the ones who don't deserve it?

I don't need a top suite, I'll just have the same suite as you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson saw this and he hurriedly asked Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Get your ass back to school and sleep in your dormitory, I haven't </span><span>talked</span><span> to you yet for what you did in school.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott faced Orson with a completely different attitude, he immediately put on his parental demeanor and said to Orson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson flattened his mouth with an aggrieved look:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, you don't value your brother! How can you be like this?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Cut the crap.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, why don't I be your driver tomorrow? I'll do all the tiring work for you, how's that?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You go back to school and cut the crap!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott scowled, he was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson looked at Elliott, he didn't want to go, yet he didn't seem to dare disobey Elliott, he stood up obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, why don't you let Orson come with us tomorrow, I don't mind having an extra bag carrier.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige suddenly spoke up for Orson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson was instantly happy:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yes, Elliott, you serve your sister</span><span>-</span><span>in</span><span>-</span><span>law and I'll serve the other two sisters, we'll each do our own work, and that way I'll be able to take some of the work off of you too, won't I?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave him a look, probably thinking that his words made sense, so he said nothing more, as a sort of acquiescence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all got a little hungry in the next few moments, and each ate the food on the table in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, we followed Elliott back to the same hotel he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had booked a room directly for the three of us, which saved me the embarrassment of having to be alone with him, and made me secretly relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, we held the line and didn't cross it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, Fiona and I went to the suite he booked, when we entered the door, we found that the suite is particularly large, moreover, the decoration style is extraordinarily luxurious and noble, at first glance, it is from the big designers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige squealed in amazement as she picked out one of the rooms and ran in, yelling and screaming, and jumped right on the bed:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh my god, this bed is so high class, I've seen it on a luxury website, the price of this bed is a million dollars, not including the mattress!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Paige, you're rich, can you stop looking like you've never seen it before?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona couldn't help but shake her head as she couldn't help but spit at Paige, however, in the next second, she suddenly let out a surprised yell:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh my god, there's actually that 'Desire' by that most famous Korean painter, KING, in this room! Oh my god, is this for real? Can't it be? Such an expensive painting, aren't they afraid of other guests breaking it?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona immediately ran towards that painting, she stood beside it in awe, she didn't dare to touch it with her hands at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two people </span><span>......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at their exaggerated appearance, suddenly helpless, I stood still, quietly looking around this room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously this suite is more advanced and luxurious than Elliott's room, however, my heart is a bit empty, and even my body, it seem</span><span>s</span><span> to be emptied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I thought of everything that happened in Elliott's room, my thoughts drifted a little, and my body went a little soft </span><span>......</span></p></div>
