        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden scene scared the hell out of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I saw Elliott hit the ground, I immediately dropped to my knees, frantically tugging at his clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I... I was drunk, I didn't mean to. I genuinely thought he was faking it..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, a somewhat sobered Quinn clumsily crouched down beside me, stuttering out an explanation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! Now, get Barry over here, pronto! And rush Elliott to the nearest hospital!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could see something was off with Elliott, so I quickly yelled out in alarm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that it hit Quinn. He quickly sprang to his feet, bolting towards the door while calling out Barry's name loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The nearest hospital is about 30 kilometers from here. Mrs. Bryant, please step aside. Let me check on Elliott first. I have some basic medical knowledge."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane crouched down at this moment. First, she flipped Elliott's eyelids upwards, then she felt his breath. After that, she started pressing against Elliott's chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Barry had already rushed in, all flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott collapsed on the ground, Barry frantically pulled out a bottle of medicine from his bag and thrust it into my hands. He was so nervous, he was stuttering:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, use... use this. Dr. Jones instructed that if Mr. Bryant ever falls into a coma, he should take this medicine as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Barry's words, I quickly instructed Jane to halt her actions and immediately fetch a bowl of water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, we pried open Elliott's mouth and shoved the pill in, following it up with a swig of water. We watched as he swallowed it down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, given his condition, does he need to go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Elliott swallow the pill, my frantic nerves finally settled. Then, I found myself asking again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got off the phone with Dr. Jones. He said as long as Elliott's breathing is steady, he should just lay low and rest. Take his meds. No need for a hospital visit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry chimed in again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We're on the outskirts of Edulet City, a place remote and unfamiliar to us. Despite Dr. Jones' reassurances, I can't help but feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if something unexpected happens to Elliott in the middle of the night? What would be the best course of action then?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after discussing with Barry and Jane, we decided to drive Elliott to the hospital together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was already three sheets to the wind at this point, but when he heard us talking about heading to the hospital, he insisted on tagging along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after some persuasion on my part, he finally retreated to his room for some rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry fired up the car, taking me, Jane, and Elliott on a ride to the nearby hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was familiar with the surroundings. Under her guidance, we quickly drove to the hospital, checked into the emergency room, and briefed the doctor on Elliott's condition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is nothing more than a small hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the dead of night, and the hospital was running on a skeleton crew. Upon hearing the situation, the doctor simply arranged for an available room, suggesting that Elliott stay for observation for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, unconscious in the hospital, was somehow more reassuring than at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us maneuvered Elliott into the vacant hospital room. Afterward, I had Barry take Jane home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, those two drunkards in the Little White Building needed someone to look after them at night. I felt more at ease once Jane returned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone in the hospital room, I found myself sighing softly as I watched Elliott lying still on the sickbed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I was in for a peaceful night's sleep, but little did I know, a series of unexpected events were about to unfold.</span></p></div>
