        <h1>Chapter 641 Emotions Out of Control</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pool, male prostitutes, and the two women's shameless revelry in the video frightened Laura. She was so scared that she couldn't utter a word, staring blankly at the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video, which had lasted for several seconds, came to an end. Once again, the scene fell into a deadly silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host was experienced yet still at a loss now. He didn't know how to salvage the situation in the face of such an epic and shocking scene. The host stood there with a gaping mouth, clutching the microphone, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel manager rushed in, in a state of panic, wanting to find technicians to handle the situation. However, Quinn had already briefed the personnel beforehand, and Ken's technical skills were far beyond an ordinary hotel technician.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no matter how anxious they were, they couldn't do anything about the scene, which was firmly controlled by Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen went black again, and that eerie music reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think it's over? No. There's something more exciting! Here, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Bryant. Congratulations on becoming the father of another man's child and taking responsibility for this group of indulgent men and women! Great man, I admire you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the sound ended, the paternity test report was also presented on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was so big, and correspondingly, the screen was also very big. The report was displayed on the screen, with each letter being enlarged to a size that was big enough for everyone present to see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The displayed "no blood relation" above was enough to shock the Bryant family present at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle couldn't believe it. After meticulously planning everything, she was about to marry Elliott. However, at this final moment, her dream shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood still, feeling helpless and trembling uncontrollably all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively walked up to Elliott and tried to grab his hand, but Elliott forcefully pushed her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, are you okay? What happened to you? Quick, call an ambulance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden cry came out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard the scream and quickly stood up, only to see Cormac spitting out a mouthful </span><span>of blood and collapsing directly onto the wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac was angered by all of this and, in a moment of emotional excitement, fell into a coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene immediately descended into chaos, and after witnessing such a farce, all the guests seemed to suddenly snap out of it. Everyone began whispering to each other. Some people secretly mocked, while others shouted in disbelief. There were even those who took pleasure in the misfortune, delighted to see the Bryant family, the top-ranked family in Hoswich city, make such a big joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of medical staff quickly rushed in and carried away the unconscious Cormac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura seemed to have just realized what had happened. She suddenly went crazy and rushed towards Giselle, fiercely slapping her in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura pointed at the paternity test on the screen, her face distorted out of anger, and cursed Giselle, "Giselle, you bitch! Are these videos true? Tell me, speak up!"</span></p></div>
