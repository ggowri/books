        <h1>Chapter 391 Rage</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To me, Quinn was always the odd one out. No one'd never guess he came from one of those ancient aristocratic families in Hoswich, like the Woods family. They'd been around forever, dabbling in all sorts&mdash;business, politics, you name it. But they were like ghosts, lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Quinn's parents were into business, with their fingers in a bunch of pies, but he never really talked about how powerful they were. Sly devil, huh?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People love kissing up to those in power, don't they?" Quinn said, grinning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled at his sass, about to shoot back when my phone suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly grabbed my phone and saw it was my mom calling, so I picked up right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I picked up, my mom's crying voice blasted through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, get to the hospital now! Someone's trying to drag your dad out of here and kick us away!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart jumped into my throat at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, take a deep breath and ignore them for now. I'm on my way!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my mom's frantic voice, I ended the call in a daze, not even bothering to chat with Quinn. I spun around and bolted towards my car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn grabbed my arm. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't have let Elliott transfer my dad to another hospital in the first place! Quinn, just keep doing your thing. I've gotta get to the hospital now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so steamed that I didn't have time to explain much to Quinn. I hopped into my car and revved the engine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked super worried, like he wanted to tag along. But just then, a stunning woman with short hair called out to him from behind and dashed over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too worked up to see who she was. I just peeled out of there and raced to Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I barged into my dad's ward, chaos was everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broken bits of stuff littered the floor, and the flowers were all smashed. My mom sat in a chair, bawling her eyes out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, in a hospital gown, stood with her mom and a bunch of bodyguards. She shot me this haughty look, like she owned the place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor and nurse on duty were there too. Seeing me, the doctor pulled me aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mrs. Bryant. We tried to stop it, but they said it was Mrs. Laura Bryant's orders, so we had to back off. Hope you understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understand? How could I possibly understand why everything was such a mess?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was still in that bed, fighting for his life. Couldn't he get a little peace?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to Giselle, my voice dripping with rage. "Giselle, what's your deal? Don't forget, Elliott and I are still married!"</span></p></div>
