        <h1>Chapter 640 The Most Exaggerated Video</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound system in the banquet hall was loud, with excellent effects, and the visuals were clear. The facial features of this child were magnified incredibly clearly, and it abruptly appeared in front of everyone, accompanied by the discussion of two nurses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The venue, which was just bustling moments ago, suddenly fell into a moment of tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room seemed to have agreed on something, as they all put down their forks, shut their mouths, and simultaneously adopted the same stunned expression. For a moment, the entire venue froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This earth-shattering news, undoubtedly, was difficult to take in for everyone, which made the table full of expensive delicacies hard to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds later, it was Laura who first reacted. She quickly shouted loudly in the venue, "Who? Who released these photos and videos? Who? Turn it off, turn it off immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura went crazy and immediately ran onto the stage, shouting wildly into the microphone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ken was not easy to deal with. No matter how hard the on-site staff tried to shut it down, that video kept playing on a loop, and the two nurses' thoughtless discussion felt like needles, deeply piercing the hearts of the Bryant family on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle appeared extremely flustered at this moment. She helplessly grabbed Elliott's hand, but he was furious. In front of everyone, Elliott directly shook off her hand and immediately kept a safe distance from Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's facial expressions changed rapidly. Her eyes looked so anxious, and her body trembled slightly. Giselle desperately bit her lip, trying to calm herself down. Clearly, this sudden turn of events left her completely unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't shut it down. I simply can't! Is there a problem with the hotel's system?" Faced with Laura's continuous urging, the manager became so anxious that he broke out in a sweat and started shouting frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, the big screen suddenly turned dark. Soon after, strange music started playing, and then a strange male voice suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think it's over? Next, let me show you even more exciting scenes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was clearly altered. From the tone, I immediately recognized it was Ken's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, another video appeared on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the footage of Giselle at the vacation hotel that Ken had filmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched Giselle's expression with great interest. At the moment when this video was played in public, she trembled in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle covered her chest, looked at the screen with extreme nervousness, and almost couldn't stand steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene gradually shifted from a normal gathering to an R-rated scene. And just as the camera was about to focus on her face, Giselle couldn't control herself and shouted, "Stop! Stop it now! Who is playing this prank? Who is it? Turn it off! Where </span><span>is the manager? Are you not going to handle this situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was franticly screaming at the scene, her previously dignified and ladylike appearance long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood there motionless. He stared at the screen, so I couldn't see his face and didn't know what he was thinking at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with this scene, there was one thing for sure. Laura, who had just been panicked and shouting frantically, suddenly became calm. She looked at the big screen in shock and fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Laura had recognized the female protagonist in the video was Giselle, the woman who was going to marry Elliott, the woman who she had held a grand ceremony for.</span></p></div>
