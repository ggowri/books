        <h1>Chapter 321 Injured</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the scuffle, some one took a nasty bite at Elliott's arm when he wasn't looking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That man definitely bit hard. Now, Elliott's arm has a bright red bite mark around it, and blood is oozing out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll grab the first aid kit and clean you up." I said, rushing to get our kit from the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled out the iodine and cotton swabs, ready to disinfect, but he stopped me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't answered my question," he kept wondering why I always turned to Quinn first whenever something happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as I looked at him, I didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called Quinn because I consider him my most trusted friend, that's the only reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott seemed to have the wrong idea about me and Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it because you were with him when I called?" I asked, puzzled why he showed up before Quinn did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he suddenly lifted my chin. As he looked at me, there was a hint of sadness in his eyes. "That doesn't matter. What's important is I want to know, where am I in your heart now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was him in my heart?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This question was really hard for me to answer for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had asked me this before, I would have told him without hesitation that I loved him and that he was the love of my life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I couldn't say those words anymore. But one thing I was sure of, he was still important to me. And so far, I hadn't fallen in love with anyone else but him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Family, maybe?" I finally said after pondering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three years of marriage, we were family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for whether he was my lover, I was not sure right now. Because I didn't know what I meant to him, could he end up falling for someone else like he did with Giselle in our past life and abandoned me again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My response made Elliott's head hang low.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Family..." he muttered softly, followed by a self-deprecating laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen Elliott like this before. The cold smirk on his face seemed especially desolate under the cold, white light of my home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me disinfect it for you first." I said, gripping his arm and attempting once more to apply iodine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott brushed my hand away. He stood up straight, his voice cold as he said, "No need, I'm leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your arm is still bleeding, Elliott," I instinctively exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just glanced at me coldly and said, "I'm bleeding inside too, not just my arm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, he left without another word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at his retreating figure, the weight of his words lingering heavily on my heart.</span></p></div>
