        <h1>Chapter 853: Powerfully Protecting His Wife</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, Diego Rodr&iacute;guez is the same behind-the-scenes big shot Dalton had mentioned before, the one who lent him a helping hand while filming in Mexico.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Madeline Mayers?" Diego Rodr&iacute;guez was clearly taken aback, but quickly scoffed, "So what if she's the boss lady? She's still just a woman. Women in Mexico, they're worth nothing. Mr. Lewis, she offended me tonight. I can forgive her this once, for your sake. But she has to toast me a drink, no, at least ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego Rodr&iacute;guez has always been a law unto himself. Despite knowing full well that this is Hoswich city, he still struts around with such audacity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in his eyes, women seemed to be nothing more than lambs for the slaughter. This arrogant demeanor and his blatant disregard for women infuriated me to no end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially in recent years, numerous kidnapping cases have occurred domestically, with many women mysteriously deceived and then vanished, all subtly linked to Mexico. It's clear to see, this man, who cloaks himself in the guise of a businessman, has inflicted untold harm on countless women in the shadows, to be able to utter such audacious words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, quit dreaming. This ain't Mexico, you mess with my girl, you're the one who should be apologizing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even utter a word, Elliott had already spoken, his voice icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton stood in the middle, his gaze shifting between me and Diego, a hint of discomfort in his eyes. But instinctively, he sided with me. He said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rodriguez, Ms. Mayers can't hold her liquor. How about we bury the hatchet for my sake? To show my sincerity, I'll match you drink for drink, up to ten rounds. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?" Diego Rodr&iacute;guez's scoff echoed throughout the room. "Who do you think you are? Without me, your pathetic movie wouldn't have seen the light of day. So what if this lady boss has money to burn? She'll end up losing her shirt!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After barking at Dalton, Diego arrogantly turned his gaze towards me. He stretched out his hand, adorned with gold rings, pointed at me, and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think it through, Madeline Mayers! If you toast an apology to me, I'll let today's incident slide. But if not, watch your back. Don't give me a chance to get back at you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were laced with a palpable threat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a frosty stare. He looked every bit the scoundrel, but I wasn't scared. I said, icily:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You started this harassment. If anyone should be apologizing, it should be you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rodriguez, we're all in the business world here. Despite being from different countries, mutual respect is the bare minimum. Your attitude isn't doing you any favors in Hoswich City. I'd advise you to think it through."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott responded coolly. At the same time, he gave my hand a firm squeeze, as if lending me strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego Rodriguez quickly weighed the pros and cons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Bryant family is the top-notch clan in Hoswich city, and the Glory Group's current strength is not to be underestimated. I believe that Diego Rodr&iacute;guez, having come here, must have understood the situation beforehand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott finished speaking, Diego fell silent for a moment. Then, with a cold huff, he casually grabbed a petite model and stormed off to his room, no longer engaging in our standoff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he didn't apologize, his actions spoke volumes, indicating a step back on his part.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Diego left, a palpable sense of relief washed over Dalton. He hurriedly approached me, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologies, Ms. Mayers. It's my fault for not introducing you sooner, which led to this unfortunate mishap. I hope you won't hold it against me."</span></p></div>
