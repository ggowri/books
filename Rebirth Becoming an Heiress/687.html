        <h1>Chapter 687 Refusing Quinn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, do you know what you were saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Branson spoke coldly at this moment. He set down his fork, his dignified face showing a hint of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I deceived your feelings. However, please rest assured that Quinn and I have only been friends so far. As a friend, what I most want to see is him being happy. I won't burden him, let alone be with him with a child. Although I am divorced, it doesn't mean I have no limits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up. After expressing my attitude, I prepared to leave here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words plunged everyone present into a long silence, which felt suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly picked up my bag and coat, bid them farewell politely, and immediately walked out of the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood still at first, but shortly after I left, he immediately chased after me and grabbed my wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why were you so stubborn? Why didn't you discuss this matter with me before confessing it to Jessica and Branson directly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn. To be honest, after saying these words, I felt incredibly relaxed at this moment and no longer had the previous burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I know you've been good to me, but I can't just enjoy these kindnesses for no reason. The feud between me, the Bryant family, and Giselle has come to an end, so I can't hold you back anymore. Zara is doing well. I can tell she really likes you, so you should cherish her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is it because of Zara?" Quinn misunderstood my meaning. He sighed and then said with a bitter smile, "Madeline, you've misunderstood. I only see her as a sister. Come back with me. I will explain everything to my parents properly. Jessica and Branson are very open-minded. If I have truly made a decision, they will support me just the same. I have confidence in that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't confess because of Zara, but because this is something that should have been confessed. Quinn, I made it very clear, I can't continue to hold you back. My conscience can't bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn, my gaze calm and sincere. At the same time, I freed myself from his hand and instinctively stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't feel that way. I have said before, protecting you is my lifelong responsibility! Madeline, why do you have to be so stubborn? There is no woman who doesn't need to be cared for. Just stay by my side peacefully and feel the happiness I give you, isn't that good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me perplexedly and once again advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were mutual love, it would be fine, but if it means sacrificing yourself for my happiness, then I would rather not. You have already done so much for me, so I cannot continue any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head firmly. No matter what he said, I still politely declined his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn! What are you doing standing outside? Come in quickly. Branson wants you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, Zara's clear and pleasant voice came from behind Quinn.</span></p></div>
