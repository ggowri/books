        <h1>Chapter 114 Elliott Is Not a Man</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder continued to rumble, and I, like a trembling little lamb, huddled helplessly in his arms, afraid to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gently comforted me. Sensing my fear, he suddenly lightly touched my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was a child, I was afraid of thunder. My mother would also hold me in her arms and comfort me softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in Elliott's arms, I felt a sense of security like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder continued, but it seemed to be getting quieter. His warm embrace made me feel drowsy. Soon, I, who was extremely tired, fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up again, it was already the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I discovered that the new blanket I brought had fallen on the ground, while I was covering myself with Elliott's blanket. There were still traces of him lying next to me. However, he had already gotten up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I sleep in Elliott's arms all night last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he so good? Was he willing to patiently comfort me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my eyes, sat up from the bed, and felt moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reflection, I began to doubt if Elliott was even a man. I lay in his arms, wearing a thin nightgown, and to my surprise, he didn't do anything to me. Instead, he held me and fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did my figure not make him desire me to such an extent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do adult men not easily have physiological reactions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doesn't he see any charm in me at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but lose confidence, and a sense of frustration arose. At the same time, I quickly comforted myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not that I lacked charm, but Elliott wasn't a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, it must be like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gritted my teeth and got out of bed. I was so angry that I almost knocked over a bottle of toner in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't forget what I had to do today. After getting ready, I quickly put on makeup. Then, I searched for a long white dress with floral patterns from the wardrobe. I casually tied my hair up in a bun and sprayed it with hairspray before heading downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, Laura liked my gentle dressing style, she thought it made me look virtuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this floral dress was bought by me in the past specifically to cater to Laura's preferences. However, I haven't worn this dress yet because I have had fewer opportunities to meet Elliott's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked down the stairs and Elliott was already waiting for me downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a casual outfit, a navy blue turtleneck sweater, and light gray pants. His hair was meticulously groomed. He sat there, looking like an international supermodel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me, Elliott said, "Let's have some breakfast first. Then, we'll leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat in front of the laptop, furrowing his brows, possibly dealing with official matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the dining table, Sean had prepared a glass of fresh milk, a slice of bread, and a serving of salad for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and walked over to finish my breakfast. Afterward, I went out with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant Villa was located in the old town area of Hoswich, in the former busiest district of Hoswich. Its surroundings were filled with ancient buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's parents were nostalgic. Despite having multiple properties in Hoswich, they still preferred to live in the Bryant Villa. Because of its old age, every time I stepped into that place, it felt like stepping into a castle.</span></p></div>
