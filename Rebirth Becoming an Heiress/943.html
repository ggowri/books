        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of honking horns came from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's high</span><span>-</span><span>profile admission of love drew the vehement displeasure of countless drivers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he let go of me and gave me an evil smile, he stepped on the gas and immediately crossed the crosswalk and sped down the road with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was fine, the sky was blue, the vehicles on the road were getting fewer and fewer, and the road was getting wider and wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Don't we have dinner tonight? Where are you taking me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The dinner </span><span>will be started</span><span> late</span><span>r</span><span>, I'll take you to a place first.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he suddenly turned at the next intersection, and an imposing villa garden was presented in front of my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was under the impression that this place was a real estate newly invested and developed by Bryant Group, with the main focus being on high</span><span>-</span><span>grade villas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place is currently located away from the main city center, but it is said that the city government intends to move towards this side in the future, so in the future, this place will surely become the new downtown area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, what did Elliott bring me here for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit puzzled, and by this time he had already swiped his card and led me into the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The construction here has already entered the finishing stage, an imposing villa stood in front of me, it's worthy of being a high</span><span>-</span><span>end villa area, every villa is a single house design, and the garden design inside is very special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What did you bring me here for?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Do you see those two villas in front?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped the car, pointed at two villas with the exact same style not far ahead, and asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Well, then?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with some surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>There's one I'm going to give to my parents for their retirement, while the other one is for you and your parents. I'll show you the building on the right.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said as he took me by the shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, however, couldn't help but be surprised, the villa here was worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he was giving it to me without any discussion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I panicked and waved my hand in shock, pushing him away in a hurry:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No</span><span>,</span><span> Elliott, I have a house, I don't need you to give it to me, I really don't</span><span> need it</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like everything was moving too fast, even though we had been a couple before, we weren't in a committed relationship right now after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a little hard for me to accept that he was giving me high end costume jewelry and a house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, didn't care and his gaze became sincere as he took my hand:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I know you do, and I know you're not doing too badly with Glory Group. But I've already signed a gift agreement for the villa and had it transferred to you through a lawyer. You suffered so much for the birth of Noah, but I have not been with you, I have no other better way to compensate, only through these to make my conscience a little more peaceful. This villa belongs to you whether you accept it or not. You will first go over with me to visit it, and then, I will tell you about my conception, okay?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott really knows too well how to convince me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he still had his old high and mighty demeanor of not bothering to explain himself, I would not have been able to accept any of his gifts no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I now gradually realized that he would no longer be as silent as before in whatever he did, but would tell me his inner thoughts in great detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really gradually did open his heart to me, and unlocked the heart defense in his heart that he once had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt his sincerity and genuineness, and the security in my heart suddenly grew again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige always says that where a man's love is, money is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I didn't understand this, and I thought it was a superficial thing to talk about money between lovers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, nowadays, through Elliott's actions and the contrast between his former and present, I gradually confirmed that he was now treating me as if he really wanted to get back together with me, and not as a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, I accompanied him inside the cottage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had obviously arranged everything, and we went straight into the interior of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that this villa was actually like my old house, not only did I have my mom's beloved flower beds and trellises, but I also had a customized chess board for my dad, and there was also a special children's playground set up, which was obviously meant for Noah to play with on weekdays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yard of this villa was three times the size of my old house, and the overall style was vintage yet upscale, and the yard looked beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I secretly marveled in my heart, Elliott took me into the villa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the inside had already been designed and decorated, just like the exterior of the house, the living room was huge, and there were separate study rooms for my dad and me, and a separate playroom for Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew my mom loved to cook, so the kitchen was spacious with all the kitchenware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The hard and soft furnishings here are all my speculations based on your old house, and I think my in</span><span>-</span><span>laws will love it. The environment here is quiet and the security facilities are very good, Noah can be very safe living here, even if he goes out alone, he doesn't need to have any worries. And the most important thing </span><span>......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said to me as he showed me around, only, he suddenly wrenched my shoulders and said solemnly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I know that you're the only child in the family, and I'm the only child in the family, and your parents are very attached to Noah, as are my parents. Ever since they found out about Noah's existence, my parents have been talking about it every day, they really miss Noah and would love to see you every day, but I also understand how your parents feel, Noah was born to you and is the only grandson your parents have, they love him very much, that's why they're so defensive towards me. They must have been afraid that I would take Noah away from your family, so I ended up designing these two villas right next to each other. This way, both your parents and my parents can see their grandchildren, and, as I thought about it, Noah I won't ask him to change his last name to Bryant, I respect your family's wishes.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words struck my heart hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't realized that he was so perceptive that he had already gotten a glimpse of what my parents were thinking just by the way my mom treated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents were wary of him because they were afraid that the Bryant family would steal their only grandson, in addition to the old grudges and Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to be so thoughtful, and, with their Bryant Group having fewer children, he was able to accept Noah not having the last name of Bryant, such generosity and tolerance is something I didn't expect </span><span>......</span></p></div>
