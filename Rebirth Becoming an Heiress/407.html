        <h1>Chapter 407 Who's There?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A yawn escaped me as I prepared for bed, but my drowsiness was shattered by the insistent ringing of the doorbell downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could be at our door at this hour?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a puzzled frown, I left the study and flicked on the lights in the living room. Peering through the peephole, I found the area outside devoid of any presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, fear pricked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would play such a prank late at night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood and waited in the silent hallway for some time, then seeing that there were no further movements out there, decided to return to my bedroom upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as I turned, the doorbell rang once more, this time urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, I rushed back to the door and checked the peephole again, but there was still no one in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down my spine as I called out, "Who's there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was only the whistle of the wind in response, with no sign of anyone outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned away again, but the doorbell rang again, each time more urgently than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through me. Crouching, I checked the peephole again, but the view remained empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was someone deliberately toying with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My instinct urged me to open the door and investigate further, but I hesitated, realizing I was alone and vulnerable. If there was indeed danger at my doorstep, I wouldn't be able to do anything to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alarm on my phone monitoring system sounded, and I quickly checked the surveillance feed. Simultaneously, the doorbell rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the feed, I saw a figure dressed in black at the doorstep. His face was obscured by a hood, but it seemed to be a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his face hidden and his fully black attire, I couldn't discern his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incessant ringing intensified my unease. Trembling, I watched the figure on the surveillance feed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the person outside realized I wasn't opening the door, he began forcefully pounding on it, the repeated thuds echoing through the midnight air, intensifying the terror of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body broke out in a cold sweat, and just as suddenly as it began, the pounding ceased. But as I thought the person had left, a sinister silhouette appeared at the living room window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the sound of shattering glass as the intruder, unable to breach the door, attempted to force entry through the window!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the shadow at the window and hearing the frantic crashing of the window, I felt a chill run down my spine. Hastily, I reached for my phone to call the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, the roar of a car engine filled the air outside my home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the engine quieted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the surveillance footage, I spotted a white Porsche Cayenne parked in my yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, the figure who moments ago tried to break into my home vanished...</span></p></div>
