        <h1>Chapter 47 Beef Noodles</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so late, how about we have something to eat? What do you want to eat? I can go and make it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really wanted to get out of this embarrassing situation right now, and on top of that, I was feeling a bit hungry, so I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, then you cook spaghetti, and after eating, we'll go to the banquet together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly responded and went to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took out spaghetti from the cupboard and then got some beef from the refrigerator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to cook many dishes, but because I loved eating beef spaghetti since I was young, my mom forced me to learn how to cook beef spaghetti after I grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother said that girls must learn a few signature dishes, not for the purpose of serving their future husbands and in-laws, but for themselves, so that they don't have to rely on others when they want to eat something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I always disagreed with what my mom said, but now, after experiencing setbacks and making mistakes, I understand that many of the things said by those who have been through it actually have their own reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started preparing pasta, and in the living room, the sound of Elliott making a phone call came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today is the mid-year banquet. Although he doesn't need to personally prepare for such an event with his position, some details still need to be consulted with him before making decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over here, a pleasant fragrance quickly filled the air, and in the living room, his voice occasionally echoed. This feeling was reminiscent of the typical scent of fireworks in an ordinary household.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this kind of situation, since we got married two years ago, has happened for the first time in this house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean came into the kitchen at this time and offered to help me. Seeing the rare harmony between Elliott and me, he jokingly said, "Well, well, what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you and Mr. Bryant are starting to look more and more like a married couple. I've said it before, marriage is all about working things out together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they look like a married couple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly and subconsciously felt satisfied in my heart. But as soon as I thought about the upcoming Giselle, that little joy in my heart instantly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't experienced the previous life, I'm afraid that now, as long as Elliott is even a little bit kind to me, I wouldn't be able to resist falling, just like before, like a moth to a flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I can't, I will never be able to again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sean, it was just temporary, I wasn't the person he liked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, it doesn't matter whether you like living your life or not, what matters is compatibility. In my opinion, you and Mr. Bryant are a very suitable couple. Trust me, I won't be mistaken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean comforted me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I had already put the diced beef into the pan and stir-fried it for a while. Afterward, following my mother's previous method, I made beef spaghetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was ready, I boiled the water and then put the spaghetti into the pot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just half an hour, I had prepared three plates of beef spaghetti, and one of them, I specifically made for Sean to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>my</span><span> previous life, the only person who remained kind and unchanged towards me was this simple-minded butler. However, I only regarded him as a butler in the past, and I never truly appreciated his care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, I will do my best to make up for all the people who have sincerely cared for me in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean was very surprised. He thanked me repeatedly and praised the delicious beef spaghetti I made. Then he picked up the plate of spaghetti and happily went to the small restaurant next to us to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called Elliott over and placed two plates of cooked beef spaghetti on the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat down and saw two plates of beef spaghetti in front of him, with colors, fragrance, and taste all complete. A slightly surprised expression appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you do?"</span></p></div>
