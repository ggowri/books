        <h1>Chapter 366 His Betryal</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shuddered with shock. Elliott Also shocked, I felt his hands tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, you can eat food randomly, but you can't talk nonsense. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned around and looked Giselle, his eyes were dull and magnanimous, without any guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like he has never been with Giselle had a relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is going on?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had announced she was pregnant in front of her friends before. Elliott children, now, in front of the Bryant family say it openly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it possible? Giselle and Elliott Was there really anything between them?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart beat uneasily and strongly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also turned around and saw Giselle Wearing a white satin dress and flat shoes, she stood at the foot of the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stroked her slightly bulging belly with her hand, and her long hair was tied up in a bun behind her head casually. Her makeup was light and she looked pitiful, like a little daisy trembling in the wind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't say anything nonsense, Elliott, I am really pregnant. Moreover, it has been almost three months. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle Biting her lip lightly, looking at it weakly Elliott, that look and gesture, resemble a tolerant and aggrieved little daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Counting the time, it just so happens that I am here Louis CityThat period of time?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what's happening?" My voice quivered with uncertainty as I turned to him for answers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head throbbing with sudden pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's sigh broke the tense silence as he rose from the sofa, adding weight to the situation. "Dr. Louis confirmed Giselle's pregnancy. If you're responsible, own up to it," he urged, his tone heavy with implication.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned around, his eyes meeting Giselle's with a dull, unyielding gaze. "If I have done it, I will naturally recognize it. If I have not done it, how can I recognize it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was still frank, and it really didn't look like he was talking to Giselle What happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slept in her room that night in Dikio. You were drunk at the party you held for the clients. "Laura, joining in the confrontation, recounted a specific incident involving Giselle and Elliott, adding fuel to the fire of suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dikio? Drunk in the party?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place, my mind raced with questions. Had Elliott lied to me about his business trips? Was there more to his relationship with Giselle than he had let on?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered that Elliott and I didn't contact each other for almost half a month when I was Louis City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he clearly told me that he never takes women with him on business trips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Giselle in the team traveling with him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott lie to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body trembled violently as I stared at Elliott, searching desperately for any sign of truth in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, panic flickering across his face before it hardened into an icy mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His silence spoke volumes, leaving me to grapple with the harsh reality of the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's words echoed in my mind, confirming my worst fears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion of emotions in my head drowned out everything else. It was a deafening roar, a cacophony of confusion, anger, and heartbreak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Louis conveyed that Giselle's fetal image is stable," she said, her words measured. "When this child arrives, it will undoubtedly bring joy to our Bryant family. Your grandfather is thrilled to hear this news," Laura said, "Madeline, what Elliott did was wrong," she continued, her voice unwavering. "so as for any compensation you may require, please don't hesitate to mention it. We are committed to treating you fairly."</span></p></div>
