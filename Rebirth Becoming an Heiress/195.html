        <h1>Chapter 195 Drunk</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't understand it, so I could only smile and say, "The world of you young people, I have grown old and don't understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did I know, as soon as I uttered these words, Adam immediately reached out and patted my head. "Madeline, what are you talking about? In my opinion, you are a hundred times more beautiful than Giselle. She's just a little girl, where is the charm in that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam also ignored Rowan beside him and started praising me directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Rowan would be angry, but to my surprise, Rowan actually agreed, "Exactly, Adam has said multiple times in front of me that Madeline is a good person, and today I finally met her. Giselle is just childish, temperamental, and sometimes quite immature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I burst into laughter. I really wanted to record Rowan's words just now and send them to Giselle to listen to, so she could explode with anger all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I did not do so. After all, the show had just begun. If this could anger her, then I would have more ways to make her furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how angry Giselle was over there, I inexplicably became happy, and I continued to play around with Adam and Rowan for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, we left the restaurant and went back to rest separately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a shower at the hotel, I put on a bathrobe and sat on the lounge chair on the terrace for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold moonlight fell on the white terrace, and the distant sea was silent, faintly hearing the sound of waves occasionally hitting the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling a bit lonely when Quinn suddenly gave me a video call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I answered the call, he winked and made funny faces at me through the video. Then, he turned the camera towards Elliott lying on the sofa and whispered to me, "See that? He's had too much to drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you guys were drinking," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's camera shook for a moment, and then it became quiet on his end, with the video background changing to another room. His voice grew louder. "He came to see me at night, we drank together and talked about you all night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About me? What about me?" I was quite surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He said you seemed completely different, and he didn't know how to get along with you anymore. He asked me what happened to you. Can you guess what I said?" Quinn said with a laugh on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My silent heart suddenly became noisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think that Elliott was someone who could hide things better than anyone else, but I never expected that one day he would actually bring up me in a conversation with someone else, and on top of that, he was drunk. It's truly unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said it's simple, she used to love you, but not anymore," Quinn succinctly said on the other end of the phone. He then added, "So, are you satisfied with the answer I gave you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then he drank too much? No way! He never cared about me," I pretended to say casually, but deep down, my heart was in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, he drank a lot of alcohol, probably three or four bottles of red wine. After all these years, it's the first time I've seen him lose control of his emotions, and it's true," Quinn honestly said on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when I heard him say that, my heart sank instantly. For a moment, my hand holding the phone trembled slightly, and my mind was filled with thick disbelief.</span></p></div>
