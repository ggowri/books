        <h1>Chapter 90 Blushing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think I brought for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted the food bag in my hand. As soon as he saw the packaging bag, he immediately knew and showed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you go to Listen to the Wind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. I remember you loved eating their foie gras, so I packed a portion for you and brought it over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over, opened the bag, took out the foie gras, and placed it in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw this scene and his eyes softened. He didn't hesitate and gracefully put a piece of foie gras into his mouth, praising, "Still so delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's very tender. Have another piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and raised my eyebrows, indicating him to try again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a layer of ice under the lunch box, so the foie gras was very fresh. Paired with blueberry sauce, the foie gras tasted unique and tender. Because I used to love Elliott, I fell in love with the food he liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott tried another piece of foie gras. It was evident that foie gras suited his taste very well. His smile became even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listen to the Wind's food portion was not large but exquisite. Before long, Elliott finished eating the foie gras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped his mouth satisfactorily with a tissue, then he smiled and asked me, "Why did you suddenly bring me my favorite food today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled and said, "I just had dinner with Paige today. Thinking that you love foie gras, I packed it up and brought it over to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see Paige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott leaned back in his office chair. He wasn't very busy and started chatting with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We hadn't seen each other for a long time, so we had a meal together. By the way, you were looking for a long-term flower supplier before. Paige's flower plantation is excellent. I have visited it. There are many types of flowers, and she also has a professional flower arrangement team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately brought up this topic, wanting to know how Elliott would explain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott heard me say that, his eyebrows twitched slightly, and there was a hint of mischief in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me meaningfully. He was clever enough to understand my intention of trying to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew you wouldn't be kind to me for no reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, I walked behind him and massaged his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Purchasing Department has already compared. Paige's flowers are not only fresh and diverse in variety, but also available for long-term supply. Moreover, her prices are reasonable. The Bryant Group is a large enterprise that requires a large quantity of flowers and plants. Can you help support Paige's business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My icy fingers touched Elliott's neck as I gently massaged him. He felt comfortable and didn't push me away. Instead, he held onto my hands, causing me to lean and press against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were too close. I was unguarded and blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I considered Paige. You know Giselle helped me last time, and I owe her a favor. Besides, my father also owes a favor to their family. So, I plan to have Giselle's mother supply the flowers, which can be considered as support to her family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gently caressed my hand. His voice was soft. Compared to his previous indifference towards me, he had become gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, we were no longer hostile towards each other. In this moment, we were like a couple discussing matters.</span></p></div>
