        <h1>Chapter 566 A Tad Too Involved</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I lifted my head to survey the surroundings, Elliott was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure if the person I saw from a distance was him. So, I turned to Cathy and asked, "Cathy, was the gentleman sitting at the back-right corner just now the president of the Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cathy seemed puzzled by my question at first, then shook her head. "We did invite Mr. Bryant, but he declined, citing a scheduling conflict. He certainly wouldn't be sitting at the back if he were here. Do you know Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few in Hoswich knew about my past marriage to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cathy was newly appointed and was even less informed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know him. I was just asking out of curiosity," I denied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though my doubt lingered, thinking, "Could I have really mistaken someone else for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries with Cathy, I headed to the parking lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, I heard Elliott's voice behind me just as I reached for the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did well today. Your speech was surprisingly passionate and persuasive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning around, I saw Elliott emerging from behind a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was correct. The man sitting at the back was indeed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled, "Thank you for the compliment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached me and continued, "Your company's valuation surpasses the Bryant Group's. That must feel like an accomplishment. Your business acumen is commendable. It looks like I underestimated you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this an affirmation from my ex-husband?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled, "I've been lucky. My company's valuation exceeding the Bryant Group's is only temporary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott approached with his hands in his pockets, giving me a once-over before admiring, "You look stunning today, sophisticated and elegant. But perhaps you should opt for more conservative attire in the future. Drawing too much attention might make those entrepreneurs lose their focus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he subtly saying I'm pretty?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I furrowed my brows, half amused and exasperated. "What I wear is my business, ex-husband. You're being a tad too involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's speech was a success. I was in a good mood and didn't want to argue with him. So, I kept my tone polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You hardly look like you're pregnant at all. Are you trying to deceive me? You being with Quinn, is that a deception too?" Elliott suddenly got closer as he spoke, his gaze piercing as if trying to see through me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled and pushed him away. "Elliott, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's one thing if you're getting back at me, but I don't want you to joke about your body. If you're not pregnant, that's for the best. Stay away from Quinn. He's not right for you." Elliott leaned in close to my ear, issuing his warning once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were earnest as if he knew Quinn inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, while Quinn and I were just good friends, I found him a hundred times more reliable than Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure what Elliott meant by Quinn not being suitable for me, but I trusted my judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "If you have time to advise me, why don't you indulge in your playboy nature and charm a few more girls? Don't act like you're devoted to me. I'm not buying it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, I pushed past him and continued walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a sudden dizziness overwhelmed me before I could take more than a few steps. Whether it was due to only having a glass of milk in the morning to maintain my figure or pregnancy-related low blood sugar, I couldn't tell.</span></p></div>
