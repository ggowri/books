        <h1>Chapter 255 Phone</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been at the hospital, and as soon as the test results were out, Doctor Louis took the report to Cormac's room. If you don't believe me, you can go check at the hospital yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked at me triumphantly, her demeanor now openly hostile towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body continued to tremble uncontrollably while she had already finished a whole cup of cappuccino, looking more content than I ever did when drinking alcohol.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Cormac received the results, he was furious and immediately called Elliott, demanding he divorce you as soon as possible. Madeline, your joy won't last long. So, find a way out for yourself quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Giselle called the waiter to pay the bill, and then she left gracefully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slumped in my chair, staring at the report, feeling a wave of despair wash over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Severe endometriosis has rendered me congenitally infertile? What does this even mean?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have never been intimated with anyone, so how could I have this illness?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is all of this really not just one of Giselle's cruel pranks?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it hard to believe, so I logged into the hospital's website, entered my name, and retrieved the report. To my shock, the report on the screen was identical to the one Giselle had given me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, I stood there in a daze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the report and walked out of the caf&eacute; in a trance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight outside was blinding, and not far away, a young couple pushed a white baby stroller past me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at the adorable child in the stroller, feeling a sudden pang in my heart, tears streaming down uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Am I never going to have my own child in this lifetime?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is congenital endometriosis?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never heard of such an illness before and never imagined that someone like me, who had never slept with anyone, would be associated with such a disease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in my thoughts, I sat down on a nearby stone bench, searching on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The professional terms and infertility cases on the webpage left me stunned and frightened. Just then, an unknown number called.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered in a daze, weakly saying hello.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man's voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Mrs. Bryant? I am Doctor Louis. I regret to inform you that the test results show you have severe congenital endometriosis, and furthermore, I have found signs of early ovarian failure. All results indicate a very low chance of pregnancy for you. If you seek timely treatment, there might still be a glimmer of hope. I recommend you come to the hospital for a follow-up soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately realized that this was the authoritative expert that Cormac had recommended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already feeling devastated, I was not prepared for him to call and deliver this news.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those professional terms weighing in my heart, my mind was thrown into chaos. Without waiting for him to finish, I hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after hanging up, my phone rang again. This time, it was Quinn calling.</span></p></div>
