        <h1>Chapter 703 Should We Remarry?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words had a hint of humor, and I couldn't help but laugh even more happily. "Marcus, how could you and Barry possibly be a couple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked embarrassed. "Stop making fun of me. Let's go, I'll take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got on Marcus's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, he noticed that I had been silent all along, so he asked me, "Madeline, considering how Elliott is pursuing you now, are you considering remarrying? After all, your child is about to be born, and having a complete family would be beneficial for the child..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Marcus wanted to say something, but I interrupted him directly and shook my head firmly. "It's impossible. I am not that kind of person. While it would be nice for the child to have a complete family, even without one, since I have chosen to bring him into this world, I will do everything in my power to give him the greatest happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at me deeply. "It seems like he didn't impress you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled bitterly and said, "Whatever he does, it can't move me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's face showed some emotion, and then he suddenly said softly, "But, I didn't want to see you in pain, Madeline. Sometimes I wonder, if I hadn't joined the army that year, would the story have had a different ending?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words made my heart tremble slightly, and I instantly sensed the deeper meaning behind his words. Unable to resist, I turned my head and glanced at him. "Marcus, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled awkwardly and said, "Don't overthink it, Madeline. I was just reflecting on fate. I am a divorced man, and I know the pain and turmoil that divorce brings. I also know that, even though you don't say anything on the surface, there are some deep-seated wounds in your heart that are hard to heal. I just feel that if I had stayed back then, maybe we could have started a relatively pure love affair, and perhaps our wish for a lifelong commitment could have come true. Of course, I'm only talking about 'what if'."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expressed it very subtly, but I was able to fully understand his meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like me. We were both pure in love and treated affection seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like us actually desire a lifelong relationship more than anyone else. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to continue loving Elliott for so many years despite being overlooked by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reality, however, dealt us a harsh blow. We all got divorced, and our once everlasting wish became a luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, if I were to go back to the time of my first love, I would definitely prefer myself to have never met Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were possible to go back, if Marcus hadn't suddenly left at that time, perhaps there would have been a real chance between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the word "if" itself represents impossibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, in this world, there are no 'what ifs'. You are you, and I am me. Although neither of us fulfilled our initial intention of love, living like this now, I don't think it's so bad, is it?" I smiled lightly and responded to Marcus's words with a hint of indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, however, tenderly touched my head and suddenly said, "Hmm, if there were such an if, I would rather choose to go back to that time when I could choose not to join the army, but to stay firmly by your side. Silly girl, seeing you like this now, I actually... feel very sorry for you."</span></p></div>
