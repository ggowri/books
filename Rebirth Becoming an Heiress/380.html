        <h1>Chapter 380 Fetal Distress</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean finally reacted and immediately called for emergency help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held Giselle. He initially intended to place her on the sofa, but Giselle held onto his collar tightly, like a struggling kitten on the brink of death, emanating a sense of helplessness and frailty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a situation, surely no man's heart would remain unaffected, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, clasping my hands tightly, staring blankly as Elliott, </span><span>who </span><span>right before my eyes, tenderly cared for another woman</span><span> who</span><span> carrying his child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her complexion was so pale, her expression so moving, her body so delicate, and the crimson at the hem of her skirt so vivid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of life, his actions were understandable, yet why did my heart ache so much? It hurt so much that it made me almost breathless, almost unable to stand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle kept making fragile sounds, completely capturing Elliott's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed flustered too. He probably didn't expect that a slight push from him would lead to such serious consequences.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, he didn't consider me, let alone what I might be thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept looking down at Giselle, and seeing her in pain, he couldn't help but comfort her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ambulance will be here soon, just hold on a little longer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, our child... Will our child be okay? You must save it, please save it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle grabbed his collar, as if holding onto a lifeline, her eyes filled with tears, so pitiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Elliott's lips move. He pondered for a moment and finally said, "The child will be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child... their child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That word was like a curse, swirling constantly in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body staggered again. Thankfully, Sean noticed my distress, walked over, and supported me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the ambulance could be heard at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing it, without hesitation, Elliott picked up Giselle and rushed out like an arrow. Nicole also followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt dizzy, my mind blank. At this critical moment, I didn't know what to think, I just followed my instincts and went after them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambulance didn't wait for me. It flew away with Elliott and Nicole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt like it had been stabbed by countless knives, bloody and heavy. Yet despite this, I couldn't give up, I had to go and see what was happening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly grabbed a car from the garage, stepped on the gas, and sped out of Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chased after the ambulance, speeding all the way to Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Giselle being carried on a stretcher, with Elliott escorting her all the way, and they quickly disappeared through the gates of Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I parked and reached the emergency room's entrance, the operating room was already flashing red lights, with Elliott and Nicole sitting on either side of the resuscitation room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked utterly dejected. His hands and shirt still bore specks of blood, looking so distressing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wanted to approach. But at that moment, a sharp voice echoed in the corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Giselle? Is the child okay? Oh my god, how could this happen..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Laura's voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing high heels, and her footsteps sounded rushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she passed by me, she forcefully pushed me aside and rushed towards Elliott, asking in panic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, how did you find out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood up. Seeing Laura running over, he looked somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have you done? Why did Giselle have such an accident? She's carrying the heir of our Bryant family! If anything happens, you'll see how I deal with you."</span></p></div>
