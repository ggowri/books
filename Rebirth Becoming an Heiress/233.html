        <h1>Chapter 233 Stopgap Measures</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was a good cook, and I enjoyed the breakfast very much. While eating happily, I asked, "I see, my pretty mom. Won't Dad come with us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad has an important meeting in the morning, so he won't go. By the way, I heard your dad say that you asked the company's financial officer for a financial statement. What do you need that for? You can't read it," Lily asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I can't read it, but I can learn. I will help my dad manage the company in the future, so I must have knowledge in all aspects," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dad said you would be tired from managing the company. Besides, you are married to Elliott, and having children will be a priority in the next few years. But Jade doesn't plan to get married yet. It would be more appropriate to let her be in charge so that you just need to be a shareholder behind the scenes. Running a company is too tiring. Your dad doesn't want you to work so hard," said Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was suddenly shocked. I reminded Austin a while ago, yet I didn't expect him to still consider letting Jade run the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he did this for me, only I knew what Jade was up to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I can do it. You tell my dad that no matter what, he can't let Jade be his successor. You must listen to me on this matter. I know running a company is hard, but there is no easy job. Rather than working for others, I might as well develop our family's industry. I'm my dad's daughter. Since he could start a business from scratch, I can be capable, too. Moreover, I have taken management courses and can learn quickly," I hurriedly told Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at me and said lovingly, "But when you have a child, you'll focus on your family. Elliott told us some time ago that he didn't want you to work so hard and wanted you to have a baby soon."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's sudden change of mind seemed to have something to do with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must have known I would disagree if he tried to persuade me to give up my job, so he wanted to take advantage of my parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, before Elliott and my relationship is stable, it would be irresponsible for the child if I rushed into having a baby. Besides, even if I want to have a baby, it doesn't mean I have to be a housewife. Nowadays, many women can have their families and careers. If others can do it, so can I. Please persuade Dad not to let Jade take over the company. I recently found a lot of loopholes in the statements, and these loopholes are related to her and her father. Dad has trusted them so much over the years." I persuaded Lily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was smart. After hearing my words, she immediately understood the key, and her eyes suddenly became alert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I told your dad long ago that although we are family, we should still be careful. They can get some benefits secretly, but they can't go too far."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "From what I know, they got more than just a little benefit. Moreover, I have investigated privately and discovered that Jade had bought a lot of real estate at home and many houses abroad in the past few years. She is an employee and owns very few shares. Where did she get so much money? Think about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily immediately slapped her forehead and stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "No wonder every time I went out to a party, people asked me if I have a daughter, saying that they often saw Jade's name in the purchase information of the new buildings. Now, I see why! Don't worry. I'll tell your dad about this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's words reassured me a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I knew these were just stopgap measures. If I wanted my family to be stable, the only way for me was to gain a foothold in Glory Group as soon as possible so that Austin could see Jade's true color and kick her and her dad out.</span></p></div>
