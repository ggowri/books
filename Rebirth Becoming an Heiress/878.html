        <h1>Chapter 878: The Sushi He Made Himself</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl who's quite like me, that would be Lisa Fox.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She has no connection with Giselle, so why would she come to see Giselle's child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked the dean in utter surprise:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The woman you're talking about, who seems so much like me, is her last name Fox?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dean pondered for a moment, then, with a firm nod, he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed. She never mentioned her name, but I did catch it once on a donation form she filled out. It was Fox, Lisa Fox. The name was unique, so it stuck with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did she say anything every time she came over? Do you know what her relationship is with the kid's mom?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dean shook his head, saying, "She doesn't say much, just comes to see the child. Sometimes she brings clothes and formula for the baby. I've heard from the nurses that she's instructed them to take good care of this child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems she genuinely cares for this child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her life had never intertwined with Giselle's before, so why was she so deeply invested in this child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I left the orphanage, questions swirling in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I returned to Serenity Villa, Elliott had already prepared dinner, waiting for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was adorned with exquisite sushi, my absolute favorites, identical to the ones Quinn had dropped that day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott is really starting to pay attention to the details now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the sight of him wearing a cartoon apron was a stark contrast to his usual aloof demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused for a moment, a chuckle escaping my lips as I said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come you're wearing this apron? You used to refuse to wear it, even if it killed you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I never cooked, I had no idea it could be so messy. I specifically went to a Japanese restaurant to learn how to make sushi. This is what I spent my entire afternoon on, give it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at the sushi on the table, his voice brimming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look of anticipation for praise, just like a puppy waiting for its master's approval after doing a task.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up a salmon hand roll and took a bite, not expecting much. To my surprise, it was incredibly delicious. Moreover, the salmon was so flavorful and much fresher than what you'd get at a sushi shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The taste is quite good, this fish is so fresh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but give Elliott a big thumbs up, showering him with praise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This fish was specially hauled from the deep sea and delivered to me in no time. The salmon sold in stores just doesn't cut it. This is the real deal, the true taste of salmon. I'm glad you like it. There's a whole one in the fridge, ready to be sliced up whenever you fancy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied grin spread across Elliott's face after receiving praise. Subsequently, he swung open the fridge. The salmon, neatly cut into chunks and vacuum-sealed, was perfectly arranged in the freezer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so domesticated now, even knowing how to sort out the ingredients."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gazed at the neatly arranged assortment of ingredients in the fridge, once again singing praises.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The term "dutiful" had Elliott in stitches. Without a second thought, he ripped off his apron and pulled me into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter, bright and infectious, echoed from above me. He teased, playfully saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gotta be virtuous, love! Without virtue, you might just run off with someone else. Right now, you're the one bringing home the bacon, and I'm more than happy to be your 'helpmeet'. I'll strive to be the perfect husband who loves his wife the most. Whatever you desire, I'll fulfill it all for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he lowered his head and planted a gentle kiss on my forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's really gentle now, isn't he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tender tone coupled with that doting gaze stirred a gentle ripple in my heart, almost involuntarily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just caught up in the moment. It's easy to play the perfect husband for a while, but a lifetime? That's a whole different ball game."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed him away with a laugh, deliberately keeping some distance. Otherwise, I was truly afraid that he would leave me all flustered.</span></p></div>
