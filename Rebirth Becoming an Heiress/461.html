        <h1>Chapter 461 His Meaning</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head, looked him in the eyes, and said, "I want to divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce..." Elliott's tone suddenly became excited and urgent. "Why can you say this word so easily? Does it mean that I am not important to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were so close that I could feel his heart beating rapidly. I couldn't see the expression on his face clearly, but I could feel the pain in his voice when he said these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, I once loved you. But now, I want to let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said slowly, without any emotion in my tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the last life, we seemed to be getting divorced by this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the difference was that the person who begged not to divorce was him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go?" Elliott sneered. He held my chin tightly, which made me feel extremely painful. "Don't you care about all the happy times we spent together? Madeline, I do not believe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still seemed to have great confidence in himself. I didn't find it strange. After all, I had been very humble in this relationship and even made him mistakenly think that I would die if I left him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men always had inexplicable confidence in the women who once loved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, just wait and see. Elliott, I'm tired. I only want to divorce you now, the sooner the better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a beautiful dream was completely shattered. I faced Elliott calmly and hoped that he could let me go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was getting angrier. He stared at me and suddenly said grimly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won my body and heart step by step, but now you want me to leave by just saying one sentence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held my breath. To be honest, after I stopped loving him, I was afraid that he would pester me. What's more, I didn't have that much time to waste on him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously thought of my child. If they noticed that I was pregnant, it might be difficult for me to get a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Elliott's suspicious personality, he would find out something, and by then, everything would only become more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to regulate my breathing and calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, let's face it, okay? You should accept Giselle's child and let me go. You also know that even if we continue our marriage, there will not be a happy ending between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it possible?" Unexpectedly, Elliott insisted and said, "You should know how happy we were when we only cared about each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We only cared about each other back then!" I became angry and said, "Giselle's baby will be born soon. How can we only focus on each other with that child around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really tired. I thought there was no point in arguing over such trivial matters with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I yelled, before he could say anything else, I opened the door and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the door, but I didn't expect that Quinn had been standing at the door all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of my behavior, he lost his balance, and we bumped into each other. We were all taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a surprised look and wanted to ask him why he was eavesdropping outside the door, but I held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood firm, but his hands were still on my waist. Elliott saw this and flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly said, "Madeline, we should tell Elliott the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was confused and raised my head to glance at him. At that moment, his sly look made me seem to understand what he was going to say. I was suddenly shocked.</span></p></div>
