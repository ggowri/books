        <h1>Chapter 334 You're Mine</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same problem again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected him to completely ignore Giselle's actions and words, choosing instead to repeatedly question my friendship with Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a cold laugh and looked up directly into his deep brown eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't you think this is ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous? How?" he asked, looking genuinely confused, his eyes reddening as he pressed me aggressively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need me to bring up how far you and Giselle have really gone? What right do you have to question my relationship with Quinn? Shouldn't you be the one explaining things to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waves crashed against the shore, roaring like a wild beast. My emotions escalated along with the tumultuous noise, and I shouted at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had heard every single word Giselle said tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of her boasts was like a blade stabbing my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was good that Elliott came tonight. He brought me here in the middle of the night to confront me, wasn't he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I was ready to fight with him, and I could do this all day!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you before. Giselle and I are not lovers. Madeline, I'm tired of having to explain this over and over again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, his gaze earnest and clear. He looked so damn sincere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet I couldn't help but sneer, staring directly at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Really? Not lovers? Then why is she showing off her property deeds to her friends on social media? Not lovers? She has the keys to your McLaren, going out to meet friends in the dead of night. Not lovers? She shamelessly claims you're her boyfriend in public? Not lovers, then what are you doing at this dive bar so late, Elliott? You better answer these questions one by one. Otherwise, you have no right to question me, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sea wind lashed at us again, and a shiver wracked my body. I was still weak after being sick, and my body temperature was dangerously low.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't stop the trembling. Elliott must have noticed, because he pulled me closer, holding me tighter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his words offered no warmth. He spoke coldly, "I've said it before, Giselle's like a sister to me. It's not what you think. The house was a thank you for what her family had done to the Bryants. As for my McLaren, I haven't been using it. She's been staying at my place lately, probably just using it for convenience. As for why I was at that bar? It's Quinn you should be asking about. You think I went for Giselle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words echoed in my ears. His anger flared in that last sentence, and he suddenly bit my earlobe, seemingly frustrated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanations sounded perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't believe that was as it seemed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed up at this bar because Quinn sent him a message? If he wasn't there for Giselle, it was for me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered my ears and glared at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But she told her friends she's pregnant with your child. How do you explain that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "pregnant" made my heart shudder uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a dream I'd carried across lifetimes, a dream I'd desperately hoped for.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle really was pregnant with Elliott's child, I couldn't even imagine how I would feel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked like he had heard something completely nonsense. He stared at me as if I'd lost my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how old are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean 'how old am I'?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't catch on right away.</span></p></div>
