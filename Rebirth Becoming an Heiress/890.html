        <h1>Chapter 890: Rivals in Love are Everywhere</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey and I were in the middle of a conversation when a burst of laughter echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This laugh was unique, a woman's, not crisp but rather husky. It stood out distinctly in a crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately cast my gaze over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's Lisa, she's back again. And what's eerie is that she's wearing a white tracksuit that's eerily similar to mine. However, hers is a knockoff, because there's only one set of this outfit, and it's mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all our previous encounters were mere coincidences, then this time, I'm certain she's blatantly provoking me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gaze suddenly sharpens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey gave my shoulder a pat, saying with a meaningful tone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, I didn't invite this guy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, heading in that direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa, accompanied by a pretty companion, both donned in golf caps and white lace gloves, were fully equipped and ready to go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems they're here to practice their golf swings, not to compete in a match.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's now quite the talk of the town in Hoswich City's social scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few men accompanying us had them both encircled, engaged in a lively conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I made my way over, I happened to catch the raspy sound of Lisa's voice:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys flatter me too much. I'm just from a small family, how could I possibly compare to Mrs. Bryant? I'm just a few years younger than her, but she's far more beautiful than I am. I know my place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, you're being too modest. Your family is the most prominent pharmaceutical dynasty in Onastin, and you're the only daughter. I've heard your father dotes on you immensely. Next time we have a friendly match, you should join us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My ball skills are subpar. I can't join you in the game like Mrs. Bryant. But please, stop saying I look like her. I've always been a bit of a maverick. I'm one of a kind, I don't imitate anyone, haha..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa clearly knew I was nearby, yet she still provoked me. It seems, I must respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed my lips into a smirk, stepping forward and positioning myself smack dab in the middle of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, you and I are birds of a feather. I detest being imitated or followed just as much as you do. There's a saying, 'Imitators are nothing but jesters.' Look at those celebrity impersonators, no matter how hard they try, they can never outshine the real stars. On this, we are in complete agreement!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said it with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the bosses present could all sense the aggressive undertone in my words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa's mental fortitude was impressive, she said without batting an eye:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, great minds think alike, don't they? But who would've thought? You and I, miles apart, yet strikingly similar. It's a magical twist of fate, really. Ms. Mayers, if you don't mind, I'd love to become good friends with you. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what these men liked to hear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men hate nitpicking the most. Her words make her seem quite generous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a cold chuckle, never thought she could be so shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we vibe well, we'll naturally become good friends. Ms. Fox, if you're up for it, there's more fun to be had this afternoon. Stick around and join us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I wouldn't be fooled by her. If I agreed, it would only give her more legitimate opportunities to approach me in the future.</span></p></div>
