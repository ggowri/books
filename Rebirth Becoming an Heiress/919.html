        <h1>Chapter 919: Quick Thinking</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze and instinctively turned to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up and met a pair of very familiar eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Korean was flawless, so perfect that I could hardly believe it was him who showed up just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief eye contact, the man turned his malicious gaze towards the Korean guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Korean guy cursed a few more times, and from his tone, I could tell it wasn't anything nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man didn't care; he punched the Korean guy right in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck fast and hard, catching the Korean guy completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Korean guy didn't expect to be hit. Blood gushed from his nose instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He erupted like a firecracker, clutching his bleeding head and roaring at the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, several tattooed men surrounded us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head was buzzing, and before I could react, a warm hand grabbed mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted something in English, then pulled me through the crowd, escaping the bar without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group immediately chased after us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never experienced such a thrilling moment; my adrenaline spiked, and my heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this foreign land, I had no sense of direction and blindly trusted him as we ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With long strides, he led me through the streets and alleys, clearly familiar with the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I trusted him, running like a headless chicken, clutching my skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group was hot on our heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To shake them off, he led me off the main road and into the narrow alleys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even late at night, Korea was brightly lit, probably due to the tourist season; the alleys were crowded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled me through the crowd, and gradually, the pursuers dwindled as they ran out of stamina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were both out of breath, especially me, having never run so far in one go. I was exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing we were about to be caught, and I had no strength left, he scooped me up and quickly ducked into a clothing store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The small store in the alley wasn't big. He said something to the owner, then dragged me into a fitting room and shut the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to speak, but he gestured for silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and squeezed further in, but the fitting room was too small to move back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our bodies were pressed together, both sweating from the run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sticky feeling was quite intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being so close, I could feel his strong heartbeat and hear his heavy breathing above me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up instinctively, and he looked down, his eyes deep and intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light from above made the sweat on his face sparkle like crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled at me, a bright and handsome smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he used his sleeve to wipe the sweat off my face and gently pulled my head to rest on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was breathing heavily, exhausted from the run, unable to control myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, I heard someone enter the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person spoke urgently with the owner, and I sensed it was one of our pursuers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I controlled my breathing, nestled in his arms, listening intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know if the owner would help us or if we had been seen entering the store, and I was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner's words made the person's voice rise, and he got closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he didn't believe the owner and intended to search the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I panicked and looked at the man, my eyes full of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just come for a vacation, never expecting this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps got closer, and the man pushed me down instinctively. I crouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my embarrassment, my face ended up right in front of a certain part of him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed furiously, feeling extremely awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fitting room was too small to move, so I was stuck there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the person reached the fitting room door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fitting room door couldn't be locked. Just as it was pushed open, I saw the man quickly take off his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected him to do that. What shocked me even more was that his pants dropped to the floor the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his underwear was blatantly exposed right in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly see the huge bulge in the center of his underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes widened in disbelief. I had no idea what he was trying to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the fitting room door was pushed open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the person</span><span>'</span><span>s stunned expression. He cursed loudly, probably thinking we were a couple engaged in something inappropriate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, surprisingly, he left while still cursing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We narrowly escaped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after he left that I understood the man's purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively tried to stand up, but as I did, my face accidentally brushed against his...</span></p></div>
