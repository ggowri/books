        <h1>Chapter 120 Gift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle was young and had just entered society. There were some things she might not have handled as thoroughly. For the areas where Giselle didn't do well, I hope Mr. Bryant can be more understanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole spoke at this moment. She looked at Elliott, with a hint of restraint in her smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is obvious that she was very nervous about receiving Dikio's VIP group before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Everyone needs to gain experience gradually. It's already great that you are willing to join Bryant Group. I believe Giselle's father would be happy to see her excellent performance now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jasper suddenly let out a long sigh and brought up Giselle's father. The melancholy in his words instantly engulfed all of them in an inexplicable sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jasper Bryant, what happened back then was an accident. So many years have passed, you don't have to blame yourself too much. Moreover, we are very grateful for the help the Bryant family has provided to our family over the years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole quickly and respectfully said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Giselle inherited her mother's ability to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, Jasper's brow immediately relaxed. The servants brought out the knives and forks, and Laura warmly invited them to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bag contains fresh lilies and some wild traditional medicinal materials, all of which I brought from my hometown. We don't have anything else impressive to offer, so we hope Mr. Jasper Bryant and Mrs. Laura Bryant will accept these specialties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole finished speaking and quickly pointed to the things they had brought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to bring these things. You are too kind. Giselle, you have already graduated. I don't have anything good to give you. I have been wearing this gemstone ring for many years. If you don't mind, I will give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was very generous. She directly took off a gemstone ring from her finger and stuffed it into Giselle's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, this is too valuable. I cannot accept it. I am already working now and can earn money. You don't have to give it to me. When I earn money, I will definitely buy you a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly refused. Her words showed that she was sensible and obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura has always enjoyed hearing compliments. When she heard someone say this, Laura felt even more pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it. I always wanted a daughter. Unfortunately, I wasn't lucky enough. We treat you as our own daughter. Now that you are in Hoswich, come back often when you have time. If you want to eat something, give me a call and I will have the servants make it for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was really good to Giselle. She even said in front of us that she treated Giselle like her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, it is truly Giselle's fortune that you like her so much. Giselle, you should quickly thank Mrs. Laura Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole quickly spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, you have been so kind to me. I don't even know how to repay you. If it wasn't for Elliott taking my mom to the hospital last night, I don't know what I would have done. You both are our saviors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Nicole worked together in perfect harmony. Their words made Jasper and Laura extremely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. In the future, if you have any problems, just give me a call. I also consider you as my sister. As for the mistakes at work, you don't have to worry too much about them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm Elliott unexpectedly uttered such affectionate words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, even as an outsider, I couldn't help but be moved. If it weren't for the fact that in my previous life I had already known that Giselle would replace me and become the mistress of this house, with Giselle's obedient behavior, even I would want to recognize her as my sister.</span></p></div>
