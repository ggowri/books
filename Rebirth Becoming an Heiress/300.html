        <h1>Chapter 300 Forced to Divorce</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, I went to Lantern Cafe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why I chose this place was because it was close to the Bryant Villa. I considered that it would be more convenient for her to come here at night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked for a booth and sent the booth number to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after I sat down, Laura appeared in front of me wearing a classic dress, a fringed shawl on her shoulders, and jewelry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She changed her hair style, curled her hair, and dyed it a popular color. Probably because I had facial treatment, my face looked much better than before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she sat in front of me, she looked very stylish and chipper..</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, I didn't look good today. I dressed casually today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, because of my dad's accident, I didn't care about dressing up at all, and I was not in the mood to dress up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw her, I stood up politely, smiled, and greeted her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked me to sit down and then sat in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Madeline, I heard in the afternoon that your dad was in a car accident. I don't know if it's true or not. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know where she heard that. However, in the upper-class circles of Hoswich, all kinds of rumors spread quickly. It was normal that she knew it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, my dad is out of danger after resuscitation, but he is still in the intensive care unit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told it truthfully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately covered her heart and looked very heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that sounds very serious. If I had known earlier, I would have gone to visit him. But it's great that he is safe now. Madeline, don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I know," I nodded and responded calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly feel that her attitude towards me was much more hypocritical than before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why she came to me tonight, but I was sure she was not here for my dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I expected, she said again at this time, "Madeline, actually I also know that your dad just had an accident, so I shouldn't look for you at this time. But, Cormac urged me hard. The doctor told me today, that Cormac can't eat or sleep well lately. If this continues, the condition will worsen faster!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately understood what she meant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just hoped that I could divorce Elliott quickly, so Elliott had enough time to find another woman to get married and have children, and then Cormac could have a great-grandson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know what you are thinking. I am already taking medicine. I will have a child with Elliott as soon as possible. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I thought of Giselle, I didn't want to get divorced even more, especially when Austin had a car accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I didn't divorce, I could at least use the Bryant family's influence to get more power in the Glory Group if the situation in the Glory Group didn't change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I divorced Elliott now, Jade might become more powerful. Compared to me, she was more familiar with Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to be on guard against her taking advantage of Austin's illness to do anything to seize the power of the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I didn't mention divorce, Laura became anxious, and her voice became a little higher.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should see a doctor a long time ago. You shouldn't have put it off until now. Dr. Louis said that your chances of getting pregnant now are very </span><span style="text-decoration: underline ;">small</span><span>. Elliott is our family's only son, Cormac's only wish is to have a great-grandson. You like Elliott so much, you don't want Elliott to regret it, right? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please give me and Elliott a little time. I know I'm not in good health, but I'll find a way to take care of it. If it doesn't work, we will do in vitro fertilization. I will work hard."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also raised my voice and said to Laura.</span></p></div>
