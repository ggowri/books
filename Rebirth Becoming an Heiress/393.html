        <h1>Chapter 393 Condescending</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle waddled over to me, her belly practically leading the way. With a condescending glance, she sized me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, I laid pinned to the ground by her hulking bodyguard, struggling to lift my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but notice her extravagant Chanel shoes and designer maternity dress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth could she afford such luxuries if not for Elliott's sneaky backing?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his denials of any involvement with Giselle, it was becoming increasingly clear that he thought I was as gullible as they come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank deeper with each passing moment. Just then, a commanding voice pierced through the tension in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the Bryant Group nonsense! Threatening the Mayers family with core components is laughable! And kicking Madeline out just because Giselle's expecting? That's reaching! Tell Laura to think twice before pulling a stunt like this again, unless the Bryants wanna bail on Hoswich for good!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right after the guy finished his rant, I felt the pressure on my shoulders ease up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I heard the bodyguard yelping in pain. Next thing I knew, someone strong hoisted me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a coat was snug around me. And there was Quinn, all suited up, standing tall by my side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, but he also brought in a bunch of muscle. They stormed into the room and formed a human barricade around us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quick as lightning, they taught Giselle's goons a lesson they wouldn't soon forget.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dashed over to my mom, helping her into a chair in a rush. Tears flooded her face, sheer terror etched across it. She was shaking like crazy, unable to utter a word, just crying her heart out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Mom, it's okay," I whispered, trying to calm her down in a soft tone. Meanwhile, I shot Giselle a look that could melt steel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was totally caught off guard by Quinn's arrival. She freaked out, eyeballing the squad of bodyguards filling the room. Clutching her mom's hand, she scrambled backward, shooting frantic looks at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the heck are you? What's with the tough talk?" she blurted out. Then it clicked. "Oh... you're that guy who was out partying with Madeline! I... I'm calling Elliott right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was about to dial Elliott's number when a frosty, commanding voice cut through the room from the doorway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's got the guts to move Austin?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Elliott, no mistaking that voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing him drop "Austin" and thinking back on the whole scene, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sarcasm.</span></p></div>
