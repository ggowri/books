        <h1>Chapter 217 Dinner at Giselle's Home</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, even the lowest discount price is still stressful for my family. My brother has spent all the money he has earned over the years, and my mother has only saved 300,000 dollars after working hard for so many years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was depressed when speaking of her poverty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but wonder if she used the same method to get that apartment from Elliott in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe things were not what I used to understand. Could it be that Elliott gave her the property out of compassion for her family rather than love for her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I was thinking quietly, Elliott said, "It doesn't matter. I can lend you the money that you lack first, and you don't have to pay it back in a hurry. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Elliott, you have helped my family a lot. You've paid my tuition fees and living expenses, as well as my mother's medical expenses over the years. How can we use your money to buy a house?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle waved her hands hurriedly and seemed to refuse Elliott's suggestion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I clearly felt that she was not that sincere. If she really didn't want Elliott's money, she wouldn't have told him how tough her family's financial situation was just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Elliott parked the car in front of Nicole's flower shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "Let's discuss this with your mother later. Come on, let's get off the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott jumped out of the car first, and Giselle and I followed. Then, we walked into the flower shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Nicole lived in a two-story building behind the flower shop, which looked old and mottled. However, the pots of flowers placed in the yard made it look quite beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole had already prepared many dishes. Seeing Elliott and I come in together, she was stunned for a moment but immediately put on a friendly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Elliott, Madeline comes with you. I've rarely seen you here. Come on, please take a seat. My house is shabby. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not, Nicole. I have always heard that your cooking skills are very good, so I'm honored to taste your dishes," I said politely with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you're here. Please have a seat. Giselle, entertain the guests first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole looked very enthusiastic and immediately went to prepare coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, Giselle, and I sat down around the small square dining table. I looked at the dishes on the table. Although the food materials were not expensive, every dish looked delicious and was delicately prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Giselle was very good at cooking in the last life. It seemed that she had learned it from her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle brought us knives and forks, and then let us start eating. Elliott picked up the fork first, put a piece of cucumber into his mouth, and tasted it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sat down next to Elliott. As she saw him only eating cucumber, she immediately talked to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, try my mother's roast beef. This is my mother's specialty dish."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded and brought a piece of roast beef to his mouth, but his hand shook accidentally, and the piece of beef fell and rolled off his suit. As a result, his suit was stained with sauce and grease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't move! I'll wipe the stain for you," Giselle exclaimed, hurried to pick up the tissue on the table, and carefully wiped the stains on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed that she deliberately got so close to him that she almost fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping the stains, she even grabbed his hands and began to wipe them carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing another woman wiping his clothes and hands in front of me without caring about my presence, I suddenly became extremely annoyed.</span></p></div>
