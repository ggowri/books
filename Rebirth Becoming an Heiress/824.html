        <h1>Chapter 824: I Gave Him My Answer</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bombarded me with a series of questions, his urgency palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had been waiting for my response for far too long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I initially planned to tell you after Elliott's recovery. But seeing you so upset just now, I decided to tell you ahead of time. I don't want you to keep worrying that my old feelings for Elliott might rekindle while I'm helping him get better."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that my smile was genuine when I was in front of Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn laughed too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a deep sigh. His previously tense expression gradually eased, replaced by a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This response came as a shock. But oh, what a delightful shock it was. Madeline, the moment I pushed open the hospital room door and saw you and Elliott sharing breakfast, so intimately, I thought I was about to lose you forever. But now, in the blink of an eye, you've given me such an incredible surprise&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, his face brimming with a grin. He attempted to open his arms for a hug, but he retracted them back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, he's afraid of being spotted by Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's always so kind, always putting others before himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at him, I wore a smile as radiant as a child's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done so much, so I can't always let you bear it all alone in silence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he treated me like a child, fondly patting my head. He then said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm willing to do anything for you, without a second thought. You don't need to feel guilty about anything. At first, I did suspect that Elliott was faking his amnesia. But after everything that happened last night, I know he's not pretending. So, you can stay by his side, help him recover without any worries. Once you've completely severed ties with him, we can start anew. Madeline, then we can take Noah and leave this country, escape from all of this, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I agree with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded in a hushed tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, I'm growing tired of this endless entanglement with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Might as well pack up and start a new life in a different country.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I truly wish for Noah's life to be simple and pure, devoid of unnecessary worries. I hope for him to have a childhood that's filled with joy and tranquility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I'm gradually setting the stage now. Once the three sectors of the Glory Group are on track, I won't need to be hands-on with everything. I'll just make decisions from behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll wait for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any further ado, and no need for extra words, Quinn simply responded to me like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this simple sentence brought a sense of liberation to both him and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't embrace, we simply high-fived heartily under the sun.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, I watched as Quinn drove off, until he gradually disappeared from my sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I returned to the room, Elliott had already changed into his own clothes, standing by his bed, waiting for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I walked in, his eyes were locked onto me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought, after you left this time, you wouldn't come back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone laid bare the bitterness within his heart to my sight.</span></p></div>
