        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered, "Has Elliott gone mad? Did he really come just to keep me company?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt as if my brain had exploded. Such </span><span>a thing</span><span> had seemed impossible in the past. But now, it was almost unbelievable to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can set aside my own affairs. After all, it's rare for me to take a break. In all these years, this is the first time," Elliott said as he looked into my eyes sincerely. At that moment, his eyes seemed to electrify, capturing my attention completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to admit, it was indeed difficult to refuse an invitation from such a handsome and perfect man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I actually already had everything planned out for the afternoon, but when I looked at Elliott's face, I just couldn't say no.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then instinctively said, "Well... Okay then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled with satisfaction upon hearing my response.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he smiled, it was as if an ancient glacier had suddenly melted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His features were relaxed, looking like nature reviving in spring, and I found myself mesmerized by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, my infatuation with Elliott was reignited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that when he unleashed his charm before me, I still couldn't resist him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, I felt indescribably frustrated. But by then, Elliott had already taken my hand and led me out of the conference room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, I have something to attend to this afternoon. I'll let you handle the rest," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Elliott </span><span>took </span><span>me away from the film set amidst Adam's once again shocked expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Elliott really was on vacation. He didn't even bring Toby along but drove his rarely used white Porsche to Louis City to find me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got into Elliott's car, and he quickly turned the car around, driving us away from the film set.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a habit of driving with one hand on the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott gripped the wheel, the watch on his wrist sparkled dazzlingly in the sunlight, making him look exceptionally dashing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the car, I couldn't help but steal a few glances at him. For some reason, my heart, which had been calm for so long, suddenly fluttered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like Elliott was unconsciously exuding his masculine charm today. Even the fragrance in his car seemed to carry a hint of romantic scent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear he had come prepared. With that realization, I immediately became more guarded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept telling myself, "Hang in there, Madeline. Don't be conquered by his charm. You have to be rational, absolutely rational."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Elliott drive straight ahead, I asked, "Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll know once we get there," he replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't tell me, but soon, he turned the steering wheel and headed toward the heart of Louis City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since arriving in Louis City, I had mostly been wandering between the film set and the hotel, and I hadn't had the chance to admire the beauty of this ancient city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I finally got to see the city's ancient buildings and beautiful urban landscape from the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott then drove along the street for about seven minutes before parking in front of a glass-fronted skyscraper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to look at me and signaled for me to get out. But I had no idea why he had brought me here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then cluelessly followed Elliott out of the car. Afterward, he immediately took my hand and led me into the building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit nervous, I couldn't help but ask again, "What exactly are we doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott just continued to smile and didn't respond. After </span><span>taking </span><span>me into the elevator, he pressed the button for the top floor of the building.</span></p></div>
