        <h1>Chapter 192 Dinner Gathering</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving in Louis City with Adam, we temporarily checked in at the hotel contracted by the film crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan invited us to have a meal at a bustling department store center in Louis City. Shortly after we had settled our luggage, we set off by car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late autumn, and the weather in Louis City was a bit chilly. I deliberately changed into a milk tea brown windbreaker to cover up the hickey on my neck. I paired it with a light-colored scarf to cover it up. For the bottom, I wore a slim-fit cropped jeans and a pair of white low-heeled shoes. I casually tied my hair into a ponytail at the back of my head and put on light makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adam and I arrived at the restaurant, Rowan was already waiting for us in the corner on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they met again, Rowan had completely transformed from his previous desolate state. His hair was neatly styled, his sideburns were sharp, and he was dressed in a black suit with a tie. He also had a badge pinned to his chest, which bore the name of a law firm. He appeared radiant and exuded the aura of a lawyer, a stark contrast to the young man who used to work as a real estate agent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, kid, you look handsome in this work uniform," Adam couldn't help but tease Rowan as soon as he saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood in place, watching Rowan politely smile. Then, I reached out my hand towards him and said, "Rowan, hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, hello hello, please have a seat." Rowan, looking somewhat awkward, quickly extended his hand and shook mine, pointing to the seat across from him, indicating for me to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam and Rowan sat together, while I sat alone across from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the young man, Adam, sat down, he started joking around with Rowan. They exchanged a few teasing remarks and then Rowan gestured for me to order first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to not eat at this restaurant very often, and I had never tried their spicy dishes before. However, upon Adam's strong recommendation, we ordered some spicy dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, the three of us started chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I really appreciate you recommending me to Mr. Knight's law firm. He has been very kind to me, and I have now started assisting him with some small cases. My parents said that when they have the chance to come to Hoswich, they will definitely thank you in person." Rowan said gratefully as he picked up a glass of draft beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fair skin and delicate features. He looked very elegant overall. In terms of appearance, he was actually a perfect match for Giselle. If he were placed on campus, he would definitely be the kind of campus celebrity that many girls would be infatuated with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he looked at me with sincere eyes, and he sat with Adam. The vitality and energy that young people possess were also contagious, making me feel young again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the beer in front of me and clinked glasses with him. I said, "It's nothing, my help is no big deal. I treat Adam like a brother, and you are his friend, also my brother. If you need any help, just let me know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you. In the future, if you need anything from us, feel free to ask," Rowan said excitedly as he stood up and downed a whole glass of beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his sincere actions, I was amused and reluctantly drank half of it. However, the beer was too filling for my stomach, and I truly couldn't finish the whole glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam immediately started making a fuss, insisting on drinking with me. Finally, the three of us started playing a guessing game, where the person who guessed wrong had to drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, under their influence, that evening, I tried spicy food that I had never tried before, and also tried a series of heavily flavored dishes. Finally, I was even forced to drink several large glasses of draught beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I also felt a long-lost joy that could only be found during my college days.</span></p></div>
