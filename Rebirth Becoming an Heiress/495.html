        <h1>Chapter 495 Oscar Awards Ceremony</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had expected that there would be a need for a lot of masks, protective clothing, and other disinfection items, so Glory Group had a lot of inventory in its warehouse. Therefore, we almost never refused suppliers who came to us. As long as they agreed to sign the contract with us, we would give them the stocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a significant shortage of medical items on the market, and other businesses began to increase their prices. However, I still stuck to the original price because I didn't want to make such unethical money. I just wanted to do my best to help the needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the pandemic, my work increased, and I became busy. Hospitals were overcrowded. Besides, after Fiona entered Alaska, she was isolated at the isolation center and wouldn't be back in the short term. Therefore, I hadn't gone to the hospital in time for a follow-up checkup, so I had no idea how the baby in my belly was doing now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I believed in Marcus' medical skills, and I took the tonics he made for me every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, day after day, my belly began to bulge slightly. Due to the pandemic, the original annual drama festival that was held in October was directly brought forward to the day of the Carnival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam received the news of the rescheduling, came to my office, and asked me, "Madeline, the Oscars award ceremony has been rescheduled to the Carnival, but the pandemic is still serious and you are pregnant, will you still attend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally planned to go to Tepit with Rowan, but he was infected with the virus before leaving, so he could only cancel the trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I have been infected once, and I have immune. Besides, our medicine is very effective against the virus. Even if we are infected, there's no need to be afraid. We have to have confidence in the medicine we have developed," I said with certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, even so, you still have to be careful. You should still wear a mask on the day of the award ceremony," Adam reminded. At the same time, he put a bowl of tonic that he had stewed on my table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the outbreak, Adam brought the pot for stewing from his home to the company. He would stew various kinds of tonic for me every day, although I was still nauseous and couldn't eat many things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he would take good care of the baby in my belly and ensure that the baby had enough nutrients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was moved again and again by the delicacy and thoughtfulness of that cheerful man, so I accepted his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flies. Soon, it was the Carnival day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to cover up my slightly bulging belly, I deliberately chose a looser, long black gown. I wore light makeup and a mask to the ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the ceremony was allowed to be held, due to the impact of the pandemic, the number of people in the venue was limited. The initially grand ceremony looked much more deserted than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked to the entrance and took out the invitation. The greeter quickly welcomed me to the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the popularity of the show Do Not Love, my seat was arranged in the second row of the hall by the organizer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just after I sat down, I suddenly discovered that the name of the seat on my right side was Elliott Bryant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I saw that name again, I was stunned. As if I was electrocuted, I jumped up from my seat.</span></p></div>
