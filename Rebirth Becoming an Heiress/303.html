        <h1>Chapter 303 Righteousness</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, my dad is an experienced driver who has been driving for years. And he's always been very careful with his driving, he even has very few violation records. That road is the one my dad has always driven, so it's logical that he couldn't have had such an accident. Quinn, what do the police say now? Has the driver still not been caught?" I asked in a rush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Austin's accident, I had entrusted Quinn with the investigation of Austin's accident. And subconsciously, I had come to think of him as a trusted friend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Quinn did try his best. He had been in contact with the police and had been busy with my family as if it were his own business.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At present, the driver has not been found. The owner of the truck has been found, but he stated that the truck he had foreclosed on to the mortgage company a few months ago. The mortgage company also rented the car to someone else. The truck driver is from Hoswich, but the police contacted his family and found out that he has not returned home for many years," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the driver's identity so unusual? I'm getting the feeling that it's a conspiracy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel uneasy in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about whether or not your dad has some kind of arch-enemy, or if someone is trying to do something to your family in secret. If you need my help, you can always find me. You don't have to face these things alone, okay?" Quinn said into the phone again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I probably know what's going on. I don't have enough proof right now though. Quinn, thanks for being willing to do me a favor."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt more and more that the whole thing had something to do with Jade and Tom. However, I didn't have the evidence right now, so I didn't say it outright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to thank me. It's late, so get an early night and don't push yourself. If you need me to come over to keep you company, I'm fine. I'm a bachelor anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was really righteous. Not only was he so helpful, but he was also so serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you should get some rest. You've been busy all day today because of my family. I really appreciate it," I hurriedly said into the phone. And just at that moment, in the corridor, there suddenly came a dull sound of footsteps.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps were extraordinarily familiar to me. I couldn't help but follow the sound and look towards that side. To my surprise, Elliott appeared in the corridor. He was alone, with a bag of stuff in his hand, and was walking towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to come over this late at night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up in a panic. And by that time, Elliott had walked up to me. He looked at me fixedly, then whispered, "I knew it, you must be guarding this place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask, mentally surprised, "What are you doing here so late?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't answer my words but watched through the glass for a moment. He looked at Austin, who was still lying down and then raised something he was carrying in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're hungry, aren't you? I brought burgers, fried chicken, Coke and a box of fruit."</span></p></div>
