        <h1>Chapter 863: Bearing Three Children</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not hearing things, am I?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This couple, who wouldn't even spare me a measly 0.1% of their shares before, are now surprisingly willing to offer me a whole 10%.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much I deny it, no matter how much I stress that Noah shares no blood ties with them, they still firmly believe that Noah is Elliott's child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, why would they be willing to give me such a large share?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a cold chuckle. These shares, perhaps they would have tempted me in the past. But now, Glory Group is in its prime, its market value might not be far off from Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, being the only child of my parents, everything that Glory Group owns is mine. I don't have to compete with anyone for it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ten percent stake, I'm not particularly fond of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Noah, he's the third generation of the Glory Group, the heir to our Mayers family. He doesn't need their charity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? For free?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a cold laugh, then asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper gave a slight shake of his head, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, there's a catch. You have to agree to be with Elliott and have at least three kids."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew they couldn't possibly be that generous, handing me a ten percent stake with no strings attached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three kids... If it's about loving a man, building a family with him, maybe I could consider having three.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it's just for the sake of money, sorry, I'm not a baby-making machine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the freshly squeezed corn juice from the table, took a gentle sip, and said coldly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten percent of Bryant Group's shares, the annual dividends are just a few tens of millions. Sorry, I don't need it. I'm currently focused on my career, not considering having children for now. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave. Enjoy your meal."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said all that, I wiped my mouth, rose to my feet, and prepared to take my leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, having kids is a decision for Madeline and me to make, not for you to plan when and how many. I'm full now, you guys take your time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was about to leave, Elliott rose to his feet, intending to depart with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was instantly flustered, hastily grabbing my hand, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come with me to my bedroom, I've got something to show you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was clueless, but I had no choice but to follow her into her bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reaching her bedroom, she immediately bolted the door shut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Elliott gone, there was no need for her to keep up the act. She looked at me, and said bluntly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already apologized, what more do you want before you let us see the child? If the child truly isn't a Bryant, then I'll let it go. But your insistence on keeping me from seeing the child only proves that it must be Elliott's. Why else would you stop me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it, all this drama they've staged, it all boils down to one thing - Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you do, no matter what you say, there's no way I'm letting you see the kid. So, you might as well give up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly. After finishing, I turned around, ready to pull open the door and leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, a heavy "thud" suddenly echoed from behind...</span></p></div>
