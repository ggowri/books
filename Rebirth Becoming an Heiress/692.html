        <h1>Chapter 692 I Don't Care at All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a delicate box in the bag, like jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened that box. When I saw that gift, I froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that Elliott had purchased a pair of handmade wedding rings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, I had mentioned these rings in my diary before. The pattern on the ring was my all-time favorite primrose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this pair of rings was handcrafted by a designer whom I really admire. The rings have a simple and elegant design, not like those trendy ones. They are unique because this designer only makes one pair of rings, regardless of the style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because of this that the shop had couples lining up every day to make reservations for rings. After all, in this restless era, people still long for everlasting love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had forgotten when I mentioned this pair of rings in my diary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many times did Elliott read my diary to remember these little details by heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The designer opened the shop on the ancient street of Hoswich city, and the shop was also very small. Men like Elliott, who always only loved limited edition luxury brands, would probably look down on such a shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he actually stood in line there for a whole day. Moreover, he even custom-made a pair of couple rings based on the ring style I had imagined in my diary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to him now? After so many years, does he finally understand what love is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, how could he have possibly taken an interest in these things? Not to mention making them himself, even if he collaborated with me, he felt it would be a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at this pair of rings in the box, remained silent for a long time, and didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor, the new driver, said again at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Bryant endured a day of rain in order to reserve this gift. It happened to be pouring that day, and I offered to stand in line for him, but he refused. As a result, when he returned home, he developed a high fever and struggled with it for a week before finally starting to feel a little better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Trevor really talked a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his words shocked me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sounds like the infatuated male protagonist in a romantic novel. How could he be the man I once admired?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can't believe it, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why do I feel like he was making up stories? Could he be deliberately trying to help Elliott gain my sympathy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it. He couldn't have done such a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded disdainfully. Despite being somewhat shocked, I pretended not to care. After closing the box, I simply threw it aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did not lie. I still had the photo of Mr. Bryant queuing in my phone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, seeing that I didn't believe him, directly took out his phone from his pocket and showed me the photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a glance and immediately noticed the tall figure among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo was taken casually and is a bit blurry, but it is precisely this blur that gives this photo a certain artistic charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ancient street, the sky was gloomy and it was raining. Many couples were holding umbrellas, leaning against each other and queuing up, only he stood alone in the middle of the line, braving the rain in solitude. That straight figure looked so determined and resolute, resembling someone who was ready to fight fiercely for love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't expect it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be something Elliott did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that the Bryant family's recent performance has declined. Were they too idle and had nothing to do to do so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked as I was, I couldn't help but make a sarcastic comment, not wanting to make a big deal out of such a trivial matter.</span></p></div>
