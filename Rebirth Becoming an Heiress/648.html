        <h1>Chapter 648 Deliberately Provoked Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My phone screen was very bright. Elliott must have seen the word "Quinn" displayed on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the phone and pretended to be affectionate as I said, "Hello, darling, what's up? Why are you calling me so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Elliott was very upset. But it didn't matter, so I made him even more upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott used to receive calls from other women in front of me, and even intentionally flirted with other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was my turn to provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling? I know you're happy, but do you have to be this happy? Is everything done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yup. Where shall I celebrate?" I smiled, with a playful tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was still standing by the window, motionless. I glanced up and saw that his expression was very serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you can come to my club. Do you want me to pick you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's tone also involuntarily rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll drive there. Just wait for me over there, see you later, love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be coquettish on the phone and then hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the car, Elliott stood like a statue. However, I noticed that his fists were clenched tightly, as if he was holding back a rage that had nowhere to be released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you going to meet Quinn now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice became cold and increasingly low and hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we were getting married soon, you should have wished us well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately provoked Elliott by saying things he didn't want to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed provoked, and then he bent down to stick his head in. Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed my chin, revealing a fierce expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wish? How can you say such words? Do you really not care about my feelings at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had expressed it so clearly, but I didn't expect Elliott to still be so persistent in wanting to verify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard for people to accept that the person who loved them didn't love them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reluctantly untangled his hand and glanced at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I have answered this question too many times in the past, and this is the last time. Listen carefully. I didn't care about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke decisively and didn't care about his feelings at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This also made me feel a sense of indifference, which was surprisingly refreshing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I did so much for him. I put in so much effort, yet Elliott hurt me with the sharpest words, tearing apart all of my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had the same indifferent attitude as I do now, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt so good when I didn't care about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bent over, staring at my face, his sharp gaze like that of a cheetah, as if he wanted to tear me apart at any moment, making me instantly feel a little scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively tilted my head backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I was afraid that Elliott would suddenly attack me and force me like before... Luckily, he didn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly laughed, as if he had figured out a lot of things and moved on. He self-mockingly said, "It seems that I was too arrogant and sentimental. Madeline, I understand now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, Elliott had already turned around and quickly walked towards the direction of the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched his tall figure until it disappeared.</span></p></div>
