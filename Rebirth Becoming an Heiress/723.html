        <h1>Chapter 723 Familiar Stranger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I know," I replied nonchalantly, but couldn't help feeling a bit surprised in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that, when I left so cruelly last time, I didn't take his confession seriously at all, so he should be very angry with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this conversation, I didn't feel anything, except that his tone was clearly less urgent than the previous few times. On the contrary, there was a faint sense of detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plane took off quickly. We all fastened our seat belts. Throughout the whole process, he and I did not communicate or interact anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put on the eye mask and felt a bit uncomfortable due to the turbulence during the ascent of the plane. Subconsciously, I grabbed onto the armrests on both sides, trying hard to overcome this physical discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when the plane collided with the turbulent cloud layer, I couldn't help but let out a dry heave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, a warm hand suddenly grabbed my wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How, are you feeling unwell?" Elliott asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that Elliott had caught hold of my wrist, I quickly pulled away. I felt his fingers stiffen for a moment, but upon seeing my refusal, he did not insist and instead withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to guard against me like a wolf, Madeline," his words carried a faint sense of sadness, sounding particularly hoarse in this enclosed cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it wasn't a deliberate coincidence, let's treat each other as chance encounter </span><span>passengers. We were already familiar strangers, so let's refrain from any physical contact to avoid any discomfort between us," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This flight was expected to take two and a half hours, but encountering Elliott made me feel like those two and a half hours suddenly became endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to avoid bringing up those topics about emotions between us again, I took the initiative to state my position and said these words upfront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Familiar stranger... Your choice of words has become increasingly sharp," I said, clearly hitting a nerve with Elliott. Elliott chuckled self-deprecatingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't respond because I didn't want to continue the conversation with him on this topic. So, I simply put on an eye mask, covered myself with a blanket, and pretended to be uninterested in talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott waited for a while, seeing that I had no reaction, so he sighed softly. Soon, I heard the sound of him flipping through a magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plane finally smoothly ascended into the high sky, and the discomfort in my stomach instantly eased. Another wave of sleepiness came over me, and I fell asleep in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know how long it had been when a phone ring woke me up from my dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard Elliott pick up the phone, not knowing what the person on the other end said. I heard his voice suddenly become alert. "You mean, I've been targeted?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I got it," Elliott hung up the phone. In the darkness, I heard a rustling sound coming from his end, as if he was searching for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't think much about it, and I fell into a drowsy sleep. However, just as I was about to enter deep sleep, I suddenly felt as if someone had approached me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly felt a familiar scent gradually approaching me, and then, a hand suddenly reached over me, as if groping for something in the darkness... accompanied by an extremely strong sense of oppression and an inexplicable fear, instantly waking me up from my sleep!</span></p></div>
