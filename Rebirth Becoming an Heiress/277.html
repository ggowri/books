        <h1>Chapter 277 It Was Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire crowd was left stunned by his gesture, erupting into excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lively rendition of the birthday song quickly filled the air. Before I could react, someone placed a birthday crown on my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd joined in singing the song together. I stood on stage, overwhelmed by the immense surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, my face was hidden behind a mask. My makeup was probably ruined by the tears, making me look terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn appeared beside me out of nowhere. Seeing me frozen, he leaned in and whispered softly, "Didn't you say he never celebrated your birthday? Today, he's making up for it. Cheer up and make a wish, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words finally gave me the courage to confirm that the man before me was undoubtedly Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still wore a mask, so I couldn't see his expression. His body was draped in a large black robe, clearly to conceal his identity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he often appeared in major financial news and magazines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, he had never celebrated my birthday before. Over the years, he didn't even know when my birthday was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I never imagined that after not contacting each other for half a month, he would suddenly appear in Louis City today, singing my favorite song and organizing this birthday party for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This didn't seem like his style at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in my eyes once again, my face betraying a bewildered expression under the mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me still standing there in a daze, Quinn reminded me to make a wish. That snapped me out of my reverie, and amidst everyone's gaze, I made a random wish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blew out the candles, cut the cake, and finally, the birthday celebration came to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Quinn's cue, the entire party once again plunged into revelry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained rooted to the spot as Mr. S approached me. He took my hand and led me through the dimly lit space amidst the crowd. We left the venue and went to a dim and empty corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if longing to see each other, we removed each other's masks almost simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I saw his face clearly, an overwhelming impulse led me to tiptoe and wrap my arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His urgency matched mine. He held me tightly by the waist, pressing me against the wall without a word, and kissed my lips fervently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need for any unnecessary words. We poured out all of our suppressed emotions and began kissing passionately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held me so tightly and was reluctant to let go. Even through his black robe, I could still feel his strong heartbeat through his broad chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of tonight's enormous surprise, I seemed to have turned into a puddle of mush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held my waist and cradled my head. I clung to him, not wanting to let go for even a second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We kissed for a long time, and were finally willing to stop when we were almost suffocated from the kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I buried my head deeply in his chest. He seemed to feel my attachment to him, holding me tightly and then chuckling lightly as he said, "Silly girl, if you miss me so much, why didn't you give me a call?"</span></p></div>
