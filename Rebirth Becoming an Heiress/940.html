        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously tried to block it, but my eyes closed and even my eyelashes began to flutter uneasily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that my reason was reminding me to stay away from him, but my body seemed to hate being glued to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling mortified me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand rubbed at the concealed clasp of my underwear, but he was in no hurry to rip it open; he floated it in small, deliberate motions, causing a constant, faint itch to flood my back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips still didn't leave mine, and the scent of testosterone traveled strongly down my nostrils and into my brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My entire soul seemed to float away, this long</span><span>-</span><span>lost feeling set every cell in my body on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he suddenly unclasped the secret button of my underwear with force </span><span>......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, my body stirred up a longing I had never felt before, and I longed for his swift advance, for his ultimate touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet </span><span>......</span><span>Elliott stopped abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled his hands and lips away from my body at the same time, and he took a deep breath before sitting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My entire body had a momentary sense of loss as I was drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously tugged at the corner of the covers and opened my eyes to see him sitting shirtless, revealing his athletic and powerful back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was still well</span><span>-</span><span>maintained, with beautifully muscled arms and an extremely toned back, and his skin looked extraordinarily inviting as it glowed a bronze color in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him in a daze and heard him speak softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Can't go on, if this continues, I'm going to commit a crime.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he was desperately restraining himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body at this time has been teased by him to the point of hunger and thirst, like lying in the desert desperately in need of a mouthful of spring water, and there is a person in my body who does not know where to drill out and shout furiously:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on, sin quickly, it's okay </span><span>......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled by this sudden voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>......</span><span> How could I have thought that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is too nasty of me, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that what Fiona said, that after a woman gives birth to a child, her needs in that area will increase is true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole face was covered in clouds in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, didn't know about my mental activities at this moment, he turned around after calming down a little, thoughtfully covered me tightly with the quilt, and then softly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You go to sleep first, I'm going to take a shower. When you're sound asleep, I'll come back and hold you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he got up and went to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at his back, a great loss actually welled up in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he was far away, the desire within my body slowly receded like a tidal wave, and sanity gradually returned to my brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gradually let myself calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was probably too tired, and after a night of tossing and turning coupled with the fact that my body hadn't healed, I quickly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know exactly when Elliott returned to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only vaguely felt a sudden gust of wind under the covers, followed by a cool body approaching me, an arm gently encircling my waist, and then I heard the powerful sound of my heart beating from behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instincts stirred in my body couldn't resist the intense drowsiness, and it wasn't long before I was once again sleeping peacefully in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up again, it was around noon the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I woke up with a fresh set of clothes in front of my bed, along with what looked like a cold breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to be up early, he was sitting on the couch not far from the bed in a shirt sipping his coffee and looking at his laptop, he seemed to be taking care of some official business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also seemed to have gotten a haircut in the morning, his sideburns were trimmed in an extraordinarily shapely manner, making his entire body not only look refreshed, but his handsomeness increased again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing me make a sound, he immediately put down the work at hand, ran towards me, and subconsciously reached out to probe my forehead:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mike's medical skills are still fine, you don't have another fever. Do the soles of your feet still hurt? If it hurts, you'll eat your meal and take a pill later.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It doesn't hurt anymore, I can't feel it anymore.</span><span>"</span><span> I shook my head and said with a quick smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was relieved to hear that:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That's good, Mike said the medicine works well and recovers quickly, so it looks like he didn't lie to me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He's your college alumni, how could he possibly lie to you?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words made me laugh and I couldn't help but say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That's because you don't know, he used to lie to me a lot when we were roommates. Because I didn't know anything about medicine, once I had diarrhea, he purposely gave me vitamin tablets, he said they were anti</span><span>-</span><span>diarrhea, but I ended up taking them thinking they were fine and went on stage to give a speech. Which I know the speech played in the middle of the speech, I suddenly realized that something is not right </span><span>......"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said here, he suddenly realized that this paragraph is very ruined image, he did not go on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I couldn't help but laugh, I didn't realize there was such a comical side between the two of them, and I couldn't help but ask him curiously:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And then what? You didn't shit in your pants, did you? In front of all those people?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly turned red with embarrassment:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course I didn't, of course I was trying desperately to restrain myself, it's just that because I was restraining myself, my entire face was tense, causing everyone to think I was in a bad mood. He lied to me more than once, he looks jaded, but he's actually worse than even Philip.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speech in a bad mood photo </span><span>......</span><span> When he said that, I instantly had a memory in my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was studying abroad for that period of time, I was in China at that time, because I couldn't see him, I bribed someone to take his photo for me and send it to me, one of which was him tensing his face with a very unhappy look during the speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't realize that there was such a funny bridge behind that photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his mentioning of Philip also made me feel a little surprised in my heart at once, and I asked him in a hurry:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Speaking of Philip, is he related to this Korean classmate of yours? How come the two have similar names?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mike is Philip's half</span><span>-</span><span>brother, Mike's mother is Korean, and when she broke up with his dad back then, she brought Mike to Korea, so Mike grew up in Korea, but is actually Chinese. Only his mom doesn't want him to recognize his relatives, so, there is no connection between him and Philip. If you look closely you'll see that the two of them look a little bit alike.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on me that there was such a kink in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and just then Elliott's phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but stare slightly after seeing the name displayed on the phone, and then, he picked up the phone in front of me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hello, who is it?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, it's me, it's Lisa. i haven't been able to reach you for the last few days, and when i went to your office you weren't there, where have you been?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phone had an outside voice, I was close enough to clearly hear Lisa's gentle voice, coming out of the phone.</span></p></div>
