        <h1>Chapter 538 Unexpected</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Jessica, overwhelmed, not knowing what to say, to the extent that I forgot to reach out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents knew you were coming today and couldn't figure out what you like to eat, so they bought a lot of fruits and groceries. Feel free to help yourself. There's no need for formality at my home." Quinn gestured towards the fruits on the coffee table, smiling warmly at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I snap out of it, quickly grabbing two cherries from the fruit platter and saying to Jessica, "Jessica, you're too kind. Your hospitality makes me feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for my embarrassment was partly due to shyness, but also because I felt undeserving of their kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were treating me so well. Perhaps they mistakenly thought Quinn was the father of my child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was serious. When I thought about the future, I became even more nervous, unsure of how things would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be embarrassed. You're Quinn's girlfriend, so naturally, we consider you family. We've heard about you and the Bryant family. You don't have to worry. Society is very open-minded now. As long as Quinn likes you, we have no objections," Jessica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Alexander and Jessica were unaware of my past with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to my surprise, Jessica brought it up directly, reassuring me not to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was astonished, looking at her with disbelief at her kind demeanor. I couldn't imagine what kind of woman she was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing about my history with Elliott, yet not minding my relationship with Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had their mindset become so open-minded?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely dumbfounded, even more uncertain about what to say. Just then, Carole's voice floated over from behind us. "Madeline, you're here. My parents have known about you and Quinn since yesterday, and they've been clamoring to meet you. I hope they haven't startled you by being too quick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Carole finished speaking, she was already beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because she was at home, she wasn't wearing makeup, with a headband tied around her head, dressed in a white silk pajama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the natural look, she was still beautiful, and her skin was surprisingly fair, glowing against the white silk pajamas, incredibly radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, Alexander and Jessica are very kind, and your whole family is very kind," I hastily replied with courtesy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents found out about this yesterday and scolded Quinn harshly, blaming him for being too impulsive. After dinner, my mom and I will accompany you to the hospital for a check-up. You've been in Carthage for so long. Haven't you had any check-ups? It's all because of this rascal, not even telling me!" Carole said, patting Quinn's shoulder vigorously, causing him to flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn winced, shooting Carole a glare. "I didn't tell you to avoid shocking you, making it public knowledge. This is between Madeline and me. We'll handle it ourselves. You don't need to worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just a matter between you and Madeline. Pregnancy is a big deal that can't be taken lightly! Carole is right. This afternoon, I'll go with her for the check-up! You clueless boy, you just know nothing!" Jessica chimed in, glaring at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you don't have to join in, okay? If someone has to accompany her, it'll be me, and you two don't need to come." Quinn tried hard to refuse on my behalf, knowing my concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, even Alexander didn't support him. Instead, he said, "You clueless boy, you know nothing. Let your mom and Carole accompany her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I understood why Carole could be so bold in front of Quinn.</span></p></div>
