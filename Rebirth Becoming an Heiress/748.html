        <h1>Chapter 748 Rescued</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it my illusion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment that man got off the motorcycle and took off his helmet, I felt like I saw Elliott's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could see his face, he had already run toward this direction and then directly engaged in a fight with Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was tall and despite Jade having been exercising for the past two years, she still couldn't match him. Soon, he grabbed her arm and forcefully pressed her face against a tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let your people release them! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's magnetic voice resounded, his firm tone and extremely penetrating voice indicating that he was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men who were holding me let go of me quickly, and I was once again thrown to the ground by them. At this moment, a surge of intense pain in my abdomen hit me, causing me to contort in agony. I couldn't bear the severe pain any longer, and I immediately passed out from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The labor pains grew stronger with each passing moment, and I was in extreme pain to the point where I couldn't see clearly what was in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I seemed to hear the roar of cars, as if a helicopter was hovering above my head. I felt like I was being lifted up from the ground by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was bleeding a lot! Hurry, find a way to save her! We must ensure that both she and the child are okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I heard the man holding me desperately shouting. I really wanted to open my eyes and see his face, but I was already in so much pain that I didn't even have the strength to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body was constantly bouncing like on a swing, and that man seemed to be holding me tightly as we ran desperately. Soon, I felt like I was placed in a car, and then, two strong beams of light above my head made it impossible for me to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I fell into a deep coma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how long I had been struggling, but when I opened my eyes again, I found myself facing not the desolate mountains and forests, but white walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pungent smell of disinfectant and the cold instruments around me made me realize that I was in a hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively moved my hand, only to find that there seemed to be a needle inserted on my finger. My body also seemed to be filled with instruments, and there was no one around me, only many instruments occasionally emitting piercing dripping sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know where I was, I only felt that my body and eyelids were very heavy. I wanted to wake myself up, but I couldn't wake up all the time. In the end, I fell into a coma again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I regained consciousness once again, I found myself in a clean and refreshing hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I opened my eyes, I felt someone tightly holding my hand. The warmth of his palm made me unable to resist moving my fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I heard Quinn's gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you finally woke up! That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up in his direction. Quinn was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a light blue shirt and black pants. His face looked haggard, with a beard covering it, and his eyes were bloodshot. It was evident that he hadn't had a proper rest for many days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the smile on his face at that moment indicated that he was truly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, where was I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked softly, and I realized that my voice still sounded weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At Hoswich City People's Hospital, Madeline. Don't worry. You and the baby are both safe. The baby is now in an incubator, with good vital signs. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn tightly held my hand, knowing what I was most worried about, so he immediately said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoswich city People's Hospital?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was immediately confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I get rescued?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brought me back from Norch City to Hoswich City, and did I also successfully give birth to my baby?</span></p></div>
