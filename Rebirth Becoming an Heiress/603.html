        <h1>Chapter 603 Stop Them</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Philip to be standing on the roadside with Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel desperately threw herself into Philip's arms. Philip tried to break free, but her two arms tightly clung to his neck. While Philip was speaking, Quinn, who was standing beside him, also tried to persuade her. However, Jezebel didn't stop. Instead, she held Philip even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which woman could remain rational when she saw her husband with another woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being stunned for a moment, Paige suddenly burst into hysterical crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed toward Philip and shouted, "You are so shameless! How dare you cling to each other in public? Jezebel, do you know that he is already married? You bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige ran over and pulled Jezebel off Philip without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was petite. I had no idea before she had such great strength. Not only did she pull Jezebel down, but she also pinned Jezebel to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had lost her sanity. She saw Jezebel as an enemy and quickly sat on top of her. Then she started slapping Jezebel across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was very angry, and each slap was loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Jezebel didn't know what had happened. When she came to her senses and realized Paige was slapping her, she started fighting back, repeatedly hitting Paige in the belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene terrified me. I instinctively rushed forward, wanting to separate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quinn stood in front of me and signaled with her eyes for me not to approach them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he shouted at Philip, "Philip, what are you doing? Why don't you stop them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's roar snapped Philip out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly stepped forward and pulled Jezebel away from Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he held onto Paige's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip asked with concern, "Paige, are you okay? Did you get hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige slapped Philip hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled uncontrollably and shouted at Philip, "Don't touch me. I don't feel well. You even accepted a woman like her. You're so disgusting, Philip!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she couldn't help but cover her face and cry sadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her, I was also sad and wanted to walk over. At that time, Jezebel stood up from the ground. When Paige didn't notice her, Jezebel suddenly took off one of her high heels and fiercely threw it on Paige's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the crimson flashed before me, I quickly yelled, "Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I shouted, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high heel smashed into Paige's belly. Paige was caught off guard and let out a painful groan. The high heel was sharp, and Jezebel had thrown it hard. After hitting Paige's belly, the shoe fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing what just happened, Quinn and I shouted in unison and hurriedly rushed forward to support Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige was already in so much pain that she couldn't stand straight. She broke out in a cold sweat. Then, I saw blood running down from under her dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events made my head buzz. I hurriedly cried out at Philip, "Philip, </span><span>don't stand there. Call an ambulance."</span></p></div>
