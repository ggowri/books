        <h1>Chapter 364 He Is on My Side</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper didn't expect Elliott would act like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled over his words, trying to explain, "It's... It's about the future of this family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about it? Just spit it out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone remained indifferent, his gaze unyielding as he faced his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about you and Madeline! It's been six months already. Madeline, are you pregnant yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac's question was sharp, and the tapping of his cane on the ground echoed his frustration. His eyes bore into me, waiting for an answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew this interrogation was coming. They had gathered us here for this exact reason.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not pregnant yet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted reluctantly. His attitude and question disgusted me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac's cane struck the ground again as he let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's not that I blame you. Elliott is now thirty years old. His cousins back in Brila at his age all have several children. Yet here you two are, still childless after all this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura took over, her voice heavy with disappointment. "Your grandfather longs to hold his great-grandson. I've been trying to help you conceive for the past two years, Madeline. But why didn't you tell us sooner if you couldn't have children? Even if your family offered us two billion dollars, we wouldn't have accepted it if we'd known about your condition."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura stamped her feet as if my inability to have a child made them sad and regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat there, feeling small and exposed under their scrutiny. It was like being interrogated in a police station, every word a blow to my pride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to speak, Elliott squeezed my hand and spoke up, "Madeline and I plan to undergo fertility treatments next spring. We will have our kids."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His announcement stunned them off guard as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense! What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "Are test tube babies the same as naturally conceived children?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Louis already told us that it is difficult for Madeline to carry a baby no matter what method you try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura chimed in, echoing Cormac's disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper added directly, "Your time limit has expired. I don't want you to waste any more time. Let's get on with it while you're still young, Madeline. If you have any requirements, why not lay them out tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cut like a knife, dredging up feelings of humiliation and injustice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It reminded me of my previous life, when I faced similar pressure from them, ultimately leading to my divorce from Elliott and enduring their scorn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, yes, I have experienced this before," I thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, their attitudes were even worse and more disgusting than they are now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bit my lip, feeling the weight of their humiliation bearing down on me once again.</span></p></div>
