        <h1>Chapter 18 Heiress</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After daybreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked out a white professional suit from the wardrobe. After changing my clothes, I applied light makeup in front of the mirror and tied my hair up into a high bun. Then, I put on the pearl earrings that my mother had given me before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never tried such a commercial dress before, and this professional suit was recently purchased on purpose. However, after dressing up and looking at my brisk and elegant appearance in the mirror, I suddenly gained a little more confidence in myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I carried my limited-edition bag downstairs. When my mom saw me, she smiled brightly in that instant, and my dad's gaze was also satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never cared about what I wore, but for the first time, he complimented me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline looks like a successor to Glory Group in this suit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too early to praise her. You know she might not be able to hold on for a few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to start things with great enthusiasm but often failed to follow through, so even my mom was unsure how long my determination could last this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't underestimate me. I have my father's genes. Maybe I can turn Glory Group into a commercial empire in Hoswich City and even the whole world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents were immediately amused by my words. My mom had already prepared breakfast, and she urged me and my dad to sit down and eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having breakfast with my parents, I drove to Glory Group with my dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we arrived at Glory Group, from a distance, I saw Jade standing at the entrance of the building in professional attire, waiting for our arrival with great respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was dressed in a black business suit today, with long tassel diamond earrings shining brightly. She had red lips and a powerful aura, clearly indicating that she came prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guessed she wanted to defeat me, a young and inexperienced true heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, today I was also fully prepared. I even specially bought a pair of champagne-colored high heels that matched my professional attire. The lipstick I used was the most authentic red. It was not as flamboyant as hers, but powerful enough. And my facial features were graceful and well-defined, resembling my father's. In terms of clothing and appearance, I believed that I was not inferior to Jade in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade still treated me as a playful little girl, so she was very shocked to see me dressed like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As usual, she came over and affectionately wrapped her arm around mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you dressed so professionally today? It really surprised me. I thought you were just coming over to have fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should dress properly while working, right, Jade?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and blinked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's true, but there isn't much to do at the beginning anyway. I have already taken care of all the company matters. Today, your main task is to familiarize yourself with the company's business, and then you can visit different office areas. By the way, I have arranged an office for you. I will take you there later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade smiled at me and spoke like the hostess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few years, she followed my father and unknowingly became very familiar with all aspects of Glory Group's business. Thus, many people mistakenly thought she was the successor my father was grooming, and some even believed she was the heiress of the Mayers family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for me, everyone treated me as a spoiled little girl, and on top of that, I had no interest in Glory Group's business before. Nor had I ever had any contact with Glory Group's executives and shareholders. So, everyone had a negative impression of me. Therefore, after my father fell from power, no one was willing to spare me a second glance, let alone help me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, you can focus on your own things. I have my plans. Dad, didn't you just say in the car that there would be a meeting later? It's getting late. Let's go inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to be bossed around by Jade. Since I decided to work at Glory Group, of course, I had to quickly enter the core leadership.</span></p></div>
