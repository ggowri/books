        <h1>Chapter 578 In the Same Room</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip? Is he on this yacht too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Quinn looked bewildered, as if he had no idea that Philip was also on this yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't see him?" I asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, after I rescued you, I immediately found the doctor on board and arranged a room. I never saw Philip on the yacht at all. How did you end up in the water?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to realize something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "It seems that Philip, upon seeing me fall into the water, has hurriedly slipped away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but recall the events before I fell into the water, feeling a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through gritted teeth, I exclaimed, "You know, Philip is a jerk. I saw him on this yacht with Jezebel, being all cozy. I was about to tell Paige, he tried to grab my phone, and in the struggle, he accidentally pushed me into the sea. If you hadn't shown up, I might have been left for dead here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? He and Jezebel? You mean that D-list celebrity? How could he be with a woman like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn jumped up in astonishment upon hearing my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I never expected it either. And to top it off, Paige is pregnant, and he's keeping it from her," I added, feeling increasingly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe Philip lacked such integrity and responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sat back down, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't rush to tell Paige about this. She's pregnant now, and we don't want her getting too upset and risking premature labor. Since it's already happened, you don't need to worry now. Just rest, and I'll talk to Philip later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't understand how Philip could be involved with someone like Jezebel. Not only is she Giselle's good friend, but her reputation has never been great..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, feeling utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's always been a playboy. Before meeting Paige, he fooled around with many girls. Getting him to settle down was always going to be a challenge. Philip, as a friend, is fine, but as a husband, he's really not ideal," Quinn added, also feeling exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we continued our conversation, the door to the room swung open. I looked up to see Grey entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you awake? I'm so sorry, I wanted to bring you here for some fun, never imagining such a thing would happen," Grey apologized as soon as she entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was an accident. You can't blame yourself. Thanks to Quinn, I'm fine now. Auntie Grey, you shouldn't blame yourself," I quickly reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why shouldn't I blame myself? If Quinn hadn't arrived in time, the consequences could have been disastrous. Thankfully, you and the baby are okay. You must have been terrified at the time, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey sat down and held my hand, her face showing remnants of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She must have been terrified. The sea is so cold. I, as an adult man, could barely handle it, let alone her," Quinn interjected, his tone slightly reproachful. "Auntie Grey, in the future, please don't invite Madeline to such gatherings. She doesn't enjoy them as much as you all do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My main intention was to introduce Madeline to some friends," Grey acknowledged her mistake, smiling sheepishly before changing the subject. "Madeline, this was my oversight. How about this, you mentioned wanting to collaborate with my husband last time. I've already agreed on his behalf. Consider it my way of making it up to you. Find some time to sign the contract with him."</span></p></div>
