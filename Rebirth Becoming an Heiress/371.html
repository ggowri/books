        <h1>Chapter 371 Lucky Charm</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn whispered softly as he placed the lucky charm in my hand, a small gesture that spoke volumes of his care and concern for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a simple token, yet it meant the world to me, a tangible reminder of his unwavering support despite the miles between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you. I feel like I owe you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted, unable to shake the sense of indebtedness that seemed to follow me wherever I went. Quinn's selfless acts of kindness always left me feeling humbled and grateful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have everything I need, Madeline. Besides, why are you so worked up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nonchalant shrug, Quinn dismissed my gratitude, and then asked me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weirdly, I talked to Quinn about things that I was ashamed of speaking up in front of Paige and Fiona. His support made my words come out smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle's pregnant with his child. I fought tooth and nail to defend myself, but in the end, I was left with nothing. Is this destiny?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, my voice remained steady, as if Quinn's mere presence had a calming effect on my turbulent emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's response was characteristically astute.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a feeling that was the cause of your distress. You wouldn't be this upset otherwise."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried a hint of foresight, tinged with a touch of playful ridicule.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am fine." I rolled my eyes at him angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott&mdash;did he confess?" Quinn's tone grew serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze piercing as he broached the topic with solemnity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Elliott stirred a visceral repulsion within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't say it wasn't his. But I don't want to dwell on him any longer."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your plan now? Divorce? Revenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice lowered, his words laced with a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce is inevitable. But can they be allowed to be together without consequences? Can all the deceit and harm he inflicted on me be simply overlooked?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger bubbling within me threatened to overflow, but Quinn's steadying presence offered a sense of grounding amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down. Remember, you're not alone in this," Quinn reassured me, his gaze imbued with a quiet strength that quelled the storm raging within me. "So, what about revenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I struggled to contain the fiery emotions within me, I found solace in Quinn's unwavering support.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost fooled myself into believing he had changed. But reality has a way of waking you up. I want revenge&mdash;I can't let this go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Quinn's presence, I found the courage to speak my truth without fear of judgment. "Okay, then I'll help you. You can take whatever revenge you want," Quinn declared, his sincerity evident in his unwavering gaze as he gently squeezed my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words I couldn't tell anyone but Quinn. He would accept all my negative thoughts with no judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay, then I'll help you. You can take whatever revenge you want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn declared, his sincerity evident in his unwavering gaze as he gently squeezed my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I gazed into Quinn's eyes, a sense of peace washed over me, momentarily overshadowing the turmoil within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet as our eyes met, a chill ran down my spine, and I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Turning towards the small window, I caught sight of a pair of familiar eyes staring at us with malice&mdash;a stark reminder of the challenges that lay ahead.</span></p></div>
