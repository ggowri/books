        <h1>Chapter 893: The Madwoman</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung out with Elliott for a bit longer, and honestly, it was pretty exhausting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a breather, munching on some pastries and fruits to refuel, then made a quick trip to the restroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerging from the restroom, I was in the midst of washing my hands when Lucy suddenly appeared, bumping into my shoulder with a thud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was livid, as if she'd been waiting for this moment for an eternity:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really can't fathom what Elliott sees in you, you're not good at all. He once told me he liked my innocence and charm, you're clearly not that kind of girl."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Innocent and sweet... Wasn't that exactly how Giselle was back then?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott used to ignore me. Turns out, I was never his type from the get-go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Ailton, I've won, haven't I? What do you have to say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot her a cool glance, asking nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not worthy of Elliott, you should leave him. I'll take you back. I can be his right hand, a stubborn woman like you isn't right for him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy crossed her arms. She actually had the audacity to tell me to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled. There sure are a lot of naive women out there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? How do you know I'm not a good help? Have you installed surveillance in my house? Do you know how I interact with Elliott behind closed doors?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was at a loss for words, stomping her foot in frustration before finally speaking:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott wanted to propose to me once. He was in love with me. Everyone knew how much he despised you back then. Your obsession with Elliott was the talk of the town in Hoswich City. Weren't you aware? How did you manage to bewitch him now? Did you slip him a love potion or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Lucy became agitated. Her eyes widened, her features contorted, making her appear quite unhinged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged at me, gripping my collar:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wretched woman, I'm going to kill you, kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An eerily strange sensation enveloped me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed that her consciousness seemed hazy, her entire demeanor was alarmingly off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she seized my throat, using brute force to slam me hard against the wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, out of nowhere, she whipped out a small fruit knife and swung it at me!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nearly jumped out of my skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucy, what are you up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frantic rush, I tried to block her hand that was lunging towards me. But she was swift, strong. The knife still managed to slice my arm in one swift motion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiss...!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It really hurts, hurts so much that my whole body is convulsing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried desperately to stop her, but Lucy, she was like a madwoman, recklessly thrusting the knife towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, I managed to shake her off thanks to my height advantage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stumbled towards the door, and just as she lunged at me with the knife again, a strong hand yanked me powerfully behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, I heard the clatter of a knife hitting the ground, followed by a raspy roar of anger:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucy, have you lost your mind? What the hell are you doing? Someone grab her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security guard, alerted by the noise, rushed over and pinned Lucy to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned, and when he saw my arm, bloody and battered, his eyes welled up with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he swiftly used the small knife to rip open his clothes, then tightly bound my arm with a strip of fabric to stop the bleeding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurts a lot, doesn't it? I'll get you to the hospital right away!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he scooped me up and bolted out the door.</span></p></div>
