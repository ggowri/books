        <h1>Chapter 674 Apologizing to Her</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you were really lucky! Every time, someone was there to protect you from disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sylvia like this, Nicole shouted angrily. She stared at me fiercely like a venomous snake, emanating a strong sense of hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she had intended to splash me, but unexpectedly it was Sylvia who walked out first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sylvia in extreme distress, I had no intention of paying attention to her provocation. I quickly dialed 911 and then hurriedly helped Sylvia up from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia's beautiful face, at this moment, had already swollen up like a steamed bun. She desperately covered her face and cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to my face? Take me to the hospital quickly. I didn't get disfigured like this, did I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There is no woman who doesn't care about her appearance, let alone Sylvia, who is a female celebrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this scene, I was both anxious and angry, wishing I could just beat up Nicole, this insane woman, right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This couldn't be sulfuric acid, as sulfuric acid corrodes the skin. What is it exactly? Speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, seeing Sylvia in such a state, grabbed Nicole's clothes and anxiously asked aloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole didn't care about anything anymore. She looked at Quinn and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's something that can disfigure you. It's just a pity that it didn't splash onto that bitch's face! However, she got lucky this time, but she may not be so fortunate every time! As long as I'm alive, I will definitely make her pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've had enough! Giselle eventually went down the wrong path. You don't reflect on yourself, thinking it's because of your failed education. Instead, you impose all of this onto Madeline! There's never been a mother like you who can't distinguish right </span><span>from wrong! Let me tell you, you may have succeeded today, but I won't allow you to come near Madeline again in the future! You better go to prison and repent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn gritted his teeth and said to Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police and the doctor arrived at the scene quickly. We immediately explained the whole situation to the police, and they swiftly took Nicole away for investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Quinn and I immediately put Sylvia on the ambulance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a commotion, the guests invited by the Bryant family were also alarmed, but no one knew what had happened. When Elliott rushed out, Quinn and I had already accompanied Sylvia onto the ambulance and quickly headed toward the direction of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Nicole splashed not sulfuric acid, but pepper spray, which, although intense, did not disfigure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving at the hospital, the doctor urgently treated Sylvia's face and quickly applied ointment, informing her that her face might continue to be red and swollen for a while. However, once the swelling subsided, her face would return to its original state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we heard the news that wouldn't disfigure us, we all felt relieved. Sylvia, in particular, was so excited that she covered her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, it wasn't sulfuric acid. I was really scared just now. Does that woman have mental issues? I feel like she's gone crazy. If we had known she would act like this, we should have called the police directly instead of letting her go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I originally decided to let go of everything Giselle did in the bathroom, considering that she had already passed away and was also old. However, to my surprise, she went even further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of Nicole's crazy appearance and couldn't help but shake my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I just wanted to quietly come to bid farewell to Mr. Cormac Bryant, but I didn't expect such a speechless incident to occur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be more careful in the future. You are in the late stages of pregnancy now, so you can't be away from people around you. Fortunately, Ms. Hart is fine this time. Otherwise it would have been a shame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said this with lingering fear.</span></p></div>
