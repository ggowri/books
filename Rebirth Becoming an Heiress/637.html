        <h1>Chapter 637 Manipulating Public Opinion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was really good at manipulating public opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, titles like these and highly sensational stories spread across the internet, thrusting me into the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photos that Adam put up looked hazy, my appearance wasn't recognizable. But both the composition and the atmosphere were mysterious, making one unable to resist speculating about the identity of the female protagonist in these stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably made deliberate efforts to guide public opinion under these posts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, soon there were many comments below speculating on who the male and female protagonists of these stories were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As curiosity was aroused among everyone, Adam once again released my speech on the Lotus Forum and manipulated public opinion, portraying me as an independent and strong woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These one after another small stories, successfully shattered those embellished stories about Giselle, and everyone quickly understood the truth of the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone understood that my ex-husband was Elliott, Giselle was an immoral mistress, and that child who was valued by the Bryant family was a bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Public opinions instantly erupted into an uproar, and the reputation completely reversed in my favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Mr. Bryant was so blind that he gave up such a good woman and actually got engaged to a mistress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, the woman who became beautiful and charming after her divorce, bad men slowly regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it impressive for a mistress to have a son? Truly powerful women don't need to keep a man with children. All mistresses should just die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, comments like these began to fill the entire internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had previously praised Elliott and Giselle's little story are now condemning Giselle as a mistress and mocking Elliott. Everyone in the comments section is subtly criticizing them, saying it was simply not worth the loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably never imagined that her intention to create a beautiful story between her and Elliott in advance would be ruined so soon. Things were messed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... Madeline, I did it! Now I can't wait to see how Giselle will explain this on the day of their engagement!" Adam excitedly showed off his achievements on the internet in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at those comments, I also felt delighted, so I couldn't help but ask with a smile, "You're really amazing. Where did you hear these little stories from? I haven't mentioned them to you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam smiled mysteriously and said, "Some stories were made up, some were guessed. Madeline, how about it? I am good at telling stories, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you write all of these? Adam, I never expected you to have the potential for public relations," I was surprised to find Adam's talent in this area through this incident. I couldn't help but praise him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, when I was in college, I was the editor-in-chief of our school newspaper. Giselle's actions are all things I used to do. With me around, I won't let her have the opportunity to defame you in public opinion!" Adam patted his chest and assured me </span><span>with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I wouldn't give Giselle any chance to defame me. It's not just her, no one should think they can defame me with the support of the masses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, and at the same time, I had already made sufficient preparations, only waiting for their engagement banquet to begin...</span></p></div>
