        <h1>Chapter 398 Finally Awake</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, after a bunch of doctors had their say and some traditional medicine mojo, my dad, Austin, slowly cracked open his eyes, with everyone holding their breath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he just moved his eyes around, trying to lift his eyelids a few times but struggling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and I held onto his hand, yelling our hearts out until he managed to pry those lids open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a miracle, seriously. Tears of joy flowed as Lily and I hugged Dad tight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Way to go, Pops!" the doctors cheered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole ward lit up with happiness. But Lily was over the moon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to hog Dad's attention too much, so I let Lily take over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been through the wringer during this whole mess, and now that Dad was awake, she had a lot to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I cleared the ward and left Mom and Dad to catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I headed to the corridor, cracked open a window, and let the breeze calm my nerves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today was wild, huh? You and your mom went through so much, but hey, looks like it nudged your dad awake. Blessing in disguise, I guess?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn hadn't left yet, standing beside me with a sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, maybe Dad woke up because he heard us dealing with all that drama. Guess it was a wake-up call in more ways than one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor also mentioned that Dad's treatment alone wouldn't cut it. He needed something extra to kickstart his recovery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably didn't realize her stunt actually helped me out in the end. Funny how things worked out, huh?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, gotta hand it to Giselle. Without all that fuss, Dad might've taken longer to wake up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned against the window, watching the tree branches sway, trying to keep my cool.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for thanks. Giselle's a puzzle, always up to something. So, Madeline, what's the move now?" Quinn asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" I turned to him, giving a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything going on, my head's been spinning, couldn't sort out my thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean you and Elliott...." Quinn's voice was low, almost a murmur.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce is looming, no doubt about it. But Giselle's pushing hard for it, and I'm not about to let her win that easily. I need to shut down any chance she has with Elliott before pulling the plug."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laid it out for Quinn, no sugarcoating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked at me, surprised, but there was a hint of concern on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you don't divorce, won't you and Elliott keep getting caught up? Aren't you afraid your feelings will get deeper? And if that kid's really Elliott's, how do you plan to keep them apart?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words hit home, even if I didn't want to admit it.</span></p></div>
