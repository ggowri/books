        <h1>Chapter 188 He Spared Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was almost suffocating, but finally, I found a moment to catch my breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, who was determined, kissed my lips fiercely, but had no intention of sparing other parts of my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He traced down along my earlobe, and everywhere he went, my blood couldn't help but boil, my whole body became scorching hot, almost sinking into the deep sea of desire, indulging, struggling to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, spare me..." I had been retreating step by step, until finally, I could only attempt to utter a pleading voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't," he said, "you are my wife." He had no intention of stopping, and as soon as he finished speaking, he stripped off my coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you were so selfish, you didn't love me at all!" I opened my eyes, struggling and shouting at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he acted as if he hadn't heard a word, his eyes filled with a strong desire to conquer, as if he had to conquer me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, if you hurt me today, I will hate you for the rest of my life, I swear," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, please stop it. The person you love is not me at all. Why are you treating me like this?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! Just for your little desire for conquest, you treat me like this. Don't you think you're simply a beast?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as he took off each piece of clothing from my body, and I watched as he was about to proceed with the next step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tears flowed uncontrollably, and all kinds of words poured out of my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was not until this moment that I realized, I had been resisting him all along, resisting to the point where his touch did not bring me any happiness, but instead a nauseating feeling that I couldn't put into words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stopped when he was about to take the final step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, my words and actions gradually extinguished the evil fire in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coercion would not receive a response, such a simple truth, he could not possibly not understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows and looked at me with deep and perplexed eyes, filled with intense confusion and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably didn't understand why this woman, who had once eagerly waited for his pity and even drugged him to gain his pity, would now resist him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you..." he wanted to ask something, but halfway through his sentence, he didn't ask it. Instead, he rolled over from me and lay weakly on the side, sighing heavily towards the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly sat up and immediately found my clothes to put on haphazardly, without a moment's hesitation, I flipped off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can rest here if you want, I'm leaving," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stay in the room with him for long. In fact, I was starting to feel more and more suffocated by the air when I was alone with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came over these days, just to wait for you," he said behind me, his low voice causing a slight tremor in my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, then you don't have to come any longer. The injury on my head has already healed, you don't have to worry about it." My tone remained distant, I admit, I was surprised that he wanted to get close to my parents, but I didn't feel touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't we be together properly? Like other couples?" he asked once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment when I heard this question, I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and buttoned up the buttons one by one. I said softly, "Perhaps soon, you won't think like this anymore. You will wish that I stay away from you, just like you did before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on their current progress, they should have fallen in love with each other soon, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than waiting for him to come and ask for a divorce, I'd better take the opportunity to withdraw while I am still sober, so as to avoid being hurt by him again and find it difficult to recover later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you always think that I would fall in love with someone else?"</span></p></div>
