        <h1>Chapter 150 Knock Me Down</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been insulted like this by anyone before. I was extremely angry, and I shouted loudly, immediately wanting to pull up my skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, he directly broke my hand and then lifted both of my hands high above my head. He ignored the fact that I was only wearing intimate underwear and coldly whispered in my ear, "It's you who's gone crazy, Madeline! You're crossing my limits more and more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line? What bottom line?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked at him, my chest heaving violently, as I asked aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were already married! And yet, here you are in a bar with a group of young men, even going up on stage to dance. Do I mean anything to you at all? I am your husband," he exclaimed, his anger evident in his furious tone and chilling demeanor. I could tell just how enraged he was by the intense throbbing of his Adam's apple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you following me? Elliott, when did you start paying so much attention to my every move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the day, I was not satisfied with stimulating him in the alley. At this moment, since I was being restrained by him, I decided to deliberately and crazily stimulate him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Allowing you to come to work was already my greatest tolerance, don't push your luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me coldly, his eyes seemed as if they could carve the words "married" on my forehead with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I just married you, it doesn't mean my life is under your control, you don't have the right to interfere with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him and said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, all my obedience and respect towards him were out of love. Now that I no longer love him, I naturally act as recklessly as I want, regardless of who he is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you asking for death?" Elliott forcefully yanked off the tie around my neck, his voice cold. "Tonight, I will make you understand whether or not I have the right to interfere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He completely pressed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could say anything, he had already bitten my lips hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately wanted to resist, to speak up, but this time, his kiss was even more fierce than in the alley, to be precise, it was ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain accompanied by a salty taste quickly filled my mouth as he bit through my lips, using an extremely powerful force to pry them open directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid no attention to us in the car at the moment, with Toby still in the front seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just ripped off my intimate underwear like that, then tightly clasped me in his arms like a pair of pliers, kissing me so intensely that I almost suffocated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't breathe at all. I was completely pinned down by his 6-foot-tall body, and he openly issued the most extreme provocation to me with absolute gender superiority!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The carriage instantly turned into a scene of madness. Soon, my face, my eyes, my nose, my neck, were all crazily swept over by his kisses, dense like raindrops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that Elliott would be so crazy. He went crazy as if he were a lustful lion, completely disregarding everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that his madness would be directed towards me, especially considering that he had openly declared in the past that I was a woman he had absolutely no interest in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared wide-eyed, losing my words and my mind went blank under his oppressive attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt my territory gradually being lost under his attack. I couldn't resist because I had never experienced such an onslaught before. At this moment, I was already bewildered and then plunged into a trembling I had never reached before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know when Toby drove the car to the hotel parking lot, and I didn't know what time it was. Even when my phone rang, I still felt numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wrapped me up in the blanket that was placed in the car, and then he picked me up in his arms. By the time I regained consciousness, he had already brought me to the presidential suite of a hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was thrown onto the big bed by him, and before I could struggle, he pounced on me again like a tiger, leaving me no room to catch my breath.</span></p></div>
