        <h1>Chapter 755: First Encounter with Lucas</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take your word for it. But Marcus, you've got to take good care of Jane. Make sure she doesn't suffer any long-term effects, or I'll be plagued with guilt for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reiterated to Marcus once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, I'll take good care of her. Both Jane and I have served in the military, so this kind of injury won't affect her too much. Actually, I feel guilty. If I hadn't suggested you guys to go on a field trip to Norch City, you probably wouldn't have experienced this accident."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at me, his eyes brimming with regret and sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything has already happened, so let's not blame ourselves. After all, we've survived such a severe accident, we're bound to be luckier and happier in the future. As long as we're all okay, that's all that matters."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their guilt, Quinn comforted them with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying in the hospital bed, having just survived a catastrophe, I found myself looking at the sincere faces of my friends gathered around me. In that moment, I realized that their presence was more precious than anything else in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had I not divorced back then, how could I have possibly gained such a wealth of friends? Friendships that are stronger and more precious than gold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was laid up in bed for a solid week before I could finally get up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the first thing I did after getting out of bed was to rush to the newborn nursery to see Lucas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Fiona sending me daily videos of Lucas in the neonatal ward, nothing could compare to the sheer awe I felt the first time I saw him in person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I went to see him, he was awake. Dressed in a white garment, he lay quietly in the incubator, his round, wide eyes darting curiously around. His chubby little hands were in constant motion, and his mouth occasionally formed an "O" shape. The sight of his rosy little hands and his tiny, chubby face warmed my heart instantly. At that moment, my heart seemed to turn into honey, so sweet that it left me breathless...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the little gem that's been growing inside me, from a tiny speck to what it is now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the barrier of the incubator, I held back the tears welling in my eyes, resting my hand on the edge of the box. How I yearned to reach in and grasp his tiny hand, to cradle his small, soft body in my arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he just adorable?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was by my side, whispering softly into my ear. At the same time, he rested his hand on the outside of the thermal box.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the moment Quinn laid his hand on the incubator, it was as if Noah sensed it. His tiny hand waved in the air, and then, astonishingly, he made the sign for "I love you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I knew Lucas' action was unintentional, in that split second, I felt a jolt through my body, as if I'd been electrified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Quinn saw it too. He looked at me, equally stunned. We both found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone, intending to capture this unique scene. However, no sooner had I drawn out my phone than it began to vibrate abruptly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I saw the name displayed on the screen, I froze. I never thought he would actually call me...</span></p></div>
