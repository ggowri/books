        <h1>Chapter 400 Disgusting</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's hold off on suing the Bryant family for now. Dad just woke up, and we need to focus on his recovery first. I've got it under control," I reassured her, trying to keep things calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mom was fired up. "I was hopeful when I saw Elliott </span><span>had a crush on</span><span> you. But now, this stunt? With his parents backing him? Unbelievable! I'm </span><span>telling </span><span>the word about the real Bryants!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mom's anger was rare, and it showed how serious this situation was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's focus on Dad for now. I was thinking of transferring him back to Fiona's place. What do you think?" I whispered as I patted my mother's shoulder gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I just wanted to get far away from the Bryant family and all the drama.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the </span><span>people </span><span>of Laura, Jasper, Giselle, and Nicole was the last thing I wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing. Let's hit up Fiona and check if they've got an available bed. If they do, we'll arrange for </span><span>him</span><span>to be picked up ASAP," Mom promptly agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was about to dial Fiona's number, I heard footsteps echoing down the corridor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced up and saw Elliott strolling down the corridor all serious-like.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alone, no one with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott spotted us in the hallway, he strolled over and asked, "Mrs. Mayers, Madeline, how's Mr. Mayers doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom, usually friendly with him, wasn't having it this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted, "Elliott, why the sudden politeness? Spare me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot her a look, sincere as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Mayers, today's mess is on me. I'll make sure nobody disturbs him again. </span><span>I promise</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept quiet while my mom gave Elliott a cold reply, "No need for niceties. We've troubled you enough. We'll move Austin back to Fiona's to avoid causing any more fuss here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed taken aback by the idea of us moving </span><span>my dad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put a hand on my shoulder, saying, "Madeline, your dad's up now. The treatment's working. You sure about going back to Fiona's?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words mirrored my own doubts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad hadn't shown much improvement for a while, but now he was awake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Giselle and her crew's little blunder, maybe it was also thanks to those doctor's plan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dad had just woken up, and his condition was still unstable. Staying put seemed wise, but I couldn't stand being pushed around here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gently shrugged off Elliott's hand and kept my cool, staying silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked up on my vibe and grabbed my hand, leading me out. I was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" I yelled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have dinner and chat," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had a tight hold on my wrist, refusing to let go despite my efforts to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, there's not much to talk about!" I protested, growing louder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot me a look, then glanced at my mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some things are better said one-on-one."</span></p></div>
