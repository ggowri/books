        <h1>Chapter 154 Memory</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted it lightly, but didn't say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at me subconsciously, and at that moment, I clearly felt a trace of doubt in his eyes. However, he didn't ask further and quickly drove me back to our hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I returned to the hotel, I immediately took a shower and changed clothes. It was not until I finished showering and faced the mirror that I realized there were several very noticeable red marks on my neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my... Elliott was really wild last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at myself in the mirror and subconsciously touched those few obvious marks. My face turned red involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene from last night flashed before my eyes in an instant, everything seemed hazy like a dream... I quickly shook my head, trying to wake up and return to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a noticeable mark on her neck, no wonder Paige has been smiling strangely since I walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely embarrassed, but I couldn't find anything to cover up with, so I desperately used concealer to erase those marks. However, no matter how much I applied, they could still be vaguely seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way, so I had to give up and walked out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw me and smiled directly, "Why did you paint your neck so white? Doesn't it make the marks look even redder? It seems like you had an exceptionally intense night last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I angrily threw a pillow at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, could you please stop making a fuss? It's not at all what you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk tsk, it has come to this, what else could it be? Could it be that Elliott was never capable in the first place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige happily took the pillow, this outspoken woman could say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, really, I'm not going to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was both angry and annoyed, but I didn't know what to do. I could only hold back my red face and let her mock and ridicule me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and I had a little fun, and then we planned to head back to Louis City. She told me that her motel was nearing completion and would soon be officially open for business. She had to go back and busy herself with setting up each room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went back to Louis City first, and Adam and I went to the set again. After staying at the set for the whole morning, we had lunch and then prepared to return to Louis City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, the weather was originally fine. However, when we reached the highway, the sky suddenly started pouring heavy rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had to slow down the car and walked laboriously in the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was bowing my head and scrolling through my phone when suddenly a piece news popped up in front of my eyes: "The Hoswich Medical Equipment Expo, organized by Bryant Group, is scheduled to take place at the end of the month at the Hoswich International Exhibition Center."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news is small, however, the word "Bryant Group" immediately caught my attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medical equipment is one of the several business sectors of Bryant Group and also a key project of Bryant Group. This exhibition is also a highly valued one by Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely remember the last conversation between Elliott and Giselle. From what I recall, Giselle seemed to mention her desire to be involved in the planning of some exhibition, and at that time, Elliott immediately agreed to let her participate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The raindrops, as big as beans, heavily pounded on the car window, and with this heavy rain, the memories of my previous life also began to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy rain, the expo, Giselle... The combination of these three things suddenly reminded me of a crucial point that I had forgotten in my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I quickly glanced at the date displayed on my phone out of instinct. Yes, that thing happened today. There is no mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, my entire nerves instantly tensed up!</span></p></div>
