        <h1>Chapter 138 Forgetting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank was invited by Adam on my behalf, because I knew that I didn't have enough influence with my current position at Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Frank came in, he detailed his views on the casting for this production and his confidence in the play. Upon hearing this, the two shareholders immediately shut their mouths in disappointment and did not express any further opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she had no charisma at all. Even if she had excellent acting skills, what's the use if she didn't have any fans supporting her? We can't possibly spend a fortune on promotion in the later stages, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was already at a disadvantage at this time, but she still argued defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a video that was recently posted on the website, and it has already reached a billion views. It is a free public service announcement film shot by Audrey not long ago... Although this promotional film is short, it has gained a billion views in a short period of time. Moreover, it is still soaring in popularity. I have high hopes for this girl, I think she has great potential and it's worth taking a risk on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a seasoned director in the industry, Frank presented solid evidence to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree. Instead of using those third-rate actors, why not give newcomers a try? Perhaps miracles can happen. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Austin had already understood everything. He knew that once I set my mind to something, I would see it through to the end, just like how I commit to loving someone for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had already said so, and the two shareholders couldn't say anything for a moment. So, they nodded and tacitly agreed to my decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade wanted to say something else. Seeing that she was about to speak, I didn't want to give her any chance to talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's settled then. Our schedule is quite tight, so I would like to present this play as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, Austin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade still wanted to say something, but I interrupted her directly, "Jade, I have already made up my mind about this matter, so you don't need to say anything more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the two shareholders, I had to make it clear to them who the real heiress of the Mayers family is and who Austin truly supports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade showed her anger directly. She clenched her fists, and the hostility on her face looked terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I just coldly glanced at her and turned around, walking out of Austin's office door with Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, we determined the time to go to Louis City Film and Television Base for shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I disregarded my leg injury and went directly to Louis City with Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once people get busy with work, time really flies. A week passes in the blink of an eye, and during this week, it's as if I completely forgot about Elliott, not a single moment did I think of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not until Adam drove past the Bryant Group building and looked at the towering office building that I suddenly remembered that I was still Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, I realized that my so-called husband had not contacted me for a whole week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since that night when I chose to get into Quinn's car, it was as if he disappeared from my world. He never inquired about anything concerning me, and I never even thought about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the time when I loved him for so many years, this was the first time I discovered that I could actually momentarily forget about him...</span></p></div>
