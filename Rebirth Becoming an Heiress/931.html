        <h1>Chapter 931 Fever</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to get up from the bed, but the moment I did, a feeling of dizziness came over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after that, I only felt a burning sensation as my stomach rolled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I managed to find a trash can in the room, and at once, I couldn't help but vomit into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was even more depressing was that I didn't know what was going on, but a sharp pain came from the soles of my feet, causing a cold sweat to break out all over my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, what's wrong with you? Why haven't you come out yet?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably seeing that I hadn't come out for a long time, Fiona knocked on my door and shouted from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, I </span><span>......</span><span> I'm not feeling well.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted at the top of my lungs as best as I could, yet my voice was still not very loud as I finished throwing up and my entire body went limp and collapsed to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of my lack of strength, my hands went limp and I accidentally dropped my phone on the floor with a crisp thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona heard something was wrong, so she immediately pushed open the door to my room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw me still in my pajamas and lying on the floor, she was shocked and came over to me in a panic:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, what's wrong with you? What's going on, are you not feeling well?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, I feel cold all over, I'm dizzy, and the soles of my feet hurt, I don't know what's wrong.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said as I looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona is a doctor, as soon as she heard me say that, she immediately realized that something was wrong, then she reached out and probed my forehead and immediately exclaimed:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's hot, you have a fever, Madeline.You just said that the soles of your feet hurt? Which foot, let me see!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This right foot.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pointed to my right foot, and Fiona sniffed and immediately pinched a part of my right foot with her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, she merely pinched it lightly, but I couldn't help but cry out in pain:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, don't pinch here, it hurts here!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's entire expression cracked when she heard me cry out like that, and she looked at me, frowning as she said to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, it's over, not only do you have a fever, but you also have gout! It's probably from that seafood dinner yesterday! You wait, I'll go get Elliott right away and see if there's a hospital nearby, I'll send you there first!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona immediately made a judgment call, and as she stood up, she drew her legs and went out to find Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige wasn't in the room, she had been traveling for the last couple of days, and the two of them, Orson, were very jovial, and presumably had gone to breakfast together again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly called for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott appeared, he saw me sitting on the floor and immediately stepped forward before tackling me to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with unrivaled concern, and likewise reached out to probe my forehead, after which he said with a frown on his face:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Your temperature is not low. It's just that it's still a bit far from the hospital and we're going to miss our flight.Fiona, how about this, I'll have Orson take you and Paige to the airport to wait for your flight first, and I'll take Madeline to the hospital to take a look, and the two of us will change our flights, so that we don't delay your trip, what do you think?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took me into his arms as he looked up to consult with Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona frowned with the same concern:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Will you be okay taking Madeline to the hospital by yourself if we all leave? Either that, or let's all change our tickets together?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said so, but there was clearly a hint of hesitation on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered that she had said last night that she had to rush back today, one of her patients was admitted to the hospital last night due to a sudden hemorrhage and could go into labor at any time, and the patient, who didn't trust the other doctors, wanted her to be the one to take charge of the operation when the time came, and she had promised that patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's okay, just let Elliott stay with me, you and Paige go back first, you have patients waiting for you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, so I said to Fiona in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But, can Elliott do it alone?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was still a little worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's fine, I'm here, don't worry. You guys don't dwell on it, hurry up and pack your bags and leave, it's not far from the time of boarding.Madeline, let Fiona assist you in changing your clothes first, I'll wait for you outside.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finished, turned around and walked out, and closed the door to the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the bed, at this point there was a growing feeling of drowsiness in my brain and the pain in the soles of my feet was getting more and more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona helped me find a set of lightweight going out clothes in the suitcase and helped me change into them together, then, helped me walk out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw how weak I was and he didn't hesitate to pick me up once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we said a quick hello to Paige and Orson, Elliott carried me to the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resort hotel we were at was a first class setting, just a little out of the way and some distance from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, the cramped space in the cab and the odor that emanated from the leather seats in the car made me feel more and more uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back in the seat, and Elliott, seeing how uncomfortable I was, couldn't help but take me gently into his arms again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had probably studied massage, and he used his warm palms to help me press gently on my head for a moment, and then, later, on my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that the pain had indeed eased a bit, but my body was still cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if there was a cool wind blowing in, my whole body was shivering, and the coldness that emanated from deep inside my body made me unable to stop myself from falling into Elliott's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged me tightly, softly comforting me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Don't be afraid, we'll be at the hospital in about ten minutes. If you're having a hard time, just go to sleep and I'll stay with you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, my head </span><span>......</span><span> is so dizzy.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wailed, hiding in his arms, helpless as a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I somewhat regret the indulgence of the past few days, the past few days on the strength of Elliott to pay the bill, we all the way wantonly indulged our spleen and stomach, all kinds of expensive seafood and sashimi ate a lot, and experienced surfing, beach motorcycle, horseback riding, and a series of exciting projects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just had a baby after all, and it was completely different from before to indulge so much, and now that the consequences were coming, it was too late for me to regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I'm in, you get some sleep.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was so gentle, he whispered in my ear as he gently kneaded my palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was hard as hell, my whole body was like a boneless baby that was glued to his arms </span><span>......</span></p></div>
