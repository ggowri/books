        <h1>Chapter 518 Inform His Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant the situation in Carthage was extremely dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but glance worriedly at Quinn lying on the bed, thinking, "With Carthage's healthcare system being so lacking, Quinn's injured, and running a high fever, I'm really concerned that his condition might worsen without timely and effective treatment. If things go south, how will I explain to his parents and family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have they mentioned how long the lockdown might last?" I asked Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam shook his head. "No one knows how long the lockdown might last. All entrances to Carthage are heavily guarded, and no one can leave. The worst part is that mainstream media isn't covering here. That's why this hospital is on the brink of a crisis, with supplies running critically low. If this continues, we might not be able to cope. People are starting to get restless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words weighed heavily on my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly dawned on me that I hadn't been able to reach Quinn by phone earlier. I didn't know if he'd managed to contact his family or if they even knew where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I immediately called Paige. "Paige, could you ask Philip if he knows how to reach Quinn's sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, unaware that I was in Carthage, sounded puzzled when she answered, "What's wrong, Madeline? Why do you need Quinn's sister's contact information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in Carthage right now. The virus situation here is severe, and the city is under complete lockdown. Quinn got injured, and I just want to inform his family so they won't worry if they can't reach him," I explained quickly over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Quinn got injured? Is he okay? How did he get hurt out of the blue? Hold on, let me ask Philip. Once I get the number, I'll send it to you right away. Madeline, why are you in Carthage?" Paige's voice turned frantic upon hearing my news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't explain it all right now. I'll fill you in when I get back. Just please ask Philip for me," I replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the situation pressing, I didn't have time to spare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Carthage's current state, if patients weren't receiving proper treatment and supplies remained scarce, another riot was likely to erupt. And with the density of people here, innocent lives would undoubtedly be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My priority was to convince the hospital director that our anti-flu capsules were more effective than antibiotics. Only then could we swiftly distribute the medicine to the patients, helping them recover sooner. This was the most effective way to save lives at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Quinn, I knew I couldn't change everyone's minds. I could only use Quinn's fever as an example to persuade the hospital's leadership of the medicine's effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paige sent Quinn's sister's contact information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, I dialed the number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few rings, a calm female voice answered, "Hello, who's this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Ms. Woods, Quinn's sister? I'm a friend of Quinn's, Madeline Bryant," I introduced myself promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Carole's voice crackled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that's me. Do you know where Quinn is? We haven't heard from him in two days and are worried sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Quinn hadn't informed his family of his whereabouts. Hearing Carole's distress, I quickly reassured her, "Carole, please don't worry. I'm with Quinn right now. We're currently in Carthage. He's resting after being injured, so he's unable to talk to you at the moment."</span></p></div>
