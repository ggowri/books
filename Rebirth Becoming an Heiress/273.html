        <h1>Chapter 273 Caught in the Act</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly replied to me, "Yeah. Is this guy at it again with the girls?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed my judgment was spot on. Indeed, it was Philip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my mask, I blended in with the group of young girls. Philip clearly hadn't expected me to be present, and at this moment, he was pulling out all the stops to chat up one of the girls.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was tall and dressed in a white angel gown with wings attached to her back. She wore a cute mask, and her golden curls added to her charming appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip ordered the most expensive wine in the house and had the waiter bring over a fruit platter and sashimi. With his extravagant gestures, it was evident he already saw the young girl in front of him as tonight's prey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nestled in a corner, I observed him quietly. Finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore and texted Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, what's the deal between Paige and Philip right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly replied, "Paige is deeply in love, and Philip claims he'll take responsibility. However, Paige feels he hasn't fully committed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Philip again, who was now whispering intimately to the angel, it was clear he wasn't fully committed to his relationship with Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I messaged back, "So, are they officially together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona replied, "According to Paige, yes, but it's not made public yet. Philip says he needs some time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Fiona's insight, I had a better understanding of their situation. So, I directly tagged Paige in the group chat with the three of us, asking her, "Paige, where are you right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Paige replied instantly with an angry emoji and some words. "I'm on the highway to Louis City. That bastard, Philip, went to a costume party without telling me. I'm going to find him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had already tipped off Paige in advance. Seeing her message and the emoji, I couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect timing. I'm keeping an eye on him for you right now. Hurry over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, I immediately forwarded the photo of Philip sitting with the angel to Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona responded with a facepalm emoji. "Damn, I knew he wouldn't change, but Paige still wouldn't believe me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also sent a bloody knife emoji. "Madeline, are you there too? Keep an eye on him for me. I'll chop him up when I get there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though we were catching him red-handed in his act of cheating on her, I couldn't help but find it amusing. I quickly replied, "Don't worry. I've got this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I waited for the great show to unfold, I sat back in the corner, observing Philip's attempts to charm the angel. He alternated between pouring her drinks and feeding her sashimi. It was clear they hit it off well, as they soon removed each other's masks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip had a handsome, clean-cut appearance, almost like a celebrity. Naturally, he was quite appealing to the young girl. Her expression grew even more bashful as she saw his charming face revealed after removing his mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to intervene and interrupt their fervent conversation, a man who had been sitting quietly in the corner, also dressed in a black robe and wearing a devil mask, walked up to me and took a seat beside me.</span></p></div>
