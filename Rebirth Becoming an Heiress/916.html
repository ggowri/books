        <h1>Chapter 916: Choosing Solitude</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden thought startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it felt like a revelation at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, ever since I got pregnant with Noah, I had prepared myself to raise him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how did I end up in this dilemma of having to choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, happiness doesn't depend on others; it depends on your mindset. Quinn is a reliable man, but if you don't feel strongly enough about him, even being together won't bring you the happiness you seek."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam analyzed seriously, sounding like an expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words reminded me that no matter what choice I make, I should follow my heart and listen to my true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Adam left, I called Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if waiting for my call, Quinn answered quickly, his voice gentle:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how was the lunch I made?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ate it. It was delicious. Thank you, Quinn. But please, don't go out of your way to bring me lunch anymore, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mustered the courage to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn paused for a few seconds, his gentle voice turning to disappointment:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, was it not good? Did it not suit your taste? I'll adjust it tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Quinn," I paused and continued, "The lunch was great and suited my taste, but I don't want your life to revolve around me. You should have your own life, not constantly adjusting for me. I can't accept such kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you rejecting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice rose, clearly more disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried to explain:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you should live your own life, like you used to&mdash;free and unrestrained. Not constantly thinking about my preferences or taking care of my family. Such kindness is stressful for me and unfair to you. If you truly like me, you should be yourself first. Remember when I just got divorced, and you advised me not to lose myself in my love for Elliott? You told me to find myself. But don't you think that while I found myself, you lost yourself in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After my words, Quinn fell into a long silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's smart; I knew he understood what I was really saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the phone, waiting quietly. After what felt like an eternity, his voice finally came through:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I've thought about it. You're right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled, though he couldn't see it, and said softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good that you understand. This is the issue between us. You're now like I was with Elliott. You've been waiting for my answer, but you should ask yourself first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pondered for a while longer, then I heard his hearty laugh:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you've grown a lot, and I've regressed. Alright, I get it. I know what to do now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Quinn hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew my words had given him enough insight to understand what he needed to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After calling Quinn, I dialed Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, Elliott answered almost immediately, his voice excited:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did you like the flowers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did, but it was too extravagant. I had them distributed among my female colleagues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone was flat, and he noticed, his cheerful voice turning somber:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like you didn't like them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, we've said everything that needed to be said. You know the whole story now, so there's no need for me to repeat it. You live your life, and I'll live mine. Isn't that better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't as polite with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, we owed each other nothing now, so there was no need for excessive politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was silent for a moment, then I heard his slightly self-deprecating, low voice:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it seems nothing I say can move you any more, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice was clear and rational:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were before, any small change you made for me would have made me ecstatic. But now, I don't need that anymore. The shares of Bryant Group are indeed a significant fortune, but I don't need that much money. I have my own business, and what I earn is enough for my daily expenses. I admit I used to crave a grand wedding and utmost respect, but now they don't matter to me. More than marriage, I want to see the world. The world is so big, and I don't want to be tied down by the past. I want to see more, experience more, and try more possibilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words were not just for Elliott, but also for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I said all this in one breath, I felt all the inner struggles and conflicts of the past days vanish instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had finally broken free from the emotional whirlpool of moral coercion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, I wasn't moved by Elliott's generous compensation, nor did I fall into guilt over Quinn. These were my true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt much freer, and the world seemed instantly more serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was probably stunned by my words. I heard a loud noise on the other end, like a phone dropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some commotion, his voice became clear again:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're really different now. I understand what you mean. But hearing you say this makes me admire you even more. I respect your decision, but I must tell you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused and took a deep breath...</span></p></div>
