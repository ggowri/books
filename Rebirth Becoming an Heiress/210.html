        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put my arms around Elliott's neck. He carried me into the bathroom and then put me down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do some exercise on the balcony."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had the habit of exercising in the morning, which had never changed over the years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and started brushing my teeth in a daze in front of the mirror, only to find that there was a smile on my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Elliott's tenderness in these two days had melted me, and my sanity had long since disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I brushed my teeth and did simple skin care. When I came out, Elliott completed the last set of exercises. He walked in from the terrace and began to wash up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a set of white sportswear from the suitcase and put it on, tied my hair into a ponytail, and then wore a black peaked cap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finished washing up and walked out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put on a set of black sportswear. We looked like wearing a couple's outfit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went downstairs with Elliott. He picked up the shoulder bag he had prepared a long time ago, took my hand, and walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Louis City, the morning air was fresh. We had a simple breakfast downstairs, and then Elliott drove toward Flora Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was pretty good in autumn, and the melodious music in the car made me feel very relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't talk much. After driving for nearly an hour, we arrived at the&nbsp;foot of Flora Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was nice, with sunshine and breeze. It was really good to climb a mountain in this kind of weather.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott carried the single-shoulder bag. We walked along the mountain road and soon began to climb up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't remember how long it had been since I climbed a mountain. The last time I climbed a mountain was in college.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't gone far before I gasped. Elliott had been exercising all year round. He looked relaxed and without gasping at all, which made me despise myself for being weak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Elliott turned to ask me, "Are you okay? Can you continue walking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me blushing and gasping, he couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm a little tired," I smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Give me your hand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stretched out his hand towards me. I hesitated for a moment and held his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palm was warm, and he was strong. He pulled me and walked forward. With his help, I immediately felt much more relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed him all the way. He knew that I had no strength, so he was so considerate along the way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stood and gazed at the scenery or stopped to drink water before walking forward. Not long after, we were halfway up the mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had climbed the Flora Mountain a few years ago. The most beautiful way to take pictures was from this angle. Stand over there, and I'll take a picture for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were not in Hoswich. Without these identities and statuses, I felt Elliott was extraordinarily cordial, as if he was really my acquaintance who had been with me for many years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although my legs were a little weak and tired, such a trip made me feel particularly relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I listened to Elliott and stood over there. He raised his mobile phone and took a few photos of me, and then he sent them all to my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time&nbsp;that he took photos of me. I looked at myself in these photos, and an inexplicable happiness welled up in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was very good at taking photos. The angles and compositions of these photos were pretty good. I looked good and full of energy in them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to take a photo of you?" I asked him with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely listened to others, but he readily agreed with me and stood there. I picked up my phone and took a few photos of him.</span></p></div>
