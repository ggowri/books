        <h1>Chapter 402 Don't Wish to Fall Deeper</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart thumped like a drum solo in my chest, mirroring the frantic bobbing of his Adam's apple, until he finally looked up, his voice barely a croak as he mumbled the words out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The test didn't work. My mom wouldn't let us do it. Apparently, she's worried an amniocentesis might hurt the baby now that Giselle's pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for all his big talk and dragging Giselle in for a test, they came up empty-handed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I felt as if a thousand needles had mercilessly pierced through me, causing excruciating heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a previous life, Elliott would stand firm for Giselle, daring to defy anyone, including his own parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet in this life, he couldn't even handle his mother's unreasonable demands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it truly his incapacity, or did he also fear harming the child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he already known that Giselle was pregnant with his child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent involuntary shivers coursing through my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me in such a state, Elliott instinctively sought to draw closer. However, I immediately pushed him away with all my might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flinched back, shoving him away with all my might. "Is it your mom or do you already know the whole deal with the kid? If it's the latter, then let's just cut to the chase. We can figure out what happens next today and move on with our lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This whole thing was ridiculous, a complete joke of a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't take it anymore, as a heavy weight settled on my chest, like I was drowning in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you a million times about me and Giselle, but you still don't trust me. Madeline, do you really think I'm that awful?" He dodged my question, trying to turn things around and make it about me not trusting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter laugh bubbled up from my chest. "You want me to trust you when you have another woman's baby on the way, Elliott? I'm just an ordinary woman, and I'm not as magnanimous as you think I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I found myself at a loss for words. It felt pointless to continue this exchange with him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura fiercely shielded Giselle, rendering a paternity test impossible now. By the time Giselle gave birth, everything would be set in stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing would change about the child nestled in Giselle's womb no matter how much Elliott and I fought here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was the case, why waste my energy and succumb to this internal turmoil?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll find another way to unravel this mystery surrounding the child. Trust me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps sensing that I was becoming colder toward him, Elliott once again drew near. Ignoring my resistance, he firmly enveloped me in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His familiar scent washed over me, but what once brought solace now felt like an icy barrier against my skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that the budding affection between Elliott and me would be sabotaged by Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear such intimate contact with him anymore. Each touch left me feeling unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions surged, and I struggled to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you that I won't let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of relenting, Elliott tightened his grip even further. Disregarding my protests, he leaned in as if to kiss me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this time, he provided no explanation, resorting to such tactics to coerce me! How shameless could he get?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fought back with all my might, unable to contain my outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, can you stop this shameless behavior? Do you really think that you can erase everything that happened by doing this to me all the time? Am I nothing more than a tool for you to vent your lust?"</span></p></div>
