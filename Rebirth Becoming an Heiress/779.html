        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly do you mean by 'conservative treatment'?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Work with his memory, don't force him back to reality, don't expose him to additional stress. Ms. Mayers, to put it bluntly, given his current level of dependence on you, it's certain that the best treatment outcome will be achieved if you work with him on his therapy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack looked at me and said bluntly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Jack's words, I felt a ripple of anxiety:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying his memory is stuck before our divorce, and I'm supposed to play along like we're still married. Dr. Jones, I'm sorry, but there's no way I can do that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing my refusal, Jack said with a crestfallen expression:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, if you force him to face reality without his cooperation, I fear it might trigger a nerve shock. This could lead to a clot blockage causing a stroke, which could be life-threatening."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially came to the hospital to care for him, driven by a spirit of humanity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I plan to leave the moment he wakes up, severing all ties with him forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Jack's words have put me in a real pickle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wants me to stick around, to play the part of a sweet couple even though we've already broken up. It's honestly quite tough for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I don't cooperate and he learns the truth, what if he really has a stroke, an accident? I'd be plagued with guilt for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he got hurt because of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me mull it over, Dr. Jones."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself at a loss for words. Seeing this, Jack gave my shoulder a reassuring pat:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to put you in a tough spot, Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wrapping up my chat with Jack, I headed back to the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had already had Barry pack up. The moment I showed up, he couldn't wait to approach me. His deep-set eyes, from the moment I appeared, never left me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What took you so long?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took my hand, cupped my chin, and leaned in, intending to steal a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frantic rush, I thrust my hand out to push him away:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, mind your manners, this is a hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, not a care in the world, still looking at me with a gaze full of affection:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to just make an impact, I want to amplify it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't mince his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, he covered my mouth with a swiftness that was as sudden as a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his tongue brushed against my lips, I was caught off guard, flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively jerked my face from side to side, but there was no escaping him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was dominant and overbearing, leaving me no room to breathe. His hand hooked around the back of my head, leaving me with no escape, no place to hide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss was deep, lingering. Each second felt like an eternity, as if a century had passed in its wake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until I nearly suffocated, biting down hard on his tongue, that Elliott finally let me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stumbled back a few paces. Clutching my nearly swollen-kissed lips, I bellowed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, have you lost your mind? What the hell are you doing, you bastard? Did you even bother to ask for my consent?"</span></p></div>
