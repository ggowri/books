        <h1>Chapter 339 Nervous</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took me to my house. I got out of the car, drove my car from the garage, and went directly to Paige's home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was contacting with Paige all along the way. When I arrived at her door, she had already packed her things. She stood at the door of the community and waited for me with her bag in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing my car, she immediately got into it, put down the seat and nervously held my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do? Some bloodshot comes out. I'm so scared. Madeline, the baby is fine, right? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense. Let's go to the hospital and see what the doctor would say. What has happened to you? Why are you bleeding?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nervousness also increased my nervousness. So I quickly drove to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mention that. Philip is such an idiot. He insisted on having sex with me in the morning. I thought it would be fine, so I accepted him. But as soon as he left, I had a stomach ache and found that I was bleeding when I got out of the toilet. I'm so scared that I will die now. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Paige was grabbing my arm, she also covered her chest. She was so nervous that her voice trembled, which clearly showed that she cared much about this child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Philip now? How can he just let you stay alone? Does he care about you? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard what she said, I became so angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He goes on a business trip and is on the plane now. His phone also turns off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was so angry that she cursed Phillip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to speed up and dash to the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital, we immediately went to find Fiona's colleagues to have a body check.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was three months pregnant. The doctor gave her a B-mode ultrasound check and told us that she did have some signs of threatened abortion, but she needed to go home and rest for a few days. The doctor also prescribed some medicine for her and told her not to have sex in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ensuring that there was no big problem with the baby, Paige was finally relieved for a while. She subconsciously touched her belly and muttered, "Baby, it is lucky that you're fine. Don't worry, I won't let your damn father touch me anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this scene, I was fully touched by Paige, who was going to be a mother from a passionate and free-spirited girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time flies so fast. In a blink of an eye, you will be a mother. Oh, by the way, do your parents know about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my words, Paige looked sad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet. If I tell my dad that I am pregnant out of wedlock, my dad will probably break my legs. Philip hasn't told his parents yet. He said he didn't find the right time. I don't know if he is perfunctory with me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was complaining to me, her gaze suddenly paused, and her eyes became complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Seeing her changes, I quickly asked suspiciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tugged on my sleeve and lowered her voice with her hands pointing forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at those two women, one of them seems to be Laura."</span></p></div>
