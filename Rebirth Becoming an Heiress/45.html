        <h1>Chapter 45 Prank</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An evil thought arose in my mind, and a faint smile couldn't help but play at the corner of my lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started pretending to cooperate with him, while subconsciously moving towards the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed my change and doubt flickered in his eyes. Seizing this opportunity, I broke free from his grasp and pointed toward the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly understood, and a hint of profound meaning appeared on his face, accompanied by a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, do you want to play tricks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is indeed a master in the realm of love, always creating excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly lifted me up around the waist and carried me into the bathroom, placing me directly on the toilet. Then he passionately kissed me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he had already fallen into a state of extreme confusion and infatuation, while my mind was unusually clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took advantage of his inattention and found the opportunity to reach for the position of the showerhead. Then, I suddenly stood up and quickly turned on the faucet, aiming the showerhead at Elliott's head. Without saying a word, I sprayed him down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you needed some cold water to wake up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted and quickly bounced away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you were drugged, don't blame me, I didn't mean to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about it tonight, I would never let you touch me. Just be patient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The showerhead had turned into a weapon in my hands at that moment. I aimed it at his head and, while turning the water flow to the maximum, I shouted loudly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he like this before, holding the shower head and pouring water on my head aggressively?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he say before that he would never touch me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph, I didn't care about letting you touch me now, I would rather you stay as far away from me as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sprayed him without any resistance. He leaned against the wall, completely disheveled, with his whole body soaked. Both of his hands were holding his face, unable to open his eyes, and he didn't even have time to care about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sprayed at him like this for at least a minute or so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the cold water splashed on him, he gradually regained consciousness, and the flush on his face slowly faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have finally snapped out of the chaos, and suddenly, he lifted his head and looked at me with a cold and angry gaze, his eyes filled with boundless resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look, it's so scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that if I didn't run away, it seemed like it would be too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and shouted my name, his hands clenched tightly, standing under the cold water, his whole body emitting a chilling sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, this is what you forced me to do. Who made you drink your mother's soup late at night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately threw the shower head in my hand, shouting as I flew out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how Elliott would react to me after he woke up, but this prank gave me an indescribable satisfaction. I quickly went to the guest room and locked the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't care how uncomfortable he was tonight, as long as I was comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt no guilt at all, on the contrary, I lay down on the guest bed and soon fell asleep peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It doesn't matter to me whether Elliott can't sleep tonight or if he will blame me and be angry with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slept soundly and even had a dream. In the dream, Elliott turned into a begging little dog, wagging its tail and seeking affection from me. I desperately fed it snacks and kept shouting, "Elliott is so good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dream I had was so magical and relieving that even when I woke up, I still felt a bit unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I crawled out of bed, I suddenly felt a little guilty thinking about how I had played a mean prank on Elliott last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously glanced at the time and it was already past nine in the morning. At this time, he should have already left, right?</span></p></div>
