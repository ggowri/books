        <h1>Chapter 698 Interrogation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had just opened his mouth when Elliott walked up to us and said, "What a coincidence, you guys are also here for dinner. Mr. Brown, long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually indifferent and arrogant Elliott surprised everyone by taking the initiative to greet Marcus this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paused for a moment, then politely stood up and extended his hand to Elliott. </span><span>"Mr. Bryant, long time no see. Are you also dining here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I heard this restaurant just opened, so I came to try it out. How about you, do you also like French cuisine?" Elliott's tone was casual, without a hint of deliberate intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have a relatively mild taste. Are you dining with friends?" Marcus politely inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ate with my assistant. I ordered a lot of dishes, but couldn't finish them all. If you don't mind, why don't we share them?" Elliott suddenly suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to be able to stay calm, but as soon as Elliott said those words, my mood instantly turned sour. I coldly replied, "There's no need for that, Mr. Bryant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My reaction seemed to be within Elliott's expectations. He showed no emotions and instead said, "You don't have to be polite with me. It's rare for me to meet Mr. Brown, so I'll take care of the bill. Barry, tell the waiter to bring all the dishes we ordered to this table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott not only contradicted me, but also paid no attention to my reaction at all. He made a decision on his own and, without any hesitation, sat right next to me and gave instructions to Barry as if I didn't exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart sank suddenly, and I slammed the fork heavily on the table, sounding very displeased. "Elliott, have you asked for our opinions before doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, I don't think you would mind, would you?" Elliott pursed his lips and looked at Marcus, shamelessly appearing indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively looked at me, with a troubled expression and a hint of embarrassment, unsure of what to say for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately got up. "Mr. Brown doesn't mind, but I do! Elliott, if you want to eat here, we're leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just stood up when, unexpectedly, Elliott grabbed my hand in front of Marcus and said, "I know you're still mad at me, but can you give me a little face in front of Mr. Brown?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone and manner of speaking made it sound as if we were still a couple, and I was just throwing a tantrum at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I discovered that this person had truly made up their mind to abandon their previous high posture and became shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose to selectively forget certain things, but I haven't forgotten. Every single detail of his and Giselle's relationship is like a scar, blocking my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and rolled my eyes. "Elliott, respect is earned. You are the esteemed president of Bryant Group. Are you really going to continue acting like a scoundrel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression remained indifferent as my verbal attacks felt like punches on cotton. "We all know each other, so what's wrong with having a meal together? Madeline, have you reached a point where you even detest having a meal with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his tone, there was a hint of humility, and at the same time, he gazed at me with deep eyes filled with love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look, as if it had been hurt, seemed a bit innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered and said, "How much I despise you, you should know better than anyone. Let go, I can't eat this meal anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Marcus being present, I still didn't give Elliott any face. I coldly shook off his hand and then bid Marcus farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the atmosphere had already become awkward to a certain extent, Marcus had a troubled expression on his face and awkwardly said, "Madeline, Mr. Bryant is being so polite, would you like to sit down and grab a bite?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I furrowed my brow and looked at Elliott, my eyes filled with anger. "I don't have any have appetite and I don't know what you are planning now. We have nothing to do with each other now, Elliott. You really don't need to keep bothering me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat in his seat, his face that was emotionless just a moment ago now faintly showing anger.</span></p></div>
