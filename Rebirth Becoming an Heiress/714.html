        <h1>Chapter 714 Hidden Crisis</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me clarify first, this time I didn't poach Bryant Group. I didn't know you were in negotiations before I signed with Director Lewis. If you don't believe me, you can ask Director Lewis." I didn't want him to misunderstand me, so before he could speak, I took the initiative to defend myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott appeared to be indifferent, he looked at me lightly, as if his gaze had already seen everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Since you have already signed the contract, I don't have much to say. However, I have a few words that I would like to speak to you privately," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott said this, Dalton quickly said, "I happen to be heading to the airport. I have booked a flight back at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. So Mr. Bryant, Ms. Mayers, you can continue your conversation, I'll leave first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that the filming progress over at Dalton's side was very rushed, and he couldn't afford any delay in his schedule. So, I didn't try to keep him for long and quickly said goodbye to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dalton left, Elliott went with me to where I had parked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the difficulty of finding parking nearby, I had to park my car at a distant location this time. Therefore, he walked with me to the destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was spring, and the phoenix trees on both sides of the road were budding with fresh and tender leaves. The streets were filled with a vibrant spring atmosphere. I noticed </span><span>that Elliott was dressed lightly, wearing only a thin black sweater paired with a black t-shirt. He also wore slim black trousers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, we rarely walked together on the road like this, so I felt a bit awkward and just hoped to reach the place where I parked my car quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to tell me? Just say it. It's fine." Seeing Elliott remain silent, I took the initiative to speak, unintentionally sounding a bit impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott walked quietly beside me, with one hand in his pocket and his eye-catching limited edition Vacheron Constantin watch on his wrist. "I came over here to persuade you not to get involved in this matter. The forces behind this film are quite complex. Unfortunately, I arrived a step too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's calm tone surprised me. Initially, I thought he would be angry like before, thinking that I was competing with him for business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to come and persuade me about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just about involving Mexico, right? I know the situation there is complicated, but it's just a movie, so it shouldn't be a big problem," I said lightly. And the reason I think so is because, based on my memories from the previous life, I am confident that although this movie will go through some twists and turns, it will eventually be successfully released, after all, the subject matter of this movie, although sensitive, is in line with popular taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the power involved behind the movie... in my opinion, I am just a behind-the-scenes investor, and the investment of 200 million is not a significant proportion of the total investment in this film. I think the problem should not be big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not as simple as you think. We have already had professionals assess the situation, but during our evaluation, we received warnings from certain hidden forces. Madeline, I don't know how your contract is written, but if the cost of breaching it is not significant, I would advise you to cut your losses in a timely manner," Elliott said to me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made me feel a little nervous... I am aware of Elliott's caution in his career. He believes that adventurous things must have extremely unstable factors. Otherwise, he wouldn't pay much attention to them in general.</span></p></div>
