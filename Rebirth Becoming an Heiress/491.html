        <h1>Chapter 491 Divorce Certificate</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn enjoyed his breakfast while raising his head and quipped, "Of course, I know Madeline longer time than you. Even if you want to be the baby's godfather, we have to abide by the first-come-first-served principle, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was usually mature and steady, but when he was with Quinn, he would always become playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing them fighting over the godfather position, Lily couldn't stop laughing. "Both of you can be the godfather. Whoever becomes the baby's godfather, the baby will have more love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I'm just pregnant. It's still a long time before I give birth. By then, whoever the baby smiles at first will be his godfather. Is this okay?" I joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, there's no need to guess. The baby must have smiled at me first." Quinn winked confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so sure. As the old saying goes, there are more benefits by living closer," Marcus retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sneered disdainfully, "Bah! Can't I afford a house? After Christmas, I will buy a house nearby." Watching the two of them arguing like a child, Lily and I laughed. At this moment, the doorbell rang at our door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so early. Who could it be?" Lily muttered, walked over, and opened the door. After a while, she came in carrying a package.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's for you. It is Christmas. Who will send a package here?" Lily handed me the package with a confused look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was puzzled. Usually, my packages were delivered to the office and rarely to my home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the package curiously. To my surprise, it was a legal document and several pieces of paper inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked when I saw the words "divorce certificate" on the legal document. My body trembled involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that I didn't need to show up at all. Elliott couldn't wait to go through the divorce procedures and sent them to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Christmas day. What a heavy gift! My heart seemed to have fallen into an ice cellar the moment I saw the divorce certificate, and I couldn't help but feel cold all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn asked as he walked over curiously. He picked up the document from my hand. After just one glance, he stood up angrily and scolded, "Elliott is too much! It's Christmas. Couldn't he wait until the other day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lily heard Quinn's curse, she immediately came over, took the document, and looked. Her face changed instantly, and her tears couldn't stop flowing. "How did Madeline offend the Bryant family? Why are they so cruel? They won't even let her have a peaceful Christmas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it! Since they have chosen to do this on Christmas day, we can only accept it. Never mind. Are they afraid Madeline won't be able to get married in the future?" At this time, Austin's growl came from behind. He was still in his pajamas and had obviously just woken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was looking at the divorce certificate blankly. In my mind, I couldn't help but think of the photo that Giselle uploaded with Elliott in it, smiling charmingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he had already made up his mind when he left that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whatever, I was determined to get a divorce, anyway. That ending was nothing more than a matter of time. For me, it was a relief that Elliott could let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pretending to be calm, taking out those papers from the package, and found the divorce agreement I had sent him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He signed on the document and attached a check for 1.6 million dollars, but he had not left a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that 1.6 million dollars was the divorce compensation he gave me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't care about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money was not important to me. I could now earn it entirely on my own. So, I crumpled the check without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was looking at that crumpled check and feeling an inexplicable sense of humiliation. Again, I tore the check into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I took a picture of the shredded check and sent it to Elliott. [Goodbye, ex-husband.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for any reply from him, I immediately blocked all his contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to cut off contact with him entirely just like that. Everything was over.</span></p></div>
