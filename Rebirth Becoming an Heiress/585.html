        <h1>Chapter 585 Break In</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that Mr. Bryant's ex-wife? What's she doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, they seemed like a perfect match. I wonder why they suddenly got divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you hear? I heard it was because of the relationship between Mr. Bryant and Giselle from the planning department. She hasn't been coming to work recently, right? I heard she's even pregnant and now living in the Bryant Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? How come I haven't heard anything about this? Why would Mr. Bryant be interested in her? I think his ex-wife is much prettier than her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. Have you seen the latest issue of Lotus Forum? It's the speech given by Mr. Bryant's ex-wife, she was absolutely brilliant, a role model for us young people to learn from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I made my way towards the elevator, the surrounding discussions filled my ears clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended not to hear anything and walked straight to the VIP elevator reserved for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A security guard extended his hand to stop me, saying, "Madam, please hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot him a cold glare. "Who are you stopping? Do you know who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback but insisted, "Madam, this is Mr. Bryant's private elevator. You can take another one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I say no? Call Barry now, tell him Madeline is here and demands to be picked up!" I arrogantly stated, staring him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I had mentioned Barry's name directly, he hurriedly dialed Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Barry descended into the elevator, sweating profusely, and approached me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you... How come you're here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken, it should be 'former Mrs. Bryant.' I'm here to speak with Elliott about something. Is he in?" I inquired directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry, still looking fearful, replied, "Mr. Bryant is a bit busy at the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, we've known each other for so long, can you stop trying to deceive me with this act? I'm going up now, and if you dare stop me, give it a shot!" I challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I wouldn't dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry couldn't even lift his head and promptly pressed the elevator button, gesturing gentlemanly for me to enter first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smirked disdainfully, walked into Elliott's designated elevator, pressed the button for the top floor, and arrived at Elliott's office door shortly after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing open the door to Elliott's office, I found him seated in a large boss chair. He was frowning, deeply engrossed in studying the documents on his desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked up and was taken aback, asking in astonishment, "How come you're here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged off my coat and bag and sat directly in front of his desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at him, I said, "Elliott, I never expected the Bryant family to play such a ruthless game of betrayal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words caused a slight change in Elliott's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of confusion appeared on Elliott's face as he set aside the documents and calmly asked, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p></div>
