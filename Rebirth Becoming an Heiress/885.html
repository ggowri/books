        <h1>Chapter 885: Have You Two Made Up Yet?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After filling my belly, I set down my fork and knife, grinning as I asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He twitched his lips slightly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throughout my life, I've always been the center of attention. Do you know why I never noticed you before? Because there were too many women like you, admiring me from afar. Some women tried every trick in the book to seduce me, some wrote me love letters and called me relentlessly, and some even threatened to jump off buildings for me. That's why I used to be put off by overly assertive women. But now, it seems, karma has caught up with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When people say these things, they might just be showing off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I do believe Elliott when he says this. It's the truth. No matter where he goes, he has countless admirers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I married him, countless women were green with envy. In my past life, after Giselle sought revenge on me, some crazed women even went to the extent of splashing red paint on me, all in the name of retribution.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't karma. What you owe me, you're naturally bound to repay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed, my joy growing ever more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm all in now. As long as you don't ignore me, I'm willing to do anything for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say he loved me outright, but every word he uttered was laced with love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I heard this building is yours, are you giving it to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I winked at him, teasingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, he actually took it seriously, saying with all earnestness:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You like this place? Alright, I'll have Barry transfer the ownership first thing tomorrow. This building will be registered under your name."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, his gaze devoid of any hint of hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems he truly cares about me now, willing to give me anything I desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just kidding, don't take it seriously."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chowing down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, we walked out of the restaurant once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had already hauled our pile of purchases to the car. Meanwhile, Elliott and I continued to leisurely stroll around for a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stepped into a boutique, my heart always having a soft spot for those unique trinkets. Once again, I found myself picking out a bunch of pricey baubles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott was more than willing to foot the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pick, he happily pays from behind. The way he seems willing to buy me anything makes me can't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a day of gallivanting, I was truly beat, especially in these high heels.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't go on. Seeing this, Elliott squatted down in front of me, signaling for me to climb onto his back. He carried me the rest of the way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mall was bustling with people, and Elliott's face was particularly noticeable. I felt a bit hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott simply scooped me up, hoisting me onto his back, and unabashedly carried me down the elevator. We strolled through the mall corridors just like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel countless people snapping pictures of us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if someone uploads these photos online? Wouldn't that be another blow for Quinn?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wanted to get off Elliott's back, but he just wouldn't let me down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a notification popped up on my phone. It was a message from Paige in our trio's besties group chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige swiftly screenshotted a freshly baked piece of gossip news. The headline read something along the lines of "Bryant Group's CEO parades around the mall with his wife, flaunting their love and spending big bucks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a string of shocked emojis, Paige followed up with a barrage of question marks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was equally shocked, she immediately shot me a message asking:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, are you and Elliott back together? Are you guys flaunting your love?"</span></p></div>
