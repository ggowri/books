        <h1>Chapter 308 Control the Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting was over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the only two people left in the large conference room were Jade and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade looked me up and down and then said, "Madeline, I realized that you seem to have a lot of hostility towards me now. Why is that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I'm just trying to solve the problem. I'm not targeting you. You don't think too much about it," I said with a small smile, looking at her and avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly put a hand on my shoulder. Jade then leaned in close to my ear and said, "I hope I'm overthinking this. But Madeline, running a company isn't as easy as you think. If you don't even trust me, do you trust outsiders more?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew she was still trying to convince me. It's just that nowadays, I'm no longer the same person who was foolishly and, with hindsight, blinded by her in my last life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, how could I not trust you? You just need to set your position right and work well for the Glory Group, and I won't treat you badly," I said hypocritically. My purpose was to deliberately make her understand that she was just working for my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade probably didn't expect me to be so arrogant. She was so angry that she stopped pretending, and her voice was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her overbearing demeanor and deliberately teased, "You've gotten enough these past few years. You know how many properties you have acquired in Hoswich and abroad. I hope you won't be greedy. It wouldn't be good if, in the end, we all fall out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade probably never dreamed that I would say those words. She looked at me, and her eyes changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those properties are...earned by me by virtue of my investment and have nothing to do with the Glory Group. Madeline, do you think Mr. Mayers' car accident has anything to do with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't mention the car accident, but Jade suddenly took the initiative to bring it up. This made me believe more and more that the matter was related to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think so. However, I will investigate this matter clearly. If it's really someone who intends to harm my father, I will not let her go!" I finished speaking, then did not want to say anything more to Jade, so I turned around and left the conference room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't realize that I've given my whole heart to the Glory Group, yet you don't believe me so much! You will regret it!" Jade was furious behind me, so she yelled furiously at my back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly left the conference room without stopping for a moment because I knew that I had more and more important things to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing I needed to do was to get hold of evidence of Jade's massive embezzlement of funds from the company. In this regard, I had already grasped some of it in Louis City through the financial statements.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached out to Katrina again and asked her to cooperate with me in investigating the whereabouts of all the projects that Jade had handled in the past few years, and Katrina agreed to do so without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, I asked Adam to make sure that Do Not Love would do well in theaters and that the project would do well enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I got everything organized, it was a week later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a week of running back and forth between the hospital and the Glory Group, not getting much sleep, and not having much of an appetite, so I had lost a lot of weight again without realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The good thing was, after continuous efforts, my first project, Do Not Love, was finally successfully released and started airing on a certain TV station.</span></p></div>
