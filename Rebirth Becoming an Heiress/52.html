        <h1>Chapter 52 Astonishment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it just a game to meet and have fun?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was just a game, how can we explain why he repeatedly took action and spent money on those women?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no way of knowing, nor did I want to know too many details. I said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's just a playacting or a genuine display of emotions, it doesn't matter to me anyway. Mr. Woods, I am going to change my clothes, are you sure you want to stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to have just noticed that in this VIP dressing room, there was an incredibly gorgeous white gown, and professional stylists were already waiting in the dressing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the first sight of the formal dress, he instinctively exclaimed, then quickly waved his hand and took a step back, awkwardly smiling as he said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't waste your time. I'll be outside to hold the door for you, let me know when you're ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The changing room had a lock, so he didn't need to lock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became more and more unsure of what he was thinking. How could he suddenly be so attentive to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also didn't feel like thinking too much. With the help of two shop assistants, I changed into a white dress and then sat in front of the mirror, carefully dressing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of professional hairstylists and makeup artists, my hairstyle and makeup were quickly done. This time, the makeup and hairstyle were much more elaborate and careful than before in the clothing store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they helped me tidy up, I checked myself carefully in the mirror. By the time I was ready, the time was already very close to the start of the dinner party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door was opened at this moment, and I walked out from inside, holding my skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood at the door, and when he saw me appear, the expression on his face was beyond astonishment. After a while, he finally uttered, "..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, I didn't know you looked so beautiful in a formal dress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a compliment, but coming out of Quinn's mouth, it sounded a bit insincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. I said, "It's okay, not ugly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only is she not ugly, she is simply a fairy descending to earth. Elliott leaving such a beautiful wife like you to engage in ambiguous relationships outside is truly blind and ignorant. I will definitely scold him when I see him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't help but make fun of Elliott while gentlemanly extending his hand towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I placed my hand on his arm, and he supported me as we walked towards the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His white suit today perfectly complemented my white dress, making people along the way mistakenly think that we were a couple, and they cast admiring glances at us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn actually looked pretty good, but he and Elliott were not the same type. He had a bit more brightness in his handsomeness compared to Elliott, and he had an extra touch of rebelliousness in his temperament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my impression, in the previous life, he, including Elliott and two other friends, were particularly nice to Giselle and not interested in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, for some reason, Quinn changed so much. He treated me exceptionally well, but he seemed to have little feelings towards Giselle, who appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn helped me into the banquet venue, and at this time, the guests had already arrived and taken their seats. On the stage, the dancers had also started warming up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat in the center, and as soon as he saw me being supported by Quinn from a distance, his face changed instantly. He immediately strode towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and immediately slapped Quinn's hand away, then arrogantly linked my hand onto his arm, while also giving Quinn a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I dead? Do you have to replace me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were used to teasing each other, so when Quinn saw him looking jealous, she couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I helped you support your wife out of goodwill, and you still speak to me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I appreciate your kindness, but please stay away from my wife, there won't be a next time."</span></p></div>
