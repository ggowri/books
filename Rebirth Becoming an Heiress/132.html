        <h1>Chapter 132 Completely Sober</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel through his eyes that he had no ulterior motives at all. He genuinely wished from the bottom of his heart for me to live a better life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words cleared the fog for me and made me think clearly about many things. I instantly freed myself from tonight's emotional turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized that I was so out of control tonight because I started caring about Elliott again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I cared, I said those words that I now regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I had already managed to control my emotions and feelings well in front of him, but tonight, I almost ruined it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was right, indifference is the best weapon to retaliate against someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I had already sworn that I would never fall in love with Elliott again in this lifetime, I must strengthen my inner self and not let anything break my determination, returning to the hysterical state I was in before because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. So now I just want to focus on my work. I have already filed for divorce with him, but he doesn't want to divorce me at the moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I was touched by his sincerity, I also truthfully expressed my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you think he didn't agree?" he asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I never naively thought that he couldn't live without me. He didn't agree mainly because of the family's reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a bitter smile and then said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suddenly laughed and opened another bottle of beer. He tapped the glass in my hand and said, "Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I am relieved that you can think this way. Don't ask me why, as his best friend, I am on your side instead of his. I cannot tell you the reason right now. But what I want to tell you is that a girl must love herself first before loving a man. A woman who doesn't love herself is not attractive in a man's eyes. Keep going in the way you are now, and make yourself better and better, so that one day he will regret losing you. That's what you should do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's eyes held encouragement, and the depth in his words made me almost believe that he had also been reborn. Otherwise, how could he have undergone such a significant transformation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost couldn't help but want to ask him this question, but then I thought that being reborn is undoubtedly something that happens in novels in anyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the protagonist, if it were me instead, I would never believe it, and how could Quinn also coincidentally be reborn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should not be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I didn't ask any further, but Quinn's words completely woke me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew what to do. You will take me back to my parents' house later, and from now on, I won't be impulsive like tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and smiled at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, ever since I was reborn, I haven't been able to share many of my inner thoughts with anyone because no one has had such an experience, so no one would understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from Quinn's words, I have felt more than once that he understood me, he would always appear in my world at the right time, giving me strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good," Quinn smiled with relief, he affectionately patted my head, "If my silly friend ever truly cares about you, and falls in love with you, I will bless you both. But if he continues to not appreciate you, I will also help you beat him up! Don't worry, I will always be by your side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was deeply moved when I heard his words. The darkness in my heart gradually dissipated under the comfort of his words, and in its place, a stronger determination emerged than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit that his words did indeed heal me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, my phone suddenly rang, and when I saw "Elliott" displayed on the screen, I hesitated whether to answer. But unexpectedly, Quinn snatched my phone and answered the call.</span></p></div>
