        <h1>Chapter 241 Check-up</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively looked at Elliott, silently signaling for him to handle the situation. Clearly caught off guard by Cormac's request, Elliott quickly responded, "Cormac, we're still young. There's no need for a check-up. Madeline and I will make sure to act promptly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cormac's stubborn nature was even stronger than Elliott's. He insisted, "Why is there no need? Only through the check-up will you both understand why Madeline hasn't gotten pregnant after three years of marriage. This is settled. You two are going to have the check-up right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac's emotions were running high as he spoke, causing him to break into a fit of intense coughing. His face was turning red, startling both Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, just listen to Cormac and go for the check-up. If Madeline receives treatment, it will help her conceive faster."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole intervened, approaching us while helping Cormac pat his back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at the same time, I could distinctly feel her casting a sinister glance in my direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with malice. I suspected that it was Nicole and Giselle who had advised Cormac to request the fertility tests for Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the furious expression on Nicole's face after I slapped Giselle, I suddenly understood everything. I couldn't help but shoot Nicole a fierce look, and our eyes locked for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed visibly uneasy and averted her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both must go for the check-up today, understand? This is not a joke. It concerns the Bryant family's legacy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac finally regained his composure, his tone still firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a refined-looking doctor in a white coat walked in. After greeting Cormac, he turned to Elliott and me, saying, "Mr. Bryant, Mrs. Bryant, I've arranged the examination process for you both. It will be quick. Let's go, I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that this was the authoritative expert Cormac had mentioned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cormac, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely unprepared, and only Elliott and I knew the reason behind my inability to conceive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly being asked to undergo such tests felt humiliating, and I felt a strong resistance within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott quickly gave me a signal, and in a calm tone, he said, "Since Grandpa has arranged it, let's go for the check-up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott clearly didn't want to upset Cormac, so he stood up, took my hand, and hurriedly followed Doctor Louis out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, as soon as Elliott and I followed the doctor to the examination center, we found ourselves swiftly ushered through various medical tests without a chance to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything indeed happened as the doctor had said. The entire process was rapid, taking less than an hour for me to complete all the necessary examinations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enduring a sense of humiliation throughout, I returned to Cormac's room after the check-up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon my return, I noticed that Nicole had already left while Giselle was engaged in a cheerful conversation with Cormac. Elliott sat beside them, wearing a contented expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene appeared harmonious, so much so that as I entered, I felt an unmistakable sense of alienation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending to be composed, I approached Cormac. "Grandpa, I've completed the necessary check-up. The weather outside is lovely. Would you like Elliott and me to take you for a stroll?"</span></p></div>
