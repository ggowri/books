        <h1>Chapter 381 Let Down</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was in a frantic state by now. She pointed at Elliott and cursed loudly, spinning around in the corridor in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched this scene, I suddenly felt it was so ironic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a while ago, I still respected Laura. But now, the way they surrounded Giselle made me seem like a mistress who couldn't bear the light, while Giselle appeared as the daughter-in-law of their Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned weakly against the corner wall, subconsciously clutching my aching chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, it's better not to go up and invite humiliation, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was convinced that Giselle was carrying the child of their Bryant family, so the truth suddenly seemed less important.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head became a mess. Initially, I had fully believed Elliott. But the photo Giselle showed me made everything confusing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott deceive me, or did Giselle set up something?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no way of knowing, feeling suddenly passive, extremely passive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, how is Giselle? Is she okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another commotion at the door of the resuscitation room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned to look and saw that Giselle had been wheeled out by doctors, with Laura, Elliott, and Nicole all crowding around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are some signs of threatened miscarriage. Fortunately, she was brought in on time, and the bleeding has stopped for now, but considering the situation, we'll keep her hospitalized for a week to ensure the pregnancy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's voice sounded familiar, and as I focused, I realized it was Dr. Louis, the one who had conducted tests for Elliott and me last time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good as long as she's okay. It really scared me just now. Dr. Louis, no matter how expensive the medicine, please make sure to protect the child in Giselle's womb."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so shocked that she patted her chest and quickly said to Dr. Louis.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I will do my utmost, please rest assured."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Louis removed his mask and reassured Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pushed Giselle in my direction as they walked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was too preoccupied with worry and didn't notice me. But this time, I couldn't dodge, and she noticed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw me, she squinted instantly, as if understanding something, and immediately pointed at me and said loudly, "I knew Giselle wouldn't bleed for no reason! Giselle, did she push you, was it her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, without distinguishing right from wrong, rushed over and grabbed my collar, accusing me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still, hearing this baseless accusation, feeling even colder inside. I coldly pushed her hand away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go, it wasn't me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slap!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, a loud slap resounded fiercely on my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't you, why were you skulking around here? In my opinion, it's you, you're jealous that Giselle is carrying Elliott's child! You, this woman, are so malicious! I was so good to you before. I must have been blind!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura spoke viciously and insultingly to me. She seemed to have forgotten that, until this moment, I was still her daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her current attitude was so venomous, so ugly, as if she had already regarded me as a thorn in her eye, a constant annoyance, a stumbling block...</span></p></div>
