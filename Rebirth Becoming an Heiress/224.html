        <h1>Chapter 224 Friends Gathering</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott took me to our car without talking to Giselle anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as we got to the car, I immediately pushed his hand away. There was silence again in the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still felt suffocated. The thought of going back with Elliott to Serenity Villa made me feel suffocated even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Paige sent me a message at this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Sweetie, we are having a party again tonight, but you are in Louis City and can't come.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if seeing hope, I immediately replied: [I'm in Hoswich. Where are you? I'll go and find you.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was pleasantly surprised and replied at once: [What? You're back? We are having drinks. Come here.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly replied: [You call me now. I'm with Elliott. Hurry up.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige understood what I meant right away. As soon as I sent the message, she called me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the phone, she deliberately invited me to come see her in a loud voice and said she had something important to tell me. Elliott sat beside me, and I was sure he must have heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, I said calmly, "Paige and Fiona haven't seen me for a long time and asked me to go over and accompany them. You can send me there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to look at me. I could tell he seemed a little unhappy. Still, he said in a deep voice, "Okay, but you have to come back early."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I just wanted to stay away from him and didn't want to argue with him anymore. I responded briefly, "Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told him the address that Paige had sent to me. He drove me there not long after.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately got out of the car and quickly walked into the club. When I pushed open the room door and saw Paige, Fiona, Quinn, and Philip, I felt like a great weight had been lifted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige rushed over to hug me and joked, "Look who's here! It's Madeline, a new businesswoman. It's been half a month since I saw you last time. You're getting cooler and cooler! "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You live a happier life. You can drink together every day. I envy you so much." I smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Paige is the freest among the three of us. She has fun with men every day. I could only hang out at night."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona came up to me and hugged me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Madeline, you are back. You have to have drinks later. I asked the waiter to bring over the bottle of red wine that I've kept secretly here. You three run away tonight. Philip and I will have a drinking contest with you. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn carelessly sat on the sofa, his hands lazily resting on the handle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "The three of us competing against the two of you? Come on. Not a problem for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige got competitive immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She readily said, "Okay. You said that!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stood up and walked out to ask the waiter to get the wine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their happy faces, I felt a lot more relaxed. I hadn't enjoyed drinking for a long time. So, I quickly joined them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of us started playing a dice game. I didn't know if it was because I was in no mood, but I had bad luck and lost easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I knew it, I had drunk several glasses of red wine and became dizzy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that I could no longer drink, I asked them to continue. Then, I played a song and sang.</span></p></div>
