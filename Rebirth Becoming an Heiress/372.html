        <h1>Chapter 372 Her Child</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Elliott's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was standing guard outside the ward like a silent sentinel</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing my gaze towards the door, Quinn instinctively followed my line of sight, only to find Elliott gone from the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, please let him go. I don't want to see him again recently," I pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back on the hospital bed. Recalling Giselle's triumphant declaration of her pregnancy with Elliott's child sent a sharp pang through my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there more to this than meets the eye? Elliott doesn't strike me as the type to juggle two boats," Quinn remarked, his brow furrowed with suspicion. Quinn frowned and said with some suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a weak and bitter smile, I replied, "As long as that woman is Giselle, nothing is impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I couldn't fully explain the complexities of my past life to Quinn, I knew better than anyone the inextricable bond between Giselle and Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take some rest, and I'll go talk to him," Quinn suggested, rising from his seat and patting my shoulder reassuringly before leaving the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone in the hospital room, I stared blankly at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed by confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up my phone, I absentmindedly checked the time, only to realize that more than thirty hours had passed since I fell into a coma.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several unread messages awaited my attention&mdash;Lily's inquiries, Adam's work updates.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and the others had refrained from informing Lily of my condition to spare her worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told her that I had been busy in the past two days, and then promised that I would visit her and Austin soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I replied to Adam's message and asked him to keep an eye on the company when I was not around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when I was about to put down my phone and rest, I received Giselle of text messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel reminder of the life she had effortlessly claimed for herself. The ultrasound photo she sent, accompanied by her taunting message, cut through me like a knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A color ultrasound photo was also sent. In the photo, it was a baby that had developed arms and legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I want to show you the child of Elliott. Isn't it cute?] She sent that vicious message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I stared at the screen, I could almost feel the smugness emanating from Giselle as she sent those messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had effortlessly obtained the child I had longed for with such determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Elliott's parents were already aware of Giselle's pregnancy, hence their sudden change in attitude towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was already three months pregnant&mdash;an undeniable testament to her resilience and cunning nature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the sharp pain in my heart and the threat of emotional collapse, I repeated a mantra to myself, "Madeline, you must remain strong. Don't allow anyone, especially Giselle, to bring you down."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each repetition, my tumultuous emotions began to subside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly composed a message to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Elliott didn't say it was his child.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubts lingered in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't accept that Elliott lied to me about Giselle joining the business trip. But, can he be so frank and calm if Giselle was telling the truth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding onto a glimmer of hope, I couldn't shake the feeling that everything was just another one of Giselle's manipulative schemes.</span></p></div>
