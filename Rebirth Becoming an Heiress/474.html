        <h1>Chapter 474 Reminiscing About the Past</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time was much longer than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flowed quietly, and I held my breath, silently observing Marcus in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't the typical handsome guy, but he had thick eyebrows and big eyes. His physique was sturdy, his eyes sharp, and his lips full. His tanned skin showed he had experienced a lot. Perhaps it was because he had been a soldier; he exuded an air of integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed like a very responsible man. Just sitting beside him made me feel incredibly at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was probably the demeanor that soldiers naturally carried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several minutes, Marcus finally released my hand. He smiled slightly and said, "Nothing serious. I'll prescribe some medicine for you, and you can follow my instructions to ensure the normal development of the fetus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' tone was gentle but confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, I felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Your words make me feel relieved. Marcus, I never imagined I'd reunite with you in this lifetime, let alone become neighbors. It's truly miraculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never imagined it either. The carefree little girl from my memories is now about to become a mother. Do you remember the time when we were desk mates, and you couldn't see the questions written on the blackboard due to your nearsightedness and ended up in tears?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recalled our past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I do. I was so frustrated back then, I almost tore up my notebook. Later, you stopped writing and just handed me your notebook to copy. But because we were slow, we didn't finish on time and got punished to stand outside the classroom. It was quite amusing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished, we both burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on those little moments we overlooked at the time; we realized how those days were both simple and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, you hated math class. You never paid attention, then panicked when you couldn't solve the problems and pestered me to explain. I remember one time during math class, you secretly wrote a note, didn't show me, crumpled it up, and threw it out the window, challenging me to pick it up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus reminisced, and what he said jogged my memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were both young at the time. Perhaps because we had been desk mates for so long, and he always helped me, I gradually developed feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to write down my secrets in my notebook, tear them up, and write them again. That time, for some reason, I wrote "I like you" on the note but was afraid Marcus would see it, so I threw it out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, outside the window was a dense pine forest. A thick wall separated the school from the pine forest, and there were protective bars on the windows. The reason I jokingly told Marcus to fetch it was because I was certain he wouldn't be able to retrieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we were so naive back then. I used to get inexplicably mad at you and ignore you. You never knew why I was upset but would always bring me various snacks and toys, which led to one instance where the teacher caught you, and you got punished to stand outside again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I spoke, I couldn't help but laugh again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, I never expected you to remember those things. Actually, I went to pick up that note later, and I saw what was written on it..."</span></p></div>
