        <h1>Chapter 406 Dark Figure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is what you said today true?" I smirked and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said so many things today. Which one are you referring to?" Quinn replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mentioned that the core components Glory Group needs are not exclusively owned by the Bryant Group. Are you sure? As far as I know, only Bryant Group holds the patent for that," I questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you mean that." Quinn finally realized what I was talking about. "While Bryant Group indeed holds the patent, but with technological advancements, there are now other alternatives available on the market. Are you thinking of ending the cooperation with Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Quinn's explanation, I began to grasp the situation. I nodded, saying, "Yes, considering the current circumstances, I'd rather not have more dealings with Bryant Group. If we can find other partners, it would be better to end the cooperation with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They never stop to think, do they? If it wasn't for your family's timely investment of two billion dollars, Bryant Group wouldn't be as successful as they are today. Frankly speaking, Laura has gone too far this time," Quinn voiced his discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, "People tend to be ungrateful. I can't blame them, as it's because of my own foolishness and stubbornness in the past that led to this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for my insistence on marrying Elliott and having my dad help the Bryant family through their crisis, Glory Group wouldn't have such a big financial hole to fill now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those were all in the past, and they were all done deeds anyway. The key was to move forward step by step without regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not in business, but I've heard some information from my sister before. I'll ask her for more details and let you know if there's any news," Quinn offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or you could introduce me to your sister. From what you've said, I'd like to meet her." I suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I only caught a glimpse of Quinn's sister, her cool and stunning demeanor left a deep impression on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was well aware of my shortcomings in the business world, and Quinn's sister, who had been in the business for a long time, could teach me about a lot of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure? She's a big shot in this industry. Do you think you can handle her?" Quinn looked somewhat surprised, turning to me with a smile that was hard to read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, only if you're willing to connect us both though." I smiled and winked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem, I'll arrange it once she's in a better mood these days," Quinn readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, after returning home, I took a quick shower and immediately sat in front of the computer, searching for information on the supplier of those core components.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the information I found on the internet, I quickly found a company called Infinite Precision. They had just developed a new product, the RV motor, claiming it could replace the current NM motor on the market. And the NM motor was the core motor provided by Bryant Group to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Infinite Precision... The name sounded familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to search for more information about this company online, but their information was very limited. The data I found online was also very scarce, and I couldn't get enough understanding of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recording the information I found online, I sent it to Isaac and asked him to find more comprehensive information about this company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Busy times always passed quickly, and before I knew it, it was already midnight.</span></p></div>
