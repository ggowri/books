        <h1>Chapter 832: Stay With Me</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A billion bucks?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like Elliott is planning to venture into the pharmaceutical market next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing to throw away our long-negotiated partnership over a single joke, then I'm at a loss for words."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott still chose to stand by my side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Lisa was seething with anger. She glared at Elliott, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Mr. Bryant, I hope you won't regret the decision you've made. After all, there are plenty of people who are fond of Mrs. Bryant. Whether she'll always be yours... well, that remains to be seen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa sure is sharp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to call me "Ms. Mayers", but now she refers to me as "Mrs. Bryant".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, while Elliott was unconscious, she had spent enough time by his side to fully understand the relationship and situation between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dared to speak so boldly, clearly aware of the current situation between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words, Lisa, bag in hand, stormed out in a huff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression was nonchalant, his gaze steady. He casually remarked, "Everyone, eat up. Don't let this seafood feast go to waste."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a big client of yours, you don't need to upset her on my account. Elliott, why don't you go smooth things over with her?" I felt guilty that Elliott had upset Lisa for my sake, so I quickly tried to intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Alexis and Philip, he affectionately pinched my cheek, "Business isn't as important as you. I won't work with anyone who disrespects you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I saw my existence clearly reflected in the depths of Elliott's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seems like his heart and eyes are filled with nothing but me. He's willing to disregard everything for me, even the business deal he's been negotiating for so long.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis and Philip were clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Elliott they knew was just like the one I remembered - cold, always putting clients first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he put me before his career... Yet, ironically, he did so because he was currently suffering from amnesia.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to wake up one day, would he regret making such a decision?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meal was polished off in no time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I wanted to bolt. However, I found myself yanked into Elliott's car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you're planning to move back in with your parents again. If you keep doing that, they'll start thinking I'm treating you badly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we got in the car, Elliott swiveled me around to face him, then gently kissed my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? It's just that my parents' house is close to Glory Group, so I..." I instinctively tried to push him away, desperately defending myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay with me. I can only sleep soundly when you're by my side. I promise, I won't touch you unless you want me to. Deal?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hooked his finger under my chin, his eyes brimming with desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His weary eyes, in the end, stirred a hint of pity in me. So, I nodded, "Alright. I can keep you company, but let's get one thing straight - one blanket each, and if you dare to pull anything, I swear I'll never do this again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm just going along with Elliott's treatment, I'm not interested in having a relationship with him.</span></p></div>
