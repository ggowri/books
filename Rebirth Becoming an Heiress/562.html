        <h1>Chapter 562 Met Him Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman in this world did not desire to be recognized, understood, and cherished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter if this recognition came from a lover, a relative, or a friend. We longed for the feeling of being valued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I was affected by the pregnancy hormones or I was too moved, I cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't expect that his words would make me cry, so he hurriedly took out a tissue and wiped away my tears. Then he comforted me, "Why did you cry suddenly? I didn't realize you were so emotional before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because of you." I wiped my tears and said angrily, "Didn't you hate me before? Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked about the confusion in my heart, however, Quinn refused to tell the truth as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need a reason to be nice to you. Besides, you are already so miserable. If I don't treat you better, won't you be even more sad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to fool me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he wouldn't tell me the truth, so I didn't ask any more questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter brought our orders to the table at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This store was very thoughtful and offered soup, many dishes, and desserts. All kinds of dishes were placed together, looking particularly exquisite, no less good than the food in a big store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the dishes, took a photo, and posted it on social media. Then I ate with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this kind of weather, it was great to drink this tonic soup. Since I took the medicine prepared by Marcus for me, my pregnancy reactions gradually eased, and my appetite gradually improved. Before I knew it, I had finished two bowls of soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pregnant women were prone to frequent urination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway through the meal, I hurried to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since my divorce, no matter where I went, Elliott would follow me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Sylvia became the woman next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Giselle was still in the hospital trying to preserve her fetus, he hooked up with his old lover again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, I suddenly understood that everything in the past was fake, and no one was irreplaceable for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt glad I had escaped from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes lingered on them briefly, then quickly turned away. Then I walked past them without looking at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't she your ex-wife? Ms. Mayers, what a coincidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia caused trouble on purpose. She was not afraid at all and took the initiative to call me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to turn around and look at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, are you coming here to eat alone tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia looked at me thoughtfully and proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite our secret alliance, she still enjoyed the superiority of having her arm around Elliott. She was competing with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's none of your business, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finished speaking expressionlessly, turned around, and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This store has just been reserved by Elliott. If you don't mind, you can stay and eat with us!" Sylvia said proudly.</span></p></div>
