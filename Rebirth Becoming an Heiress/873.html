        <h1>Chapter 873: Hurting Him Again</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Quinn didn't say a thing, just offered a helpless smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That smile hid an endless sorrow, a sight that twisted my heart like a knife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lost for words? Then do me a favor and vanish from my sight! If I ever catch you eyeing Madeline again, don't expect me to spare you out of friendship!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood before me, deliberately shielding my face with his body, as if every glance Quinn stole was a bargain he'd won.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quietly tucked away the diamond ring, once again leaving in solitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shoved Elliott aside, watching Quinn's retreating figure, but words failed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sorry, Quinn... I'm so sorry...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only apologize to him over and over again in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know I'm ruthless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all my years, I've met a man who's been so good to me, yet time and again, I've chosen to hurt him due to circumstances beyond my control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, could you keep your distance from Quinn in the future, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had no clue what was going on in my mind. The moment Quinn left, he immediately gripped my shoulders, looking at me with an urgency in his voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded slightly, murmuring a soft affirmation, my emotions a tangled mess within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Muller once mentioned that with my full cooperation and the aid of medication, there's a chance to gradually dissolve the blood clot causing Elliott's amnesia within three months.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next three months, to dodge another round of awkwardness, it's best I keep my encounters with Quinn to a minimum.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott recovers sooner, I can get back to a normal love life a bit earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I felt a bit better in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Waiter, check please!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my agreement, Elliott breathed a sigh of relief. He called out towards the direction of the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That gentleman just snagged it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter responded in a fluster.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, even in his fit of rage, Quinn still picked up the tab.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott led me out of the revolving restaurant's grand entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We rode the elevator in silence, descending to the grand lobby on the first floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a familiar figure flashed across the hall. Dressed in a bright red trench coat and strutting in white high heels, she was like a ball of fire floating not far from us. In no time, she disappeared behind a door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa Fox, there she is again!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does she always seem to pop up wherever I am? Can there really be that many coincidences?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I halted, swiveling to face Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Lisa Fox tip you off that I was dining here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott froze for a few seconds, somewhat surprised that I had guessed correctly. But he nodded anyway, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. She mentioned spotting you and Quinn here, so I made a beeline right over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's really her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mean, what are the odds of Elliott just happening to show up here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is Lisa Fox up to? Is she interested in Elliott, or is it me she's after?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you find this woman a bit odd? Can you sense her interest in you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to Elliott, curious about his real feelings towards Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, she's just a business partner. What she thinks, what she does, I couldn't care less."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott spoke with a detached tone. It seemed like he had no thoughts of Lisa beyond their professional dealings,"</span></p></div>
