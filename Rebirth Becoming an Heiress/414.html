        <h1>Chapter 414 Give It Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finished speaking and immediately hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood with crossed arms, quietly watching him, feeling calm inside as if I had no emotions at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I would have been moved to tears by his willingness to confront his own family for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his actions seemed to have no effect on my mood whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have sensed my emotional detachment because, for the first time, he showed a hint of panic in his eyes, when usually, he was firm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing at the clothes on the floor, he said to me, "These clothes have been tainted by someone else. If you don't like them, it's okay. I'll have Sean throw them all away. I'll buy you new ones, whatever you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I simply shook my head calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that. These are old clothes that I no longer care for. If she likes them so much, I can pack them all up and give them to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned and started to walk away. Sensing my indifference, Elliott grabbed my cold hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, whatever you want. You just threw up, so you must be feeling unwell. Let me take you to the hospital for a check-up and then we can go see how your dad is doing, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone remained gentle, with an unprecedented patience in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell he was genuinely trying to make me warm up and get closer to him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I pushed him away again. With a faint smile, I spoke with detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I've always had a weak stomach. Maybe I haven't been resting well lately and caught a cold. You go ahead with your plans, and I'll handle my dad's situation myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My indifferent response dimmed the light in his eyes once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, clearly displeased,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we have to have such cold conversations between us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sighed heavily after glancing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some facts couldn't be changed in the short term. Repeating them would only make our interactions more meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying anything more, I turned and quickly left the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, I instructed Sean to pack up all the clothes from upstairs right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean didn't understand why, but he quickly had the clothes packed and brought down from upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, are you taking these clothes back home?" Sean asked respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sean, I want you to have these clothes sent to Encounter Florist, which is not far from the Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean seemed puzzled. He looked at me with confusion and asked, "But isn't that...isn't that Ms. Cole's family's flower shop? Are you giving these clothes to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, since she's so eager to have my old clothes, I might as well give them all to her. It's better than giving them to beggars," I said coldly. In that moment, Sean understood my intention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded in understanding. Soon, he arranged for a car to load all the clothes and send them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I unlocked my phone, found Giselle's number, and dialed it directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, she had saved my number. As soon as the call connected, her sharp voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Madeline, why are you calling me today? Have you come to your senses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, unless she was in front of Elliott, she seemed too lazy to even put on her act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, not quite. I'm just calling to inform you something. Since you seem to like my old clothes so much, I've had them all packed and sent to your mom's flower shop. I'm sure with your sheltered upbringing, you'll cherish these clothes."</span></p></div>
