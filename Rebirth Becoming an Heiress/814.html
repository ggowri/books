        <h1>Chapter 814: Growing Apart</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he be here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was taken aback. He couldn't help but blurt out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected to find Elliott here, let alone arriving before him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like I should be the one asking you that, Quinn. Did you just brush off my warning like it was nothing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stepped forward. He looked at Quinn, a mix of irritation and amusement in his voice as he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's expression was a complex one at that moment. He glanced at me. In that split second, I noticed his fists were clenched tight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon seeing the look in my eyes, Quinn chose to hold back. He said in a nonchalant manner:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to take care of some business. Figured since Madeline is around, I'd swing by for a visit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was this detour of a visit really necessary? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stepped forward, asserting his dominance right in front of Quinn. He casually draped an arm around my shoulders, his dark, intense eyes locked on Quinn. The disdain in his voice seemed like a warning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm famished, Madeline. Got anything to eat?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn has always been understanding. He knew I was currently concerned about Elliott's health, so I had to accommodate Elliott. Therefore, he didn't make a fuss and smoothly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but the food's gone cold. I had Jane whip up some pasta for you, come on in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gently shrugged off Elliott's hand, signaling for Quinn to go ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Quinn didn't want to witness any intimacy between Elliott and me. So, he just nodded, said nothing, and walked in ahead of us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hollered into the room:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, could you whip up some spaghetti for Quinn? He's famished!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roger that, Mrs. Bryant&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Jane's response echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to step into the yard when, unexpectedly, Elliott grabbed my hand. His voice was somewhat cold:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, let's have a chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback, instinctively furrowing my brows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you... why are you so cold towards me now? You didn't seem happy at all when you saw me. But just now, when you saw Quinn, why were you so thrilled?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, one hand tucked in his pocket, met my gaze, his eyes brimming with skepticism.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Isn't it the same? Are you being overly sensitive now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I feigned ignorance, responding with a nonchalant counter-question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped my shoulder, his face etched with confusion and inquiry:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it just me being overly sensitive? Madeline, don't you think you've been acting a bit off with me lately? You weren't like this before&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I'm just worn out lately. Don't overthink it. Come on, let's go inside."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, deliberately dodging the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, right now, I can't explain much to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I turned and stepped back into the yard, Quinn was deep in animated conversation with them. The yard was filled with the sound of laughter and cheerful chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once seated, Quinn and Marcus started a debate over who could hold their liquor better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus has always had a penchant for strong liquor, considering himself unbeatable in the drinking game. However, Quinn's arrival and challenge to a drinking contest instantly amped up the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn challenged everyone present to place their bets on who could hold their liquor better between the two of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked in, taking in the heartwarming scene before me. In no time, I found myself bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately stepped forward:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, this isn't fair, you know. Marcus had quite a few drinks before you even showed up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn waved his hand dismissively:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much has he had before? I can catch up first, then compete with him. Marcus, you tell me, how much do I need to catch up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's down this full glass of liquor then. But I'm warning you, this stuff is pretty strong, Quinn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes crinkled into slits as he laughed. He might seem reserved on the surface, but beneath that, he was all fire and passion.</span></p></div>
