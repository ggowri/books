        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I interrupted him directly and shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, everyone has their own desired life. In the past, I was lost and only focused on dating. But now I have awakened, and I want a life that belongs to me. Do you know? When I first stood on the stage and calmly told my story of struggle, and at that moment, when so many people below were listening attentively, I suddenly realized that there are many things in life that are more meaningful and valuable than dating. I am a woman, but I don't want to be defined by my gender. I am not afraid of being tired either, a little tired is nothing. When I reach the peak of my life, all the hardships and fatigue will be worth it, right?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Marcus with a determined gaze, and when I questioned him like that, he was instantly rendered speechless. Several seconds passed before he finally couldn't help but raise a thumbs-up. "Madeline, for the first time, I realized that you have such foresight. I take back everything I just said, I underestimated you. You are much stronger than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had experienced what I had experienced, you would understand why I am strong," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and scenes from the previous life involuntarily flashed through my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betrayed by my family, my lineage destroyed, the man I loved ruthlessly trampled me underfoot, his dream lover arrogantly bullied me... All those experiences were enough to constantly remind me that fate had given me a chance to start over, but never again like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what have you been through? I feel like it's definitely more than just the breakdown of your marriage with Elliott," Marcus asked me eagerly, his eyes revealing a strong curiosity toward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pursed my lips and shook my head. "Never mind, Marcus. Let's not talk about that anymore. Let's discuss our collaboration going forward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly switched the topic to work and didn't want to delve further into this subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus saw me avoiding the topic, so he wisely stopped and didn't continue to ask further. Suddenly, he said, "Actually, this trip to Norch City to acquire medicinal herbs has sparked many ideas in my mind. The best quality herbs are actually found deep in the mountains and forests. However, due to the isolation of transportation and information in that area, it is extremely difficult to acquire these herbs. I actually want to invest and establish a factory in that mountainous region. On one hand, it can help solve the local residents' employment problems, and on the other hand, it will facilitate better collection of medicinal herbs. However, my available funds are limited, and this kind of investment is quite risky..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can analyze the feasibility, and if it is feasible, I can invest together," I said </span><span>immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you interested?" Marcus perked up, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "I actually have some preliminary ideas, but if you really want to invest, I suggest you not just listen to me. It would be better to visit Norch City in person for a thorough inspection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did you go to Norch City for an inspection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words suddenly gave me a slight urge to go out for a walk.</span></p></div>
