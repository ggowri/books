        <h1>Chapter 266 Final Notice</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a bit more time. Once the matters in Louis City are settled, I'll initiate the divorce with Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I knew what Laura meant. Now that this was the case, anything more I said would seem far-fetched and cheap on my part.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words into the phone, I feared I might emotionally unravel if the conversation persisted, so I promptly ended the call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drove straight to the entrance of the highway to Louis City, looking inside the car at the pendant I'd purchased halfway up the mountain that day while hiking with Elliott, and the sweet scenes of those few days echoed in my mind once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for this sudden checkup, Elliott and I might have continued on our path and could have been as happy as all normal couples, envisioning our future and imagining the joy of becoming a family of three once we had a baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, fate was mysterious. After Elliott and I had repaired our relationship, my body uncovered a hidden illness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on last night's passionate sex, coupled with our marriage, which had shown some promise but seemed to come to a screeching halt suddenly, I found myself increasingly bewildered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;I sped furiously down the highway. Laura, perhaps thinking I was deliberately delaying my divorce from Elliott, actually sent me another text shortly after I hung up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, I still wish it would be over between you and Elliott as soon as possible. It's not that our family is unkind. Due to illness, Cormac doesn't have much time to wait. I'm sorry.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gave me the final notice via text message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her text message caused me to break down. I veered off the road and hurried into the expressway service area. Collapsing over the steering wheel, I wept uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on Elliott's behavior last night, I was sure enough that he was not entirely without a shred of affection for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that we were getting closer and that soon I was going to capture Elliott's heart, but I couldn't have imagined that my health would play such a big joke on me at this point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of Giselle's complacency that day and all the stories she had brought up, including her past with Elliott, whether her words were true or watered down, I was unwilling to let her take my place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened WhatsApp and fixed my eyes on Elliott's profile picture among the contacts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any chat history, I stared at his profile picture for a long, long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't anticipate that he, who seldom messaged me, would suddenly reach out as if we shared a telepathic connection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Where have you gone?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had clearly just awakened, unaware of what had happened, pondering my sudden disappearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I read this sentence, tears fell down again unconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily typed on the keyboard, continuously revising the text, deleting and rewriting it over and over again... Yet, in the end, I remained at a loss for what to reply to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably noticing my prolonged silence, he called me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still unsure of what to say if I were to answer his call, I repeatedly ignored it. Eventually, he abandoned his persistence and refrained from calling again.</span></p></div>
