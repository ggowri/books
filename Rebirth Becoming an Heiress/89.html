        <h1>Chapter 89 Go to His Office</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A more suitable supplier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this matter related to Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became alert and calmly asked, "When did they tell you they had found other suppliers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They contacted me in the past few days. I had prepared the flowers for them, thinking of delivering them after signing the contract. I don't know what happened, but they suddenly informed me that they won't be cooperating with me," Paige said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, she couldn't help but blame Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona have always belittled Elliott in front of me due to his indifferent attitude towards me over the years. I have become accustomed to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After we finished eating, I went to ask Elliott. Don't worry," I said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recommended Paige because I didn't want Giselle to have the opportunity to meet Elliott every day by sending flowers. So, I had to prevent this from happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having dinner with Paige and Fiona, I packed a portion of foie gras and went to the office building of the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Elliott's preferences. The foie gras at this restaurant was one of his favorite foods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he was also a regular here. That's why I used to come here often with my friends before. I hope to have the chance to meet him more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I arrived at the Bryant Group around 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was riding the elevator to the floor where Elliott's office was located, Barry, his assistant, happened to be standing at the elevator door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry saw me and was still trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant was in a meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because I used to cry and make a fuss, I left a bad impression on Barry. Every time he saw me, he would habitually say, "Elliott is not here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed and handed the coffee I packed to Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, I remember you loved drinking coffee, so I specially packed a cup for you from Listen to the Wind. Is Mr. Bryant in the office? Don't worry. I'm here to deliver food to him, not to cause trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry took the coffee with surprise. Before he could react, I walked towards Elliott's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, wait..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry hurriedly caught up with me, but he couldn't stop me. I pushed open the door to Elliott's office, and as soon as I entered, I immediately revealed a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, were you busy? I didn't disturb you, did I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rarely spoke to him so gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat behind a large desk. Upon hearing my voice, he instinctively looked up. When he saw me, a hint of confusion flickered in his deep eyes. He forced a smile and waved his hand, gesturing for Barry to leave. Then, he asked, "What are you doing here?"</span></p></div>
