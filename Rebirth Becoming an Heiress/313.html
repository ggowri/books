        <h1>Chapter 313 New Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed overly excited, so he rushed in without paying attention to what was happening in the hospital room and immediately exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved a stack of documents, his expression unusually cheerful. It was evident that there had been a breakthrough in my father's accident case.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, he noticed Elliott standing tall like a mountain in the hospital room, and his smile froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Elliott, you're here," Quinn greeted immediately. However, perhaps sensing the heavy atmosphere in the room, his expression sobered, and he subconsciously shifted his gaze towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? What happened?" Elliott slowly turned around, his face filled with anger as he looked at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you'd rather seek Quinn's help for everything than come to me, right?" Clearly, Quinn's earlier words had plunged Elliott into a more profound misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment, unsure of what to say. I could only explain, "Well, mainly because you're busier, and he's less occupied."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed visibly awkward. I knew he wasn't idle, but he had always treated my affairs as his own. "Yeah, I guess I'm less busy. You're busy with company matters every day and don't have time for these trivial things."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn realized the discord between Elliott and me and quickly tried to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott gave Quinn a cold look. With his hands in his pockets, he seemed shrouded in a thick fog of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In her eyes, anyone is more important than me, including you," Elliott spat out coldly before pushing Quinn aside abruptly. Then, he left the hospital room in giant strides without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was caught off guard by Elliott's forceful push and stumbled for a moment. He instinctively grabbed the door frame to steady himself, looking at me with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. "Did I just walk into a minefield again? It's really unfair. I didn't do anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott always seems to be in such a bad mood nowadays," I shook my head, unable to help but comment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as I remembered Quinn's mention of new developments in the case, I couldn't afford to dwell on what Elliott might be thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly asked Quinn, "You mentioned there's been new progress in the case. What is it? Tell me now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you should go after Elliott first and explain things to him properly. It's not good for you two to be at odds like this." My mom, seeing that I wasn't concerned about Elliott, became so anxious that she even stamped her foot, urging me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's okay. I know where to draw the line between us." I shook my head and reassured her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for my mom to say anything more, I dragged Quinn out of the hospital room. We hurried to a corner of the corridor, and I immediately asked, "Is there any new lead regarding the driver?"</span></p></div>
