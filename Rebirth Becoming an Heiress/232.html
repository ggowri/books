        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it this way, I felt relieved. At this moment, I received a message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up my phone and found the message was from Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Giselle to be still awake this late, nor did I expect Elliott to see her again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the two were eating together late at night, and Giselle even took a photo of Elliott drinking wine and sent it to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, Elliott has been drinking. I'm afraid he will get drunk. Can you come and pick him up?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humph. She was very kind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She obviously wanted to show off to me that Elliott went to look for her so late, yet she pretended to be kind and asked me if I wanted to pick him up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the decadent Elliott in the photos, feeling even more disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guessed he went to find Giselle immediately after we separated. She was really irreplaceable to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't reply to Giselle's message because I was afraid I couldn't sleep if I kept talking to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott was willing to be with her, then I wished they could get together as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became irritable for no reason, so I put my phone aside to charge, then took a shower, lay on the bed, and fell asleep quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, I was woken up by Lily's knock on the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's wrong? I need more sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Madeline. Get up and have breakfast. I heard Elliott's grandpa fell. We will go to the hospital and visit him after breakfast," Lily shouted outside the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Lily to know about Cormac's falling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my eyes, got up, picked up my phone, and looked at the time. It was almost nine o'clock in the morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mom," I responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I got up, washed up, opened the door, and walked downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had gone to work. A well-prepared breakfast cooked by Lily on the table. Lily wore a silver exquisite suit, a jeweled necklace, and a jeweled bracelet. She put her hair up. She sat at the table elegantly and waited for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lily wearing jewelry she didn't wear often, I asked with a smile, "Mom, why are you dressed up so delicately?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled, "It's rare for me to see Mr. Bryant. Naturally, I should dress up perfectly, lest you be looked down upon by his family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly remembered that Lily and Austin did the same in my last life. They always put me first. Although they only met the Bryant family several times, they got upset every time because of the conflict between Elliott and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my last life, Lily and Austin were often badly treated because of the matter between Elliott and me. Even though our family was equal in strength to theirs, Lily and Austin were always humble as if they were inferior to them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of what they had done for me, I couldn't help but tell myself inwardly, "In this life, if there is another occasion like this, I will never let my parents be bullied again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. You are so beautiful and elegant. No one dares to look down on us. What's so great about the Bryant family? We don't have to be afraid of them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cheered Lily up, and my words amused her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's so sweet, but we just need to be ourselves and don't have to compare with others. I just hope that you can be respected by them. As your mom, of course, I will support you."</span></p></div>
