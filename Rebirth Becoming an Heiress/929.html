        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a whole day of playing like this, we were all tired, and it wasn't until about nine o'clock in the evening that we finally returned to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It's really too tiring! I'm going to take a comfortable bath, then we'll open a bottle of red wine and have some, what do you say?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't help but exclaim as soon as we got back to the suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Okay, then let's soak in the bath first, and in a while, we'll directly ask the butler to fetch a bottle of the most expensive red wine, someone else will pay for it anyway!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona, this guy, this is the rhythm of ruthlessly trying to rip off Elliott, hearing me helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The most expensive red wine here, that needs millions of dollars, you don't be so ruthless, just the general ones.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I meant not to be too wasteful, however, as soon as I said that, they both slanted me a look and Paige hammered at me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>L</span><span>ook at you, you're so out of it, now you're starting to feel sorry for his money?Madeline, the two of us are laying down our lives to test the gold for you, who let him be such an asshole in the past, letting you suffer so much, what's wrong with letting him spend a little more money?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No, I'm not heartbroken about his money, I just don't think we need to waste it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed and subconsciously defended myself sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Okay, I could tell a long time ago that you never actually let go of him. But, to be honest, he does seem smoother now than when I saw him before.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona patted me on the shoulder, she frowned, but I could hear a hint of recognition for Elliott in her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He does have a much better attitude than he used to, where he used to look at us properly. when Madeline married him, he found it repulsive to even have Madeline party with us, let alone have dinner with us. Do you remember one time the three of us ran into each other at a cocktail party, and we went up to him and told him we were Madeline's girlfriends, and he just gave us a little nod and turned away. Damn, I can't help but get angry when I think about how lowly Madeline was in front of him at that time </span><span>......</span><span> No, Madeline, you mustn't go soft, we must order the most expensive red wine at night!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said as she couldn't help but reminisce about the old days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she said that, both Fiona and I's memories instantly opened up, and what she was talking about was just a small detail from those humble days of yore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in fact, such a detail was once too much in my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life I have suffered less, and in the last life, even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time in my last life, he had been with Giselle all day long, and was very pampering to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember that time there is a reporter specially tracked Giselle a day of life, Elliott not only for her in the mansion specifically to create a luxury checkroom, but also specially for her to do a whole wall of shoe cabinets, shoe cabinets of various styles of brand</span><span>-</span><span>name shoes arranged a whole wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, she also has a whole cabinet of Hermes bags, a whole wall of limited edition clothing, a whole drawer of jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything she loved, Elliott purchased for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his last life, he gave Giselle a constant stream of luxury and pampering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember being broke and living in a shabby rented room, and watching everything Giselle owned on TV, and being so stimulated that I burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, why should I feel wasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was all this now compared to what Giselle had wasted in her last life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, I straightened my heart out and took it upon myself to call the personal butler and ask him to fetch us the most expensive red wine and to prepare us an order of the freshest sashimi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona saw that I had figured it out, and she instantly gave a thumbs up as she smiled and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That's right, a woman should never think of saving money for her man. If you don't spend money, there are other women who will want to spend money. If he really cares about you, he will do whatever it takes, why would he put this money in his eyes. Besides, a woman is meant to be able to spend a man's money, and the more you spend, the more valuable he'll think you are and the less he'll be able to leave you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona also didn't know where she learned it from, and directly preached to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I understand. Don't worry, I'm definitely not going soft next!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We each went back to the bathroom and took a comfortable soak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time we emerged from the bathroom after soaking and wearing our bathrobes, the personal butler had already opened the red wine and placed it on the dining room table, and, as I had instructed, prepared a beautifully plated sashimi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us sat down around the table and Fiona poured wine into each of the three goblets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We raised our glasses and clinked them, then we all tilted our heads back and drank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bottle of red wine must have a very long vintage, and when we drank it in our mouths, it had an extremely rich aroma and an extraordinary taste, which gave me, who hadn't had a drink for a long time, a feeling of floating in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us drank freely while chatting, as we chatted, suddenly, Fiona put down her wine glass, and with the calmest of tones, suddenly burst out with news that shocked us extremely:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>By the way, to tell you guys something, I </span><span>......</span><span> am ready to get married next month.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ah? With who?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and I both asked as our jaws instantly dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>With my first love, he went back home, he broke up with his girlfriend.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally thought that Fiona was with Alexis, however, to my surprise, she was getting married, not to Alexis, but to that first love who fell in love with someone else as soon as she went abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, are you okay? He treated you so badly in the first place and you still want to marry him? He's treating you like an alternative! How come you're so clear</span><span>-</span><span>headed when it comes to other people's affairs, but when it's your turn, you're so confused?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige instantly exploded when she heard that, and she immediately growled at Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yeah, Fiona, you need to think this through. Your first love has been dragging you down for so many years, and now he's coming back to marry you, does he have pure intentions? Is he in love with you, are you clear or not?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that women ah, really easy to fall into passivity in the relationship, even like Fiona such a sensible and sober girl, surprisingly, will also be in the relationship to eat boring losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>He said that he has always had me in his heart for so many years, and, after he broke up with that girlfriend of his, he realized that I am the most suitable for him. He and I are both in the medical field after all, we have a lot in common, and I've always aspired to faithful love, I like the ultimate romance of only liking one person for the rest of my life. I gave him my first time, and now that he's willing to turn back, I think I'll stay with him, I've decided!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona is a lot like me in some ways; we're both the kind of people who turn stubborn once we get an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, we both even agree on our outlook on relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason I was obsessed with Elliott in the first place, and I've had nothing but him in my heart for so many years, is because I've always wished that I could be unwavering with him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, when you say Madeline is relationship</span><span>-</span><span>brained, aren't you? You're thirty years old now, have you thought about the fact that there's no turning back in case he still hurts you in the end? No man is going to stay put, Alexis has been so good to you, what do you </span><span>......</span><span> you think!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shouted angrily, she got anxious all of a sudden and couldn't help but roll her eyes widely at Fiona.</span></p></div>
