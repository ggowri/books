        <h1>Chapter 30 Capricious</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only care about the reputation of the Bryant family. It's fine. I can be the one to initiate the divorce, as long as you convert those two billion dollars into shares for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin had mentioned this idea when Elliott and I got married two years ago. He wanted me to get some shares at the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, I naively believed that once we got married, our possessions would be shared and there would be no need to fight over fame and fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back now, I realize that my past self was really naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was twenty billion dollars. This love was too expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is even more tragic is that I devoted so much money and the best years of my youth, but in Elliott's eyes, I was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's response was very straightforward, and I wasn't surprised at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You care so much about Sylvia, why don't you just divorce me and be with her? Perhaps, in the future, you will meet your true love. Why should I hinder your path to love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Giselle, who would appear soon, I couldn't help but kindly remind Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lowered his head, his gaze deep and still elusive, as he said in a faint voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about this. I am accompanying you to your parents' house now. Tonight, you had to move back to Serenity Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to sleep with me again, and I didn't know why he insisted on having me move back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless. The more he acted like this, the less I wanted to listen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't move back, don't force me, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll say it one last time. You moved back to Serenity Villa. Madeline, you better not challenge my bottom line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, clearly he had already reached the edge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, Toby, had already started driving. The vehicle was speeding along the winding mountain road, and the eerie atmosphere inside the car made me angry as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I had already sworn that I would never let Elliott manipulate me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything I did had to be based on my willingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would no longer fear his tyranny, and I would no longer care about his thoughts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't go back, even if you tied me up and forced me to go back, I would still go to my parents' house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also reiterated my bottom line and my tone was even more resolute than his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gave me a cold glance. I couldn't describe his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, his gaze was terrifying and icy, as if all patience had been completely worn away, sending chills down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly yelled at Toby, "Toby, stop the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby was startled, and the entire body of the car shook for a moment. However, he immediately reacted and applied the brakes, bringing the car to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thing I hated the most in my life was a woman who acted willfully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott coldly dropped a sentence and, without waiting for me to say anything else, directly grabbed my collar and threw me out of the carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell to the ground in a sorry state. The stone by the roadside hurt me terribly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biting cold wind echoed mournfully in the valley. Despite it being midsummer, the nighttime temperature in the mountains remained cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but shiver as I sat up from the ground, and Elliott's car had already driven away.</span></p></div>
