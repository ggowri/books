        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Alexis </span><span>......</span><span> He's really nice, but there's no way I can follow my heart to him. That's a feeling Madeline should know very well.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said as she turned her gaze to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously nodded, and in that moment, Quinn came to mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I be any different with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew better than anyone that Quinn was extraordinarily sincere with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I have never been able to truly feel anything for him, and even I don't know why that is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emotional matters are really hard to express clearly in just a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You guys ah, really </span><span>......</span><span> I don't care how you decide, anyway, I can't tolerate sand in my eyes. If a scumbag dares to treat me like this once, I'll have to break up with him!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige looked at us with a disgusted tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So there's no way you're getting back together with Philip, no matter how much he tries to keep you?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked Paige rhetorically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all know clearly that since Paige and Philip broke up, Paige's life is even more dashing and happy than before, but Philip, however, seems to have changed like a different person that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the departure of his child was a big blow to him, so he has completely tightened up, and now not only is he back to working properly in their family business, but he has been trying to find a way to get Paige back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No way, I'm not like you guys who keep getting stuck in past relationships. Isn't it nice to have a new life? Isn't a new man good? There are men all over the place out there, why keep hanging on to one tree?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige spread her hands as she raised an eyebrow at us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I thought like you before, but since I've entered my thirties, I've changed my mind. It's true that the world is changing fast, and it's true that it's easy to start a new relationship and a new life whenever you want, but it's hard to hold on to a long</span><span>-</span><span>lasting relationship. Nowadays, the concept of everyone has changed, more and more people are divorced, a relationship is also more and more trials, many relationships can not have a good ending in the end, the original two people who love each other can easily because of a little bit of small things to become strangers. However, if a relationship goes wrong, shouldn't it be the responsibility of both parties? Is giving up really the only reasonable solution? Giving up is really one of the easiest ways to go, it's harder to hold on than to give up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona rested her cheeks as she made a show of thinking seriously about life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this relationship between her and her first love, she was thinking about her choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're thinking like the previous generation, okay? Being faithful for a man who has cheated on you multiple times and is addicted to gambling?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige rolled her eyes in an attitude of complete disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That's the crux of the matter, ah, if a man is really bad and has made a principled mistake, then of course leaving is a better choice, but if the other person has corrected his mistakes and deeply reflected on his past mistakes, and he still has feelings for the other person, can't he give the other person a chance to start over?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona debated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were drinking expensive red wine while arguing, however, I just listened quietly and didn't speak the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because I was so quiet that they both turned to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, so what do you think?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly stunned for a moment, then blandly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I don't think anything because sometimes it's useless to think. People have two modes of thinking, one relies on the brain and one relies on the heart. However, no matter how rational the brain is, it is ultimately no match for the heart. I can only follow my heart, and I think most people, in the end, follow their hearts. In fact, there is no point in arguing about this, because very often, how people's hearts think, only they know. Getting back together is fine, starting over is fine, everything follows the heart. When the time comes, there will naturally be an answer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I said that, both of them were instantly surprised, and the atmosphere, which was still high just now, instantly cooled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hate to admit it, but you're pretty right.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige chimed in instead of choosing to continue the war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Follow your heart and Follow your mind, you chose the former and so did I.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona reached over and clinked her glass with mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Well, instead of struggling, follow your heart.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, and at that moment, the heavy burden of thoughts in my head was instantly put aside as I tilted my head back and drank the red wine in my glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the bottle of red wine was finished by us, and then, we each went back to our rooms and fell into a deep sleep under the hypnosis of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Elliott not only managed to stay with us throughout the entire trip, but he also planned each day thoroughly and took us to many of Korea's famous online attractions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is said that the best way to observe a man's character is to travel with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the trip, his strengths and weaknesses will be exposed in front of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trip, which was supposed to be just a girlfriends' trip, turned out to be a test for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though it was something he didn't expect, Elliott steadily caught on, and not only did he catch on, but he also showed a lot of sides of himself throughout the trip that I hadn't seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that he spoke Korean so well, and even multiple languages such as French and Japanese, all at the drop of a hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not only a good golfer, but also a good horseman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he is not only an outstanding entrepreneur, but he is also quite knowledgeable about astronomy, geography, history and culture, and he knew the sights and customs of any place during the whole trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole experience was superb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed an excellent guide and throughout the trip, he steadily picked up on Fiona and Paige's questions and was completely unfazed by the fact that even though we spent countless amounts of his money, he spent it as we pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could already see the change in Fiona and Paige's attitude towards him in the way they were softening up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, we planned to fly back home after our last stop at Jeju Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I never expected that on the morning of our return trip, when I got up from the bed, my brain was dizzy and my body was cold. </span><span>......</span></p></div>
