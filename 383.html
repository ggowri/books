  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said, "It's impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The intelligence is wrong. Osborne actually has the lightning power. Lauren said that he is a mind control metahuman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just been so smug. At this moment, seeing that Osborne didn't get injured from the terrifying lightning but even looked happy, Wade couldn't hold back his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was in the same situation as Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately tried to control the Blessing of Thunder and take it back, but he couldn't do it at all. Instead, because of his anxiety, tiny streaks of lightning appeared on his body again and moved madly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sign that his power was about to lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Wade saw this situation, his expression changed. He no longer cared about Osborne, quickly rushed to Alexander, and held his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yelled, "Alexander, calm down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things can't be changed. This is a mistake in our intelligence. Consolidate your power immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Alexander didn't seem to hear what Wade said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power around him was fluctuating wildly, but he was still trying desperately to take back the Blessing of Thunder with an angry face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's expression changed drastically. He activated his mighty thunder power to suppress Alexander's violent power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Alexander vomited blood, and his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's thunder power collided with his violent power, causing injuries to Alexander. Fortunately, it made him sober up. Feeling the unstable and surging power, Alexander frowned and quickly suppressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade also vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a Class A Power Master, he was injured after his power collided with Alexander's. When he saw Alexander regain his composure, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his arms as if embracing the huge lightning. The lightning passed through his body without causing any damage to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, it was improving his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elemental essence of lightning in Osborne's body was absorbing the power of the Blessing of Thunder. As more and more power was absorbed, the elemental essence was becoming stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his body became stronger and stronger under the hit of the Blessing of Thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had an unprecedented feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even felt that his body had reached its limit. If he tried to break through Class A immediately, he would have a great chance of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling made him intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Alexander's move is actually the Blessing of Thunder. He didn't kill me but helped me improve my lightning elemental essence and even strengthen my body, allowing me to reach my limit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder was indeed a powerful and terrifying attack. Eve Isaac would most likely be killed by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought Osborne would not be able to bear his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he had the confidence to make a bet with Osborne and put a level three ancient magic weapon as the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Alexander was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Osborne to be a lightning-controlling metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder was a terrifying attack for anyone, but for lightning-controlling metahuman, it was an opportunity to improve their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder could not hurt someone who had the lightning elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne did not get injured. He absorbed a large amount of the Blessing of Thunder's power to improve his lightning elemental essence and enhance his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gained great benefit from Alexander's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder was a windfall for Alexander. After he stabilized his power, he could absorb the power of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, his strength would be even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he actually used the Blessing of Thunder to attack Osborne, which ended up benefiting Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Alexander's power was unstable, and he couldn't take back the Blessing of Thunder in time. By the time he controlled it, Osborne had already absorbed most of the power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recovered and waved his hand. The lightning immediately shrank and appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed it on his forehead, and suddenly, the lightning pattern appeared again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, everyone could see that the lightning pattern was much dimmer than before, and it seemed to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Alexander angry. He trembled violently and seemed to be out of control again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade hurriedly held his shoulders and shook his head at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Alexander, don't be angry. Your power is not stable yet. Don't be angry, or you will be the only one who suffers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've lost the Blessing of Thunder. No matter how angry you are, you can't change the situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said this with a grim face. Alexander clenched his fists but finally held back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blessing of Thunder was the reward from the God of Thunder when he made a breakthrough. However, before he could absorb it, Osborne absorbed most of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Alexander was in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was flashing with lightning, and his condition seemed to have reached its peak. Obviously, his strength had significantly increased. Looking at him, Alexander almost vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a big loss!</span></p><div class="pagination">
