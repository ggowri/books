  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung the Death Sickle, unleashing a bizarre energy that radiated outwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Emma had a strategy for Melanie, so did Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transformed into pure light, Melanie had shed her physical limitations, making her speed, strength, and defense horrifyingly formidable, seemingly without weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she couldn't be invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must have a weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if her weaknesses are not so obvious, she must have weaknesses. Otherwise, it would be too outrageous. Her ranking among the Godsons of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> wouldn't just be fifteen. It should be first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne quickly deduced that a spiritual attack could exploit her vulnerabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her lack of a physical body, her soul remained intact, making her susceptible to spiritual attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne took out the Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Melanie's incredible speed made it impossible to pinpoint her location. Instead, he directed the Death Sickle's unique powers to surge in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie stifled a grunt, retreating quickly and regarding Osborne with a grave expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne's Death Sickle and murmured, "That's the Death Sickle of Chris </span><span>Wood, the disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Why do you have it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and replied casually, "Someone gave it to me. Why? You seem to be very afraid of the Death Sickle? That's right, the Death Sickle seems to be able to restrain you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Melanie's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you have the Death Sickle, so what? Chris himself couldn't defeat me in my light form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My soul is my only weakness, but not just any spiritual attack can hurt me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, I don't believe you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she charged again, moving too quickly for Osborne to track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't need to see her clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already knew that her soul was her only vulnerability and that his spiritual attack could harm her. He didn't need to hold back his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chris can't do anything to you. That doesn't mean I can't!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take another slash!" he shouted, raising the Death Sickle high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spiritual power surged wildly, and terrifying ripples burst out from the Death Sickle, shooting in all directions like a tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behead your soul."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Death Sickle swung down heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Melanie's shrill scream suddenly rang out, and her body made of light was hit by the attack wave of the Death Sickle and began to twist and fluctuate in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she could no longer maintain her light form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne would not hold back and raised the Death Sickle high again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behead again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Osborne's wide-ranging mental attack, even as she flickered with light, Melanie couldn't escape his attack unless she left the range of Arena Number One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she retreated, she'd lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only forcibly withstand Osborne's spiritual attack. The violent fluctuations erupted around her, and blood spilled from her luminous form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, her light collapsed back into flesh and blood, and she knelt, gasping and bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne, pale after two successive uses of the Death Sickle, filled with resentment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Death Sickle twice in a row had obviously exhausted Osborne's spiritual strength. If she had endured and maintained her Light Transformation, she would have won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she couldn't bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soul was severely injured, and though she could still fight, Osborne was her superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Predictably, Osborne did not let her recover. As her light form faded back to flesh, he charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he sent Melanie crashing to the ground, unable to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are defeated!" Osborne smiled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You called me lowly while claiming nobility as a Divine Descent? It's ridiculous. You lost to me like a dog."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Melanie coughed up more blood and glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said with difficulty, "Asshole, don't be smug. All the Divine Descents worldwide will come for you. You'll kneel and confess your sins to the gods. Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened. "I'll wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her, he turned to the anxious Rosenthal family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Who else is left? Come up. Let's finish this quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family's expressions darkened as they clenched their fists, anger brimming in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Melanie, who transformed into light, was defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked to the last fighter, a man in his late twenties, the youngest and least remarkable among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he stood, Osborne's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he sensed an immense threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This man is not simple. He must be the Rosenthal family's true ace!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
