  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Overestimating himself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's bragging!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Various sarcastic remarks arose, but this time Osborne didn't respond to them, completely ignoring them. However, Clara and Leroy couldn't stand others commenting on Osborne like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were very grateful for Osborne's care for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is very strong. They knew clearly that he wasn't bragging or arrogant, just stating facts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, hearing the ridicule and laughter from everyone, especially the words of Mason and Brenda, Clara and Leroy finally couldn't help but respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy stared at Mason and Brenda coldly and said, "Shut up! You're not worthy of Osborne personally dealing with you! If we meet at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I'll defeat you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "None of you are worthy of Osborne taking action! You have no right to mock the truth Osborne spoke. If I meet you in the ring, I will definitely teach you a lesson for Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Clara and Leroy finished speaking, even more hysterical laughter erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara and Leroy are the joint runners-up of Eastern Zone 3. So impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They just got lucky. They only stood out in the zone duel because Osborne entered the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're tied for last place on the rankings!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't even qualify to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can beat us in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel? Nonsense! Any one of us can defeat you in three moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, maybe just one move is enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Losers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's insults made Clara and Leroy clench their fists, itching to teach them a lesson right away, but in the end, they held back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because fighting at this time would break the rules! Today is the day of the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, and private fights are strictly forbidden within the Inner City of Nebula City. Otherwise, they would be immediately arrested and thrown into jail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fighting privately on the day of the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony is a serious crime!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Glorious Divine Emperor wouldn&rsquo;t easily fight anyone today; even if there&rsquo;s a grudge, it would be resolved after the day ends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we'll meet in the arena!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy said, "So what if we're last on the rankings? You'll see our strength then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope you won't end up crying then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope I run into them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, Clara, and Leroy stop responding, the crowd finally quieted down after mocking them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a powerful aura emerged within everyone's perception.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An elderly woman with white hair walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She swept her sharp gaze over everyone and said calmly, "It seems everyone is here! That's good, saves us from wasting time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me introduce myself. My name is Justina Porter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, all contestants, follow me! The Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony will begin soon. You need to first enter the Royal Sepulcher to await the Glorious Divine Emperor and the esteemed lords!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked solemn, bowed to Justina, and said, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also opened his eyes at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at the white-haired old woman, clenched his fists tightly, and his eyes revealed a murderous intent. "It's actually her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina is Callista's maid and has always been her trusted confidant. Even Weston grew up under Justina's care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's son, Lorenzo, and daughter, Lilith, are the people Osborne hates the most. They also grew up under Justina's care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason Osborne hates Justina is that she once hit Michelle. Although it was Callista's order, it was Justina who carried it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is yet another enemy of mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina's strength isn't great, only advanced Empyrean Sacredness, but she's Callista's trusted confidant and the one who raised the prince and princess. So, in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, her status is very high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even many princes and princesses greet Justina first when they see her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is truly shameless!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected it was Justina who brought them into the Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her strength is weak, that's a good thing! This way, it'll be easier for me to leave the group quietly and pay tribute to my mother without being noticed!" Thinking this, Osborne calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now is not the time for revenge; he still needs to keep hiding, or it will ruin his plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, he must first pay respects to Michelle, then enter Necropolis City and break through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne lowered his head, avoiding eye contact with Justina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't afraid of being recognized by Justina, as he was completely different in this life compared to the last, whether in appearance, demeanor, or aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his name was the same, there were too many people with the same name, so no one would think much of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was only afraid that Justina might sense his killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" Justina said, then prepared to lead everyone to the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, someone spoke, "Please wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Mason who spoke. "Justina, shouldn't you first verify our identities and qualifications to participate? It would be terrible if spies from enemy nations were among us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Mason cast a malicious glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As far as I know, one of us doesn't have a Kingdom Duel Badge! Since he doesn't have the Kingdom Duel Badge, he's not qualified to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina asked, "Who are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason smiled and pointed at Osborne, saying, "It's him! He doesn't have a Kingdom Duel Badge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others also looked at Osborne with mocking and sarcastic expressions. They had all heard that Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge and Kingdom Duel Scorepoints had been taken by Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne might have entered here by borrowing someone else's Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But using someone else's Kingdom Duel Badge can't prove Osborne's identity as a participant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His identity cannot be confirmed, so he naturally cannot participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And verifying identity is a troublesome matter. By the time Osborne finds a way to prove his identity, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel would probably already be over!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason was mockingly looking at Osborne at this moment, just like a cat playing with a mouse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't have a Kingdom Duel Badge?" Justina coldly stared at Osborne and said, "Prove your identity, or you cannot participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! The Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony is extremely important, and absolutely no unidentified person is allowed to enter the Royal Sepulcher!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone wanted to see Osborne's panicked expression, but unfortunately, they were disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, took out a Kingdom Duel Badge, and hung it on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Of course, I have a Kingdom Duel Badge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mason slandered me! I suspect he's actually toying with you. He's deliberately wasting your time, possibly hoping you'll make a mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, he has already sided with Prince Quinn..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Justina's expression changed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
