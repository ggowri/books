  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph fell into a deep silence, the weight of the situation pressing heavily on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke. "Whether we've been played or not, we've forged a deadly enmity with the Pantheon League. There's no turning back now; they won't let us off the hook, and we won't let them off theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the time being, we need to hold back on any major moves. The Pantheon League's strength has exceeded our expectations. Whatever methods they've employed, they've managed to keep a number of warriors from the Age of Gods alive and kicking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our best course of action is to wait&mdash;wait for our warriors in the Deschanel Clan to regain their strength and awaken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, we have the Sanctuary Casket on our side, which means our recovery will outpace theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The twenty or so warriors that Pantheon League has just awakened are barely back to Intermediate Deity level. They're at a disadvantage; it'll be tough for them to regain their former glory. Meanwhile, many of our warriors are already on their way back to the Superior Deity realm, and soon, even more will awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, we'll have Transcendent Deities, perhaps even Celestial Deities at our disposal! And by then, the Pantheon League will still be stuck at the Superior Deity level. Taking them down will be a walk in the park."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence shone in Joseph's eyes as he surveyed his comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they nodded in agreement. "It seems we don't have much choice! We thought we could dodge the calamities of the gods with the Sanctuary Casket and easily rule the new world once we awoke. Who would've thought the Pantheon League would be such a formidable opponent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them linger for a while longer. We'll wait until more of our elder warriors have regained their strength before we strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget about the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization; they need to be dealt with too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right! We need to wipe out the Prophet Alliance and the Court of the Sun as well! They all need to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, let's focus on building our strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, the Deschanel Clan soared back into the skies above Hearin City, eventually returning to the sanctuary of their family stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne chose not to follow them any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "So, they're gearing up to build their strength? Good, at least I've achieved my goal! The clash between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League has left both sides battered and furious; they're now sworn enemies! Until they settle their score, they're unlikely to make a move against the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This gives us precious time to ramp up our own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These dominant factions all have visions of world domination, and the Augustine family won't have the luxury of time to grow complacent. We need to get stronger if we want to survive and thrive in this chaotic world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmuring to himself, Osborne made his way back to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Sebastian, Anastasia, Bryce, and others were hard at work refining their Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, preparing for their ascension to godhood. Beyond them, the Augustine family was beginning to see a rise in other top-tier S-class warriors, all capable of refining their own Divine Bone and Divine Flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all went as planned, the Augustine family's divine warriors would soon emerge like mushrooms after a rainstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, should I share the Phoenix Ascension with them?" Osborne pondered, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mastering the Phoenix Ascension would allow one to elevate their Divine Body by two whole levels during the forging process&mdash;a truly game-changing effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the Age of Gods, Phoenix Ascension was considered one of the most elite secret arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain had stumbled upon it by chance, discovering both Phoenix Ascension and the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in the same location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had never revealed the existence of Phoenix Ascension to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Cain was a Deity Overlord, his many misdeeds had made him a target, preventing him from building his own faction or passing on the Phoenix Ascension to anyone outside of the Blood Clan descendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the Phoenix Ascension remained a closely guarded secret, its power so immense that even a Deity King would go to great lengths to steal it if they ever learned of its existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, should I pass Phoenix Ascension on to the rest of the Augustine family?" Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of Phoenix Ascension made him hesitant to spread it around&mdash;a leak could spell catastrophe for him and the Augustine family. The risk was too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have blind faith in every member of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, not sharing felt like squandering a golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, each Divine Body could leap two tiers in strength, a massive edge in power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind whirred, and a solution suddenly crystallized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I utilize Memory Control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye breaking through to Level Five, Osborne unlocked a new power&mdash;the ability to manipulate memories. Using this, Osborne could teach Phoenix Ascension to anyone, embedding a mental command ensuring it remained a tightly guarded secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking Osborne's command wouldn't be a cakewalk. It would require someone with higher realms than him and a Satan's Eye of even greater capability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne deemed that was practically impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's worth a shot. This way, the gods of my Augustine family will be born stronger than the rest at the very beginning!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
