  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darkness enveloped the battlefield once more, plunging everyone into an oppressive void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged among the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, all present were Supernal Deity Kings, and even in the Eclipse Realm, they could still regain some semblance of their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, what truly terrified them was the suffocating pressure of the absolute forbidden zone. Most of the Supernal Deity Kings present were at Ascension One or Ascension Two, with only a handful at Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four warriors numbered barely in the dozens, and the Ascension Five? Just a couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, maintaining his cultivation level at Ascension Two, wielded the absolute forbidden zone with such potency that it could suppress even Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings down to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the thousand Supernal Deity Kings serving Lord Malevolence, alongside the three hundred from the Jackson family, found themselves gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm! Stay calm, everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We outnumber them nearly two to one! They can't possibly stand against us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your heads!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what tricks he has up his sleeve, we're the ones who will come out on top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warrior from the Paramount Supreme Clan shouted, though his own face betrayed his rising panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight are dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all just Osborne's avatars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does this mean Osborne is still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But we saw Tanner leading a dozen elite warriors from the Jackson family, taking down Osborne and the other Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were those also avatars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As fear gripped them tighter, Osborne's voice echoed through the darkness once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outnumbered, you say? What does that matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all still going to die! One thousand three hundred Supernal Deity Kings? If you all meet your end here, the Paramount Supreme Clan will feel the sting, won't they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get this slaughter started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's true form appeared before the crowd, and in the blink of an eye, over a hundred of his Spatial Clones manifested around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following closely were Anastasia, Zoe, and others, each exuding an aura of vitality and strength, looking far from the defeated warriors they were expected to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!" Osborne commanded, waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his Spatial Clones, along with Anastasia and Zoe, sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook with the force of their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Spatial Clones possessed roughly seventy percent of his power. They had struggled against Icy Six in the past, even when Icy Six was suppressed from Ascension Six to Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against the Lord Malevolence's forces, comprised mostly of Ascension One and Two warriors, with a few at Ascension Three, they were a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What unfolded was nothing short of a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the combined forces of the Lord Malevolence's Supernal Deity Kings and the Jackson family totaling thirteen hundred, they were no match for Osborne's </span><span>Spatial Clones</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Spatial Clone barely had to face ten opponents before the tide of battle turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others quickly found themselves on the sidelines, realizing that their mere presence was unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Clones were dispatching foes faster than they could engage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of agonizing screams filled the air, but they faded quickly into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, all one thousand three hundred Supernal Deity Kings were annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even their souls escaped; they were utterly erased from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings fell into a profound quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Hudson family, HeartUnited Alliance, and Sanctum of Light stood in stunned disbelief, having witnessed a nightmarish slaughter unfold before their eyes. They watched as over a thousand Supernal Deity Kings were effortlessly wiped out, leaving them reeling from the sheer horror of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian couldn't help but gasp, his mind momentarily blank with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him as he reflected on his earlier decision&mdash;not to heed Tanner's persuasive words, not to surrender, and certainly not to betray the Human Community by siding with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had, given the power Osborne had just displayed, he would have been swiftly hunted down by Osborne's Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrifying!" Julian inhaled deeply, trying to steady his racing heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at Osborne now, all traces of pride and arrogance had vanished, replaced by a deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Tanner, who was nearly his equal in strength, had been taken down without a fight by Osborne's clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Osborne himself would likely yield the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the thought of Osborne's identity as a champion of the Human Community ignited a spark of excitement within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank the heavens for the Human Community! In our darkest hour, a talent has emerged, rivaling even the God of Night! Perhaps this time, we really can defeat Lord Malevolence and reclaim Celestara for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the others around him nodded solemnly, their expressions reflecting a newfound hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already dispatched Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight, and now he had effortlessly wiped out over a thousand Supernal Deity Kings. Each of them recognized that Osborne was indeed a prodigy on par with the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a stroke of luck for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a bittersweet edge to their elation. Osborne was still so young, and his cultivation level was relatively low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were at the same level as the God of Night&mdash;an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, then the Human Community would truly be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne reached Ascension Seven, Six, or Five, he could wield significant influence in the impending war that would involve hundreds of billions of warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, Osborne was merely at Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension One Supernal Deity King Osborne could take down Icy Six with clever tactics and use his Spatial Clones to eliminate thousands of Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the face of the impending superwar involving hundreds of billions of warriors, his influence seemed negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast army arrays composed of millions, tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of warriors, even if Osborne's power matched that of an Ascended Fourth Supernal Deity King, or even an Ascended Fifth Supernal Deity King, he still wouldn't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of such massive legion formations, even a formidable Ascension Five like Julian would have to step aside and watch from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To engage would be to court disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless one possessed the power of the God of Light or the God of Night, individual strength alone could not sway the tide of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity! If only he had another two hundred years to grow, he might truly save the Human Community!" Julian lamented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't lose hope! We still have a chance!" Jethro chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A proud smile spread across his face as he gazed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was his grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger and more talented Osborne proved to be, the prouder he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not forget, we still have the God of Light! And the God of Night! Just like a thousand years ago, they will stand against the Dark Deity Legion and buy Osborne and his allies more time to grow. This battle is ours to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Jethro and Julian jolted as a realization struck them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost forgot! The God of Light is still in the fight! We need to get to her, now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
