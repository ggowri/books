  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group listened intently as Angelo laid out the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the fog makes it difficult to see clearly. I can't get a full picture of what's up there. From what I could make out, there are only a few hundred Deathborns, mostly in the Celestial Deity and Deity Overlord realms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the group exchanged anxious glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you spot the Miracle Elixir?" one of them asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shook his head. "Not yet! It's likely that the Miracle Elixir is growing in the center of the summit. The fog is too thick for me to see clearly, but I can sense an immense energy surge and a strong medicinal aroma&mdash;at least three distinct scents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this revelation, the group's eyes widened, and their breaths quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three different scents? That means there could be at least three Miracle Elixirs up there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few hundred Deathborns? That's manageable! Even if Mr. Angelo Royston doesn't step in, we can handle this! And if there are more lurking in the fog, with Mr. Angelo Royston's help, we can definitely take them down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the Miracle Elixirs, we have to go for it! That's at least three of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo smiled, "If that's the case, let's move! We'll secure our position at the summit, clear out all the Deathborn, and then the miners can dig for the Miracle Elixirs and search for any other treasures."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But remember, Celestial Sword Peak is a sacred site for the Deathborn. If we start a fight here, the nearby nests will sense it and send reinforcements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to be quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's go!" Angelo declared, leading the charge as they climbed to the summit of Celestial Sword Peak once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angelo stepped onto the vast platform, the fog swirled thickly around him, obscuring much of the view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could make out several Deathborns crawling towards a specific point, their postures reverent and devoted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment Angelo set foot on the summit, the nearest Deathborn sensed his presence and let out a furious roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Deathborn's body exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo had struck, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar echoed across the peak, alerting all the nearby Deathborns to their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes turned red with rage as they realized intruders had dared to enter their sacred ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with the sound of enraged Deathborn as they charged at Angelo and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he struck again, taking down two of the frenzied Deathborn rushing toward him. But this time, the Deathborn were consumed by fury, their minds clouded by rage. They charged at him relentlessly, undeterred by his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others behind Angelo sprang into action, launching their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle erupted atop Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Angelo and his team held their ground, their considerable power making it easy to dispatch the first wave of Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, dozens of Deathborn bodies lay scattered before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, more Deathborn emerged from the fog, their numbers swelling from a few hundred to over a thousand, charging at them with a terrifying ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo and his team finally felt the weight of pressure bearing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick up the pace! There can't be too many Deathborns at the summit of Celestial Sword Peak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to take them all out and grab the Miracle Elixirs before we get bogged down!" Angelo shouted, determination etched on his face as he intensified his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His terrifying mind control power radiated outwards for two miles, transforming into countless blades and hammers that smashed into the approaching Deathborn, obliterating them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and the others followed suit, their strikes growing more aggressive as they carved a path toward the center of the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich aroma of medicinal herbs wafted through the air, drawing them closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scent is definitely from the Miracle Elixir!" one of them exclaimed, excitement bubbling in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the smell alone made their skin tingle, their energy surging as if they were invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by the promise of the elixirs, the group charged forward, undaunted by the onslaught of over a thousand Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of their foes were Celestial Deity level, with only a handful being Deity Overlord level, making the fight manageable&mdash;at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as they pressed on, a sense of unease began to creep in. The number of Deity Overlord Deathborn was rapidly increasing, emerging from the thick fog with a ferocity that sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angelo felt the weight of the situation shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, his brow furrowing in concern. "Looks like luck isn't on our side. We've come at the wrong time! There are far too many Deity Overlord Deathborns here at the summit. This could get tricky. How do we deal with them quickly?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
