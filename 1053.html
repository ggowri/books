  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, long time no see!" Everett greeted, surprise flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As peers from the powerful League of Divine Descent, they typically dropped the formalities and addressed each other by name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo nodded. "It has been a while! We just spoke on the phone not too long ago. What brings you here in person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over at Sin, who looked nothing like the man he remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin was disheveled, his unkempt beard and haggard appearance suggesting he had been through something really bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bloodshot eyes radiated an intense malice, and his silence was unnerving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to him?" Gerardo asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett shrugged. "Crimson is dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crimson? Dead? That's impossible! She was the third assassin of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization! With her Stealth Art, who could possibly take her down?" Gerardo exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne did it," Everett replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock coursed through Gerardo. He had no idea about this development, and his mind raced with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne's strength well. Sure, Osborne could hold his own against the peak top-tier Class S for a while, but to defeat or even kill one? That seemed far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, looking at Everett and Sin's grim expressions, Gerardo realized this was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the story?" Gerardo pressed urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin interjected, his eyes burning with rage, "Let's cut the crap! My wife is really dead, and it was Osborne who killed her! But you have to understand we were both severely injured at the time, nowhere near our peak! Osborne used some underhanded tricks to take her down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We came to find you because we want to team up&mdash;take down the Augustine family and the Draco Group! I want Osborne's head on a platter to honor my late wife and daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's voice was filled with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett quickly added, "The League of Divine Descent is on board, too. We're ready to support the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in this fight! As we discussed earlier, we need a 40% stake in the mining rights of all rare metal mines in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously invited the League of Divine Descent to join him against the Augustine family and the Draco Group, offering them the same 40% stake in the rare metal mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, they had refused, demanding a whopping 60%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never agree to that, especially since many of those mines contained the precious Divine Bone Crystal he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collaboration fell through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had been left to build his strength alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the League of Divine Descent had gone to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to negotiate with the Augustine family for a 60% share of the mining rights, only to come back empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo thought, "Back then, I didn't have the power to deal with the Augustine family and the Draco Group on my own, so I reached out for help, but you guys wanted too much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I've cloned over a thousand Class S 'Jackals', and I've successfully fused with a god's body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My strength is more than enough to take on the Augustine family and the Draco Group solo. And now you want to come crawling back for a partnership?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't hide his disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to refuse their proposal, Gerardo hesitated, weighing his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Teaming up with them might not be a bad idea! Osborne got rescued, and while I suspect it was the League of Divine Descent or the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization behind it, there's also the chance it was some mysterious powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That mysterious figure could very well be Osborne's ally! Plus, before his rescue, his physical strength had already peaked at 200. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he manages to break through to Class S, he'll be a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with my fusion with the body, I'm not sure I can contend with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization want to cooperate, it makes sense for me to join them! Bringing in some heavy hitters will definitely increase our odds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept across Gerardo's face as new possibilities unfolded in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You guys want to team up against the Augustine family and the Draco Group, right? I'm on board! And sure, I can agree to your 40% stake in the rare metal mines of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the kicker. How many people are you planning to mobilize? Just the two of you won't cut it! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You need to bring in more high-level fighters to make this work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett shared a look with Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett declared first. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The League of Divine Descent will deploy over a hundred Class S warriors, and that'll include at least three top-tier Class S warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin continued, "As for </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, we'll be sending over a hundred Class S assassins as well, with three top-tier Class S warriors."</span></p><div class="pagination">
