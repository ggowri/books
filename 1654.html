  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley was a leader of ten thousand in the Wild Flame Army, a mid-stage Deity Overlord, and in the grand scheme of Angelo's team, he felt utterly insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were more than twenty others like him, all mid-stage Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Athena, a warrior whose strength was equally formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there were ten late-stage Deity Overlords and five at the pinnacle of their realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison, one of those at the peak, stood out in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a small step away from becoming a Deity King, yet that step had eluded him for over two hundred years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his relentless efforts, he had made no progress, and he knew deep down that his potential had been exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless a miracle happened, Edison would never break through to become a Deity King, a top-tier warrior in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he had volunteered to join the expedition to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, there was a chance to obtain Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals&mdash;both of which could potentially restore his lost potential and even propel him into the ranks of Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, these treasures were incredibly rare and difficult to obtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison had spent a century at the Divine Peak Nine base, making at least ten trips to the site. He had laid eyes on Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals, but they had never been within his grasp. Trapped at the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord realm, he felt the weight of time pressing down on him, sensing that his lifespan was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he was willing to take a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, with Angelo leading the expedition deep into Divine Peak Nine, venturing 60 thousand miles to mine Celestial Crystals&mdash;it was the perfect opportunity for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to get my hands on a Celestial Crystal this time!" Edison's eyes flashed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a general in the Wild Flame Army, his authority in this team was second only to Angelo. Angelo, as a Deity King warrior, preferred to let others handle the details, which meant Edison was responsible for organizing the teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miners will be positioned at the center of our formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being closest to Mr. Angelo Royston means he can protect you better in case of danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The peak Deity Overlords will split into three groups&mdash;two at the front, two at the back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll hold the center with Mr. Angelo, ready to support you at a moment's notice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The late-stage Deity Overlords will also divide into three sections..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison quickly laid out the strategy, ensuring everyone understood their roles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the plan in place, the team set off toward Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Osborne and his group, this Deity King's team was powerful enough to fly directly using their divine power, racing toward their destination without the need for caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Deathborn sensed their presence, they dared not approach, let alone attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they soared through the skies, Angelo occasionally intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! They dare to come snooping around? They might not pose a real threat, but it's better to eliminate them now than risk them calling for reinforcements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, a blood mist erupted two miles away as a Deity Overlord Deathborn was obliterated before it even had a chance to struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others barely felt a ripple of divine power from Angelo; it was as if he was a phantom, effortlessly dispatching foes without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors looked at Angelo with a mix of admiration and envy, marveling at the sheer power he wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the warriors exclaimed, his eyes wide with awe, "That's the power of a Deity King! Two miles away, with such dense mist and the adept concealment of the Deathborn, we would've never noticed them. But Mr. Angelo Royston took them out with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exploring Divine Peak Nine with Mr. Angelo Royston feels so safe!" another added, a sense of relief washing over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, they reached Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo nonchalantly waved his hand, and several stones nearby detonated, sending blood mist swirling into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were Deathborns hiding under intricate illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their disguises had fooled Edison and the others, they were no match for Angelo's keen perception. The team was left bewildered, completely unaware of how he had detected the hidden threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their admiration for him deepened, mixed with a touch of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo smiled, savoring the adoration from his subordinates, a hint of pride evident in his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone of his caliber, these threats were barely a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors, with their limited understanding of a Deity King's true power, were simply unaware of the vast chasm between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep moving!" Angelo commanded, and the group picked up their pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborns encountered along the way were dispatched before the others even noticed them, courtesy of Angelo's swift actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley, blending into the crowd, couldn't help but feel a weight of seriousness as he observed Angelo's terrifying might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through him, Osborne also gathered intel on Angelo's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, his expression tense, "They finally reached Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity King warriors are unbelievably strong! They can spot Deathborns concealed two miles away and take them down effortlessly! Riley didn't even realize how Angelo did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he have some sort of extraordinary vision? Or can he sense their energy signatures?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's truly frightening..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's thoughts spiraled deeper into contemplation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
