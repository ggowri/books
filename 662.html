  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Medusa used Death Ash, she paid a huge price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could barely stand at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was incredibly pale. She was trembling slightly, looking so fragile that even a baby could push her over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Medusa saw Osborne turn to stone, she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him quickly. Don&rsquo;t let him live!" Medusa said, </span><span>struggling .</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to say that. We'll kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan shouted, unleashing his ultimate move as soon as Osborne was petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive body turned bright red, as if it were on fire. After gathering power for a long time, all the red light in his body rushed into his right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right fist now resembled a piece of burning rock, radiating a fiery glow. He then smashed it toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-Sacrificing Punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's entire right arm detached from his body, hurtling toward Osborne like a </span><span>massive missile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, being petrified, couldn't dodge at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only desperately unleash the martial art aura, layering defensive barriers before him. He hoped to weaken the terrifying attack from Titan, who had sacrificed his entire right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, Osborne's expression changed. All his defenses instantly crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's Self-Sacrificing Punch was far more powerful than Osborne had anticipated, much stronger than Tauren's Bull Charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Titan's right arm broke through his defenses and slammed into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent impact caused Titan's right arm to shatter completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the terrifying force had already surged into Osborne's petrified body. His body was instantly covered in countless cracks, and his internal organs were nearly shattered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suffered extremely severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was covered in blood. He was on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still not dead?" Titan exclaimed in shock when he saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at his left arm but ultimately decided not to sacrifice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolf No. Nine, it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf nodded. "Don't worry. He's already on his last legs. He's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Werewolf's body suddenly swelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a balloon inflating, his body instantly transformed into a terrifying giant wolf, over thirty feet long. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His massive jaws opened wide, seemingly capable of swallowing a house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saliva dripped from </span><span>hi</span><span>s mouth, and his sharp teeth gleamed coldly. His claws were like blades, long and sharp, as if they could easily slice an elephant in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one leap, he landed in front of Osborne and pinned him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a terrible state. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being fully petrified by Medusa and taking Titan's Self-Sacrificing Punch, he survived, which was already a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his consciousness was starting to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only see Werewolf, now a giant wolf, standing over him. His claws pinned him down, and he was looking at him like a piece of meat ready to be devoured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf's eyes were filled with contempt and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're finally about to die! Ultimately, dying by my ultimate move should make you proud! Die! Death Claw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf raised his claw, which glowed red, and slashed down at Osborne with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the presence of death looming over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his near-death state, there was no way he could defend himself. Even at his peak, he might not have been able to withstand Werewolf's ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne watched Werewolf's massive claw rapidly descending. A wild glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!" He shouted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a beam of light descended from the sky, enveloping Osborne's body in a radiance filled with life and divine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, all of Osborne's negative conditions, his near-fatal injuries, and his depleted strength were fully restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light of Redemption cleansed the petrification effect from Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The severe injury inflicted by Titan's sacrificed arm was instantly healed as if Osborne had never been hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength, worn down by the prolonged battle, was restored to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this happened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne went from the brink of death to peak condition in an instant. The martial art aura surged, and he launched a powerful punch at Werewolf's Death Claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted, and the ground split into several deep cracks. It was carved by Werewolf's Death Claw.</span></p><div class="pagination">
