  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, an awkward silence fell over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Isaac spoke up, "Well, we haven't really come up with a solid plan yet. Even at our peak, our family ranked only third in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Our main focus has always been on ensuring the survival of our lineage, not on absorbing other ancient families. So, we're a bit out of our depth here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "And... we're dealing with five ancient families&mdash;Paltrow, Walker, Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne&mdash;who have all surrendered and submitted to us. Most of them are actually stronger than we are, and their numbers are overwhelming. The Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families alone have over ten thousand direct and branch members. In total, more than fifty thousand people from these five families have surrendered to us, and we have no idea how to handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isaac finished, the others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way we can just kill all of them," one elder said, "We're not executioners. But we can't let them go, either. If even one or two of them turn out to be geniuses and break through to Class A in the future, they'll definitely come after us for revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly," another added. "We can't kill them, but we can't let them go either. It's a tough situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in discussion again, with everyone debating the best course of action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, letting them argue while he quickly thought through the situation himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare for any ancient family in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to absorb five others in one go, so it </span><span>was no surprise the Augustine family didn't know how to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were a more ruthless group, they might have simply wiped out the defeated families to prevent future retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither Osborne nor the Augustine family could do something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were talking about fifty thousand people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the most intense wars, one wouldn't see that many casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the five ancient families had conspired with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, not all of them were guilty. Most were just ordinary members of the family, innocent of any crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing them wasn't an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was not like the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could they prevent these people from seeking revenge in the future? And was there a way to even turn them into allies for the Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an idea struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my Satan's Eye could reach six-star, I'd gain a new ability&mdash;Memory Control. Memory Control is a form of mental attack, but it's more insidious. It can alter an enemy's memories or even implant commands directly into their minds. If I could upgrade Satan's Eye to six-star, I could change the memories of these people from the five ancient families. I could even command them to be loyal to the Augustine family forever! Unless their mental strength surpasses mine, they wouldn't be able to disobey my orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, Osborne knew what he had to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand, and the noisy conference room fell silent immediately. Everyone stopped talking and turned their attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've figured out a solution," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are too many people from the five ancient families, so we can't just kill them or let them go. For now, we'll keep them under control and make sure they can't escape. After that, I'll take care of things and ensure that they pose no threat to the Augustine family. In fact, I'll turn them into allies, loyal vassals of our family. As for how I plan to do this, I'll need to keep that to myself for now. Just trust me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, of course, we trust you!" one elder said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for you, where would our family be today? We might not even exist anymore!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. We trust you completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you decided to kill them all, we'd support you. I'd personally take on the role of executioner and bear the blame myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said you'd take the blame alone? I'd share it with you!" another elder chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, we have full faith in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one voiced any objections. Even though Osborne hadn't explained his method, they trusted him implicitly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found this trust deeply gratifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was starting to feel a strong sense of belonging to the Augustine family and even felt a twinge of reluctance at the thought of leaving the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew that he would have to leave eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his hunch was correct, once his sixth trial began, he'd be required to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston</span><span> no longer had anything left to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was in control of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>&mdash;its ruler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to make sure that all potential threats to the Augustine family are eliminated before I leave. Where will I go next? Could it be Newport City?" Osborne mused as he walked out of the meeting hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at his Draco Star Wristlet, hoping for his reward, but it hadn't arrived yet. He felt a pang of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reward for completing the fifth trial would surely include a way to upgrade Satan's Eye to six-star. Once he had that, he'd be able to deal with the people from the five ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa is deep in her breakthrough. I don't want to disturb her. Maybe I'll pay Isa a visit," he thought, a vivid image of Isa's soft lips and ample curves flashing in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sudden rush of heat, Osborne didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</span></p><div class="pagination">
