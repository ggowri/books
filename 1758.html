  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I'm about to break through to the Deity King realm!" Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the incredible power of the Infinite Devouring Eyes and the extraordinary energy from the root, he sensed that the moment for his breakthrough was at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of hesitation, he quickly left Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was concerned that the commotion accompanying his breakthrough would be massive. Although Hope Haven spanned a radius of 3000 miles, he doubted it could withstand the force of his ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, during the breakthroughs of Zoe, Bryce, and others, the ground had trembled significantly, and Osborne's own breakthrough would likely be ten times more intense. The last thing he wanted was to accidentally destroy Hope Haven in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he made the decision to leave the Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to attempt his breakthrough in Celestara, either, fearing that the colossal disturbance might attract unwanted attention&mdash;especially from the Shadow Terror Fiend or the root creatures lurking in Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone decided to strike while he was in a vulnerable state, it could spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Osborne found a perfect spot for his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll break through in the Dimensional Space! But I must avoid the deeper areas; I encountered those root creatures there last time, and it's just too dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he tore through the fabric of space and entered the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This region was considered a shallow layer, a void filled with swirling colors and shimmering lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, scanning the surroundings to ensure there were no threats before settling down cross-legged to prepare for his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through to the Deity King level meant facing the Deity King Tribulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger one's talent and potential, the more formidable the tribulation would be. Generally, however, the Deity King Tribulation wasn't too difficult to endure&mdash;at least, Osborne had never witnessed anyone perish during it; most only suffered injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!" he murmured, channeling his power as he surged toward the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it felt as though he had pushed open a massive door. A colossal force surrounded him, compressing the energy within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, thick, dark clouds suddenly materialized in the void of the Dimensional Space, swirling ominously above him like ink, expanding rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Deity King Tribulation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't think much of it at first. He had witnessed Zoe, Mila, and others go through their breakthroughs and knew this was a normal occurrence. He just had to wait for the tribulation to pass, and he would emerge as a true Deity King, with his Divine Body undergoing a significant transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But gradually, he sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swirling clouds above him were growing too large. Within just a few breaths, their reach had expanded to a radius of over 600 miles, and it was still accelerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Bryce and Diana had Deity King Tribulations that only spanned about 600 miles! Kendra, Zoe, Mila, and Hannah had slightly larger ones, but they stayed within 1200 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And mine... it's already reached a radius of 1800 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-five hundred miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty hundred miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty-seven hundred miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clouds continued to swell, and Osborne's expression turned grave. He felt an overwhelming pressure bearing down on him. Thank goodness he hadn't attempted his breakthrough in Hope Haven; if this terrifying Deity King Tribulation had unfolded there, it could have easily obliterated the entire place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Still growing? Forty-three hundred miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty hundred miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-six hundred miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixty-two hundred miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's scalp prickled with unease as his Deity King Tribulation quickly expanded to a radius of 6</span><span>,</span><span>200 miles and showed no sign of stopping, continuing to grow at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark clouds above swirled menacingly, whipping up fierce winds and flashing lightning that created an apocalyptic scene, leaving him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Twelve thousand miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighteen thousand miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty-four thousand miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was starting to feel numb as the endless clouds overhead exerted a terrifying pressure, making his body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the expansion showed no sign of abating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne's Deity King Tribulation reached a staggering 42 thousand miles in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, it didn't stop, continuing to spread at a slower pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, it reached a massive 60 thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A devastating bolt of lightning smashed down, striking Osborne's Divine Body with unparalleled force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the lightning was beyond his expectations; despite his Divine Body being at peak Level Nine, it was obliterated by the catastrophic strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, his Divine Body, Soul Current Ocean, divine power essence, elemental essence&mdash;everything was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity remained, swirling frantically in its place.</span></p><div class="pagination">
