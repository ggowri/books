  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the heart of Apocalypse City, on Apocalypse Island, within the Baxter family compound, Trevor looked at the dozen or so people before him. His voice was calm as he said, "Time's almost up. Remember what I told you. Work with me and help rescue my son, Kurt, and I'll let bygones be bygones. But if anything goes wrong, all of you will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's faces turned pale, terror written all over them. They nodded hastily. "Yes, sir. Don't worry. We'll follow your instructions to the letter. As long as that 'Theodore' shows up, we guarantee he won't escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor gave a slight nod. "Let's go. Time's running out. I'll take you there." As he finished speaking, a surge of power enveloped the group, lifting them effortlessly. They then sped off toward Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from Astral Wolf Peak, in a dense forest, Osborne sat cross-legged on the ground, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I wonder if Trevor will bring out the Hammer of Thor to trade for his son. Logically, lightning elemental Ultimate Divine Artifacts are incredibly rare. Even for someone like Trevor, a Supernal Deity King, it's unlikely he owns three of them. If he's serious about saving Kurt, he'll have to bring out the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, there's always a chance things won't go as expected. If Trevor doesn't offer the Hammer, I'll need another plan. At the very least, walking away with ten sets of Ultimate Luminous Armor wouldn't be bad&mdash;it'd definitely make the Baxter family feel the sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Trevor isn't going to play nice and just trade with me. He's bound to have a backup plan. I need to be cautious. After all, we're talking about a Supernal Deity King here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as he thought it through. However, he wasn't overly worried. The reason he dared propose this deal was his spatial power. Known as the ultimate escape ability, spatial power meant that even someone like Trevor couldn't pin him down. Still, to be on the safe side, Osborne decided to send his Spatial Clone to handle the trade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time's almost up," Osborne muttered under his breath. Soon, a Spatial Clone materialized beside him, holding the unconscious Kurt. The next moment, the clone grabbed Kurt and shot into the sky, heading for the peak of Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the crowd floating in midair was engaged in a lively debate. Someone spoke up, "So, what do you think? Will Theodore have the guts to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "Who exactly is this Theodore? He actually dared to kidnap Kurt&mdash;he's got some serious guts! Doesn't he know that Kurt's father is a Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else scoffed, "Probably some lunatic. Risking it all for ten pieces of Luminous Armor and not even fearing a Supernal Deity King? Ignorance really is bliss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another voice chimed in, "I bet he doesn't dare show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly," someone agreed, "no way he'll come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne's spatial clone soared into the sky, carrying Kurt effortlessly, and landed swiftly on Astral Wolf Peak. The buzz of conversation around them fell silent in an instant. Those who had just confidently claimed Osborne wouldn't dare show up looked like they'd been slapped in the face&mdash;faces flushed red with embarrassment, wishing they could disappear into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the crowd, two people had very different reactions. Their expressions changed drastically&mdash;Alicia and Nadia, Osborne's two aunts. They exchanged a quick glance, their eyes filled with shock and panic. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two began whispering urgently through their telepathic connection. "Didn't Zachary just say he convinced Osborne not to leave Hudson Valley, let alone risk coming to Astral Wolf Peak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He even told us to show up here just for appearances..." Nadia said, her voice sharp with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia frowned, "Who is this guy then? Is that really Osborne? What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia tried to stay calm, replying, "What else can we do? Contact Zachary immediately and find out what's going on. Make sure Osborne is still in Hudson Valley. If that really is Osborne... we've got a big problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia nodded. "Right. Let's contact him now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ending their exchange, Alicia and Nadia wasted no time reaching out to Zachary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you saying 'Theodore' showed up? And he brought Kurt to Astral Wolf Peak?" Zachary's disbelief was palpable. "That's impossible. Osborne is still in Hudson Valley. I've got Virgil keeping an eye on him&mdash;he just reported back that Osborne was strolling around the training grounds not too long ago. Hold on. I'll go check this out myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxious, Zachary rushed toward the training grounds. It didn't take long for him to spot 'Osborne.' Sure enough, 'Osborne' was casually wandering around, with Virgil watching him from a short distance, trying to remain inconspicuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne there, Zachary let out a sigh of relief. But the thought of 'Theodore' appearing at Astral Wolf Peak made him frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?" Zachary wondered. "Could it be that the 'Theodore' at Astral Wolf Peak isn't Osborne in disguise? Or... is this Osborne in front of me a fake? Well, there's only one way to find out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to get to the bottom of it, he landed right in front of Osborne and greeted him with a grin. "Hey, Osborne, I've been itching for a fight. How about a quick sparring session?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Zachary and couldn't help but let out a bitter smile. His spatial clone was almost indistinguishable from the real deal and moved in perfect sync with his thoughts. There was no chance of being exposed by appearance alone. However, the clone had one glaring weakness&mdash;it could only use spatial powers. The moment it fought, its true nature would be revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne didn't turn him down. "Sure," he said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
