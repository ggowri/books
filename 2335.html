  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's voice echoed through the air, Agatha snapped her eyes open in a split-second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rose to her feet, her statuesque figure exuding an air of both grace and might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes swept over Osborne, sizing him up from head to toe, her scrutiny as thorough as a detective on a high-stakes case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the seventh layer, though she could hear Osborne's voice, she hadn't been able to open her eyes to catch a glimpse of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in a way, this was truly their first face-to-face encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was undeniably good-looking, and a flicker of satisfaction started to stir within her, but she quickly squashed it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I've been waiting for you ages!" Agatha declared, her voice brimming with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arched an eyebrow but kept his lips sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively got why Agatha was so eager; after all, they were the only two survivors in the seventh layer during the entire state duel, so she was well-aware of his prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne also took a long, hard look at Agatha's face, trying to read her expression like a book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After all, I did take nine drops of her Phoenix Blood... She can't be holding a grudge, can she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, her calm demeanor gave nothing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, he finally spoke up, "I've been itching for this fight too! Let's put an end to this once and for all. Just make sure you bring your A-game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha nodded vigorously. "You bet! I've whipped myself into shape for this fight. I'm ready to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she let loose a powerful wave of battle-ready energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson exchanged quick, knowing looks, a wry smile appearing on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha's made up her mind to take on someone else. She thinks we're not up to the mark to be her final foe. Clearly, the one she's gunning for is Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit them like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the state duel started, they all thought they were in the same league. But now, the pecking order of strength was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha stood head and shoulders above the rest, at least a whole notch stronger than Horace. And Horace, thanks to his Frost-invoking Canvas, had an upper hand over Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, his ascent was a real curve-ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before the state duel, he was outside the top hundred, and no one gave him a snowball's chance in hell of going up against the top four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he'd taken out Benson, Broderick, and Horace one after another, proving that he was the only real thorn in Agatha's side in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her earlier words rang true; she'd seen Osborne's potential from the get-go and had been waiting for this showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with anticipation, not just for Broderick and Benson, but for the millions of folks watching from Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who'd have ever guessed that the showdown for the championship would boil down to Agatha and Osborne? I mean, it ain't Benson, nor Broderick, and definitely not Horace. It's Osborne! Crazy, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who said Osborne didn't stand a chance against Horace, you better step up right now! Horace didn't have a snowball's chance in hell against him. He got taken out with just three arrows! That's how dominant Osborne was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Horace's so-called best weapon, the Frost-invoking Canvas? It was a dud against Agatha and completely useless against Osborne. It might as well have been a piece of junk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we all got carried away and overestimated the power of that Frost-invoking Canvas, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Finally, we're at the peak of the state duel! Both Osborne and Agatha have broken the ten-million-point barrier. The winner of this epic battle will scoop up one-tenth of the other's score. And that'll be the deciding factor for who walks away with the championship title!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne comes out on top, he'll be the champ, plain and simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Agatha wins, she retains her title and proves once again she's the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the arena was electric, with spectators perched on the edge of their seats, eagerly awaiting the explosive confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Angela felt the weight of her nerves more than anyone else. Watching Osborne face off against Agatha left her momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the state duel kicked off, all she had hoped for was for him to break into the top one hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody from the Mystic Sirius Sect had ever accomplished anything noteworthy in this competition, and within Tempest Fortress City, no one had even made it to the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here he was, contesting for the championship title!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few days, she'd heard people talking about Osborne left and right. A sense of pride welled up inside her, but it was laced with jitters.</span><br><span>What if he isn't a match for Agatha and ends up losing the title?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he'd come this far, and it'd be a fib to say Agatha wasn't eyeing that championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clasped her hands tight and sent up a silent prayer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne tightened his grip on his Bloodwrought Bow and locked gazes with Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're all set, let the battle commence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolve was like a fire, burning hotter and hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was a force to be reckoned with, especially after her Dark Phoenix Bloodline had unexpectedly kicked in during the seventh layer, giving her a serious power boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't help but feel a tad unsure; he had no clue what aces she had up her sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this fight on!" Agatha's fighting spirit flared up like a wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields spun around her, forming an unyielding barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, she raised the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute to her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, the piercing cry of a phoenix echoed through the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This single move alone showed how seriously Agatha was taking this fight. She was approaching it with kid-gloves, a far cry from her previous match against Horace, where she'd let Osborne take the first swing. This time, she was coming out of the gate guns blazing, unleashing her full might right from the get-go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just started to raise his Bloodwrought Bow to retaliate when, all of a sudden, he was hit with a bone-chilling soul attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a tsunami crashing into his Soul Current Ocean, making it roil and boil as if it were on the verge of erupting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, his eyes clouded with confusion, and his body went stiff as a board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This turn of events sent a shockwave through Clara and Leroy. Their faces went as pale as a ghost, panic written all over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson exchanged rueful grins, remembering how they'd been caught off-guard by Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and quickly shown the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Horace could withstand the attack of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute thanks to the effects of the Soul Essence Herb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had their eyes glued to Agatha and Osborne, holding their breath in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What is Osborne going to do now? Is he going to meet the same sorry end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Suddenly, a cold scoff cut through the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sharpened, and the fog of confusion lifted. He stared at Agatha, his eyes wide with surprise at the raw power of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, what a killer soul attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Luckily, my soul power's no slouch. And my Soul Current Ocean has been merged with the Primordial for ages, making it as solid as a rock. Otherwise, I'd have been blindsided and easily taken out&mdash;or even worse, six feet under!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his mind, a steely determination settled on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this vast world, there were hordes of powerful beings lurking around every corner. No one could claim to be the big cheese, invincible and untouchable. One wrong move, like underestimating an opponent, and one could find oneself biting the dust in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resolve as solid as a rock, he pulled back the string of his Bloodwrought Bow, his eyes locked firmly on Agatha like a hawk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's your turn to feel the heat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
