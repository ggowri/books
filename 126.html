  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, Osborne slowly woke up and opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are awake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle voice of Austin startled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around and found himself lying on a large bed, stark naked under the covers. He was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, meanwhile, seemed to have just come out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was drying her long hair with a towel, looking at Osborne with a teasing expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I doing here?" Osborne stammered, his face stiff with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin laughed, "Osborne, do not tell me you have forgotten everything? You would be missing out big time if you did. Such a wonderful memory, and you do not remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at her, shocked by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered exactly what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "But considering what happened, should not Austin be furious? Should not she be slapping me and telling me to get lost, never to forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did she mean by this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin put down her towel and walked to the bedside. Seeing the anxiety on Osborne's face, she could not help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you do not have to blame yourself. It was not your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were both drunk. If you want to blame someone, blame me. I was the one who kissed you first, who undressed you first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was true, he was still a man, and Austin was a woman. Seeing the bloodstain on the bed, Osborne realized that it was Austin's first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had taken her virginity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, not expecting this to happen. He thought, " I had just met Austin yesterday. We got along well, but it was just our first meeting. And now this...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Osborne gritted his teeth and said, "Austin, I am sorry! No matter what, I failed to control myself and hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do not worry. If you need me to, I will take responsibility. I am not the type to shirk my duties or run away from my responsibilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne finished speaking, Austin burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, why are you so serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And you want to take responsibility? I do not want you to. I am the sole heir of the Montague family. If you want to marry me, my family would not allow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, but then he said earnestly, "Then I will work hard! I know you are from a noble family. I will work hard to reach your level and be worthy of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin shook her head. "Osborne, you have misunderstood. I am not saying you are not worthy of me. I am saying I will never get married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the only heir of the Montague family, if I get married, it would be like giving away the family business. From the start, I never planned on marrying, and my family would not allow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin continued, "Although I do not plan to marry, I still need to have a child to carry on the Montague family line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was thinking of choosing the best sperm from a sperm bank for artificial insemination, though the idea disgusts me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I do not have to do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne and smiled, "This unexpected event solved my problem! I do not dislike you, so I will just borrow your sperm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Borrow my sperm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin nodded, "Yes, borrow your sperm. Once I am pregnant, we would not interfere in each other's lives. I would not bother you, nor will I disrupt your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I will never admit that my child's father is you. If you consider me a friend, please do not tell anyone about this. Can you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin pleaded slightly as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind was in turmoil. He thought, "Austin wanted to borrow my sperm to have a child and carry on the Montague family line?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Austin got pregnant, I would have a child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she asked me to keep it as a secret?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can you do that? If it makes you uncomfortable, I can give you some compensation," Austin said pitifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment and continued, "But you do not seem to need money. What compensation can I give you? You are the father, and it would be cruel to deny your child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I become your lover? But not too often, or my family will find out, and we will both be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Austin finished speaking, Osborne's body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Austin, who had just showered, and her beautiful face and fiery body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swallowed hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin blushed, knowing what Osborne was thinking. She bit her lip and suddenly untied her robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I will compensate you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more time will make it easier to conceive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin pushed Osborne down and straddled him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
