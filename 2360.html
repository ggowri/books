  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After collecting the Warfare Ancient Tree, the surrounding Warfare Mist dissipated. Within their field of vision, they could no longer see anything of value.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Osborne still wanted to continue exploring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Sacredness Level warship they were on was rapidly exploring ahead. The Ascending Sacred Sanctum had already been placed on the Warfare Ancient Tree by Osborne, letting the Warfare Ancient Tree help restore it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne also fed the Empyrean Sacredness-level skeleton to the Warfare Ancient Tree. The Warfare Ancient Tree rooted itself on the skeleton, completely enveloping it and absorbing its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clearly felt that with the power of the Empyrean Sacredness-level skeleton, the Warfare Ancient Tree began to grow rapidly. At the same time, the various Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree were also slowly increasing in power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum was also being slowly repaired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Warfare Ancient Tree is truly something amazing," Osborne sighed once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't been unexpectedly trapped by the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, he wouldn't have come here, nor would he have obtained the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, he would hardly be able to repair the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the various materials needed to repair the Ascending Sacred Sanctum alone were enough to overwhelm him. Even if he spent a lot of time, he might not be able to gather them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Warfare Ancient Tree only needed enough Sacred Power to complete all the repairs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Standing on the warship's deck, Osborne observed the outside, hoping to come across some more good things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This warship was also a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. It wasn't as high-level as the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, but it was intact. After Osborne refined it, its power was comparable to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and even stronger in some aspects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&#33267;&#23569;&#65292;</span><span>Osborne</span><span>&#21487;&#20197;&#29992;</span><span>Sacred Power</span><span>&#39537;&#21160;&#36825;</span><span>&#20010;</span><span>&#25112;&#33328;</span><span>&#65292;&#20351;&#20854;&#29190;</span><span>&#21457;</span><span>&#20986;&#24456;&#22823;&#30340;&#23041;&#21147;&#65292;&#21253;&#25324;</span><span>&#26497;&#24378;</span><span>&#30340;&#36895;&#24230;&#12289;&#38450;&#24481;&#21147;&#21644;&#25915;</span><span>&#20987;</span><span>&#21147;&#12290;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne named this warship Solar Battleship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, there shouldn't be anything else here," Agatha said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a pause, she continued, "Our gains this time are already enormous. Just this Solar Battleship alone is far superior to the main warships of many Second-rate Powers. Only those First-rate Powers can produce warships of this level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we put it up for auction, it could sell for at least tens of millions of Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was equally satisfied and said with a smile, "It does seem like there's nothing good left here. I guess I was a bit too greedy. We've gained so many treasures this time, yet I still want more. Unfortunately, I'm still missing a Sacred Artifact to support me in close combat."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of four Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree. He obtained the Solar Battleship and the Warfare Shield. Primordial acquired the World Spear. Agatha named her warblade the Vengeance Warblade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to avenge the members of the Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still hadn't found a Sacred Artifact to support him in close combat. He thought, "It seems I'll have to rely on the Warfare Ancient Tree for help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, growing a Sacred Artifact would consume a significant amount of the Warfare Ancient Tree's power and time. But since I can't find another one, I have no choice but to do this. A close-combat Sacred Artifact crafted by the Warfare Ancient Tree according to my wishes will definitely suit me better."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne immediately communicated with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first decided on the weapon form he wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dagger, longsword, saber, spear, or gauntlet?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Various weapon forms flashed quickly through Osborne's mind, but he disliked them all. Finally, a weapon shape suddenly appeared in Osborne's mind. "Scythe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A divine artifact appeared in his hand, the Goddess of Grain's scythe, which he had used for a long time on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe was already too ordinary for Osborne now. After all, it was merely a top-grade divine artifact. Osborne no longer needed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne had deep feelings for the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, when he was still weak, the sharp and sturdy Goddess of Grain's scythe had helped him defeat strong enemies time and again, even helping him survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even now, Osborne still carried this scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became excited, thinking, "In that case, I can have the Warfare Ancient Tree grow a new scythe-shaped Sacred Artifact based on the form of the Goddess of Grain's scythe. Or, I can directly place it on the Warfare Ancient Tree and let it help enhance, modify, and upgrade it. This might save some time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shared his idea with the Warfare Ancient Tree. The Warfare Ancient Tree immediately understood and agreed to help Osborne enhance and upgrade the Goddess of Grain's scythe, adding the abilities Osborne desired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed the Goddess of Grain's scythe on the trunk of the Warfare Ancient Tree. Instantly, he felt the Warfare Ancient Tree channel most of its power into it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel the quality and level of the Goddess of Grain's scythe rapidly improving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, I'll call you Warfare Scythe," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the Warfare Scythe upgrades to a Sacred Artifact, I will have the Bloodwrought Bow, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, Solar Battleship, and Ascending Sacred Sanctum&mdash;five Sacred Artifacts. That's enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter who I compare with at the same cultivation level, I shouldn't be at a disadvantage in terms of Sacred Artifacts. Next, I need to keep improving my strength." Thinking this, Osborne looked outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there was still nothing outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "It's time for us to head back. I don't know how long we've been drifting in the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. I just hope we haven't missed the zone duel. Let's return."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He infused the Solar Battleship with time powers, increasing its speed, and steered it back to the position where he had entered deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, as long as he tears the space, he can return to the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Fortunately, that Chrono-Spatial Turbulence didn't take us too far. At this speed, we'll be back in at most three days. Plus, we'll pass by Elf City on the way."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Elf City, Osborne couldn't help but think of Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne is already an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, but he still has no way to resurrect Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was killed by Isidore, the master of the Ethereal Elven Temple. Although Osborne had previously copied Alfreda's life essence, Isidore's strength was too overwhelming, and Osborne's cultivation level was too low, so he couldn't resurrect Alfreda immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isidore," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes filled with coldness, he thought, "Since I'm passing by Elf City, I can check out the situation there. Isidore won't easily give up after I took the Ascending Sacred Sanctum from him. Most importantly, Alfreda and I are one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Isidore can't find me, he might resent Alfreda. And Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood are still in Elf City. Could Isidore target them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit worried and decided to go to Elf City to check if Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was killed by Isidore to save Osborne. If the three of them were targeted or killed by Isidore because of this, Osborne wouldn't know how to face Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "I hope they're okay."</span></p><div class="pagination">
