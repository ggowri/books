  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's frantic voice echoed as he and his four companions managed to escape hundreds of feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed as he let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can get away? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to chase after them when suddenly, a figure moved even faster than he did, intercepting Reginald and his group of five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Sebastian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian shouted, his voice booming like thunder as he swung the Godfather's scepter. A terrifying burst of energy erupted, sending all five of the top-tier Class S warriors, including Reginald, stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the force of the attack caused Sebastian's face to turn pale, and a trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett roared in disbelief, his face contorted with rage. He had never expected that just when they were on the brink of escape, Sebastian would block their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Didn't Gerardo say that Sebastian was gravely injured, that even if he survived, he would be powerless to fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet here he is, stopping all five of us top-tier Class S warriors with his strength alone? Sebastian's power is even greater than it was before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, he looks younger than he did a few months ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was stunned, but there was no time to dwell on these thoughts. They had just barely broken through the encirclement of the Blood Demon members. If they hadn't escaped now and had been surrounded again, they would have been finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We mustn't let him hold us up. Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett charged straight at Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sneered, "Since we are already mortal enemies, you might as well all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the Godfather's scepter once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his strength had returned to its peak, perhaps even beyond, it was impossible for him to take on five top-tier Class S warriors alone, especially with Reginald among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald was ranked in the top twenty on the Quasi-Divine Rankings, a formidable force in his own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in a one-on-one fight, Sebastian had no guarantee of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, in breaking through the Blood Demon members' encirclement, Reginald and his companions had expended a great deal of energy. They were still recovering and were far from their best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's goal was merely to stall them for a brief moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was forced back by a powerful blow, his body thrown backward. His face grew even paler, and he sustained additional injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a faint spatial fluctuation appeared in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly appeared behind Sebastian, catching him and steadying his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, are you okay?" Osborne asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian smiled, shaking his head, "I'm fine! I won't die that easily! But these five are all top-tier Class S warriors. We can't let them escape; they'll be a huge problem in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Don't worry, Grandfather. They won't get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his icy gaze toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesson, Bryce, Greyson, Roy, Miranda, Fiona, Ashley, and all Class S warriors rushed to join them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had wanted to join the battle earlier, but with the Blood Demon members handling the main fight, they had no opening. Now that Everett and his group had broken through the encirclement, they immediately moved to support Osborne and Sebastian, encircling the five warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions on Reginald and his group's faces turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, seeing that the Blood Demon members were not pursuing them, a glimmer of hope appeared in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you're courting death! Do you really think that just a few of you can hold us off? Besides you, the rest are merely ordinary Class S warriors, and you dare to stand in our way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to die, we'll grant your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald roared, launching a fierce attack, aiming straight at Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could act, Osborne stepped forward, blocking Reginald's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, let me handle him!" Osborne said calmly. "I've been wanting to see just how strong a warrior ranked in the top twenty of the Quasi-Divine Rankings really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed a powerful punch, dissipating Reginald's attack entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a few steps back, feeling the tremendous force course through his body, but it was still within his limits. A grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched himself at Reginald, his attacks swift and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's eyes flared with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You arrogant brat! You think you can stop me? I'll kill you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Reginald were locked in a ferocious battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Everett and the other three warriors launched their own assaults, each attempting to break through the blockade in different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian snorted and moved swiftly to intercept Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, if you want to escape, you'll have to get past me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, now seething with anger, yelled, "Then let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Wesson, Bryce, Greyson, Roy, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley, all seven Class S warriors, desperately tried to stop the remaining three top-tier Class S warriors from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But apart from Bryce, the others were noticeably outmatched by these top-tier opponents. They were quickly losing ground in the intense confrontation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
