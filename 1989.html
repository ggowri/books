  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd present couldn't help but feel a surge of surprise as they glanced over the roster for the upcoming border competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence bubbled within them, for it was clear that the various factions had laid their cards on the table this time, showcasing their finest and most talented individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every participant in the border competition was a name they had heard of&mdash;a genius renowned in their respective cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meticulous selection process by the God of Light, these talents were paired with suitable weapons, gear, and even armor tailored to their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an impressive lineup, how could they possibly lose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, our Human Community is bound to win! We'll show Paramount Supreme Clan and Dark Deity Legion that our talents are just as formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! We're going to shatter their confidence!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community will triumph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement in the room was palpable, and everyone was eager for the competition to commence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the God of Light remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke up, her voice steady, "Everyone, let's not get too overconfident. While our team is indeed composed of the best from the Human Community, so is the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our opponents are backed by the Paramount Supreme Clan, which boasts a far greater number of talents than we do. They possess the majority of the Celestara territory, giving them access to resources we simply can't match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even with our carefully curated team of geniuses, winning the border competition will be extremely challenging&mdash;almost impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words cast a heavy silence over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earlier excitement evaporated, replaced by a sobering realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, the Human Community was sending their best, but would that be enough against the might of the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in strength between the Human Community and the Dark Deity Legion was significant, and it wouldn't simply vanish once the competition was reduced to a stage. In fact, the gap could widen even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, the stronger side remained the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the Human Community needed to focus on was minimizing their losses and winning as many matches as possible to buy time&mdash;not on shattering the Dark Deity Legion's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a pipe dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a figure at the front spoke up, "The esteemed God of Light makes a valid point! We're certainly at a disadvantage, but the roster we've assembled is the strongest we could muster. We shouldn't underestimate ourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, they will undoubtedly bring glory to the Human Community and boost our morale!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words resonated with many, igniting a renewed wave of discussion among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was Tanner Jackson, head of the Jackson family, the most powerful among the ten Dukedom Level Families of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were often regarded as the first family of the Human Community. Tanner himself was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, a powerhouse whose strength was unrivaled in the room&mdash;no one dared to claim they could best him besides the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People nodded in agreement with Tanner's assertion, finding solace in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light shot him a glance, her lips parting as if to speak, but she ultimately held her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there are no objections, we'll proceed as planned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Light vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand hall, the crowd buzzed with conversation about the roster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Tanner turned his gaze toward Jethro, who lingered in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner called, his tone sharp, "Everyone, quiet down! With time still on our side before the battle begins, I have a question for Mr. Jethro Hudson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes shifted to Jethro, who looked just as surprised as the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could Tanner want from him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Tanner's demeanor suggested he wasn't there to exchange pleasantries&mdash;he seemed ready to challenge Jethro directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro furrowed his brow and spoke up, "Mr. Tanner Jackson, what exactly is it that you wish to ask me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner let out a scoff, his expression turning hostile. "Mr. Jethro Hudson, my question for you is quite straightforward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this border competition, various factions have worked hard to collaborate, submitting their most qualified talents for the esteemed God of Light to select.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all know participating is a high-risk endeavor&mdash;it could lead to irreversible consequences, even death in the arena!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nevertheless, we have all agreed to this in pursuit of a brighter future for the Human Community, for the sake of our dignity and victory in this war... I even signed my own son up for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, heads nodded throughout the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Tanner's sons, known geniuses within the Human Community, were present on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most had reached the pinnacle of Deity King level, with a few having already broken through to become Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their names adorned the roster with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tanner Jackson serves as an example of moral integrity! He risked his own son for the sake of the Human Community, ignoring the potential for danger and death to bring glory to us all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tanner Jackson is our role model!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives from various factions offered their praises, applauding Tanner's commitment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner smiled slightly, bowing his head in acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, everyone. But let's not inflate my ego here; I know each of you has similarly recommended your own close individuals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tanner's gaze returned to Jethro, his tone growing colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's one thing I find puzzling about Mr. Jethro Hudson. Why is it that the Hudson family has not a single name on this list?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family is a Dukedom Level Power, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sons and daughters are renowned talents within the Human Community! Not to mention your grandson... In short, there are plenty of geniuses in the Hudson family. So why is it I see no Hudson family names here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it that you, Mr. Jethro Hudson, are unwilling to let them take the risk? Unwilling to allow them to step into the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This border competition is a matter of life and death for the entire Human Community! Why, at such a critical moment, does the Hudson family still keep its talents hidden?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the Hudson family's life somehow more valuable than that of our other factions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tanner's voice rose and his agitation grew, he pointed directly at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I'm asking for right now is an explanation! We all demand an explanation! Why isn't anyone from the Hudson family participating in the border competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you not submit the names of your family's geniuses to the esteemed God of Light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is there some other reason behind this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Tanner's words hanging thick in the air, gasps of astonishment erupted from the crowd as they checked the list again. True enough, there was not a single name associated with the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eyes of every observer turned to Jethro, a mix of anger and disdain in their gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the Hudson family backing down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Jethro's concerns about the dangers of the border competition led him to withhold his family's talents, fearing they might perish in the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes burned with fury as they awaited Jethro's response.</span></p><div class="pagination">
