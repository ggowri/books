  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was gravely injured. The doctors on the ship had all given up on her, deeming she wouldn't be able to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evelyn still held onto hope. She went to Osborne and begged him to help Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her efforts paid off. Ophelia was granted a new lease on life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne came to fully realize that Isa was indeed a top-tier doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Isa's treatment, Ophelia survived, and after some rest, she recovered fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's medical prowess left the other doctors in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gathered around Isa, eager to learn from her, but she paid them no mind. After the treatment, she gave Osborne a nod and returned to her cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sat at the edge of her bed, her face dark with displeasure as she stared at Osborne, and her eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how much I expected from you? Your actions today, your weakness towards her, have truly disappointed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before murmuring, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa waved a hand dismissively. "Apology is useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused briefly, then looked directly at Isa and asked, "Isa, have you ever been in love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was taken aback, frowning as she asked, "Why are you asking that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scoffed lightly, answering with indifference, "Never. What's the point of love? It's a complete waste of time. I'd rather spend that time finding more test subjects and uncovering that lock sooner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. "I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa asked irritably, "What are you getting at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose. "Isa, you've never been in love, so you don't understand why I went soft. I know I disappointed you today, and I'm sorry for that. But I promise you, this will be the last time I show any softness towards Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I will never be soft towards our enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne waved his hand and left Isa's cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stared blankly at his retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did he mean by that? Is he mocking me for never having been in love, implying that I don't understand love? He is so ridiculous..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Isa thought about it, the angrier she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so great about love? It's not like I can't experience it. I just choose not to waste my time on it! If I wanted, I could have countless men falling for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph, that man knows nothing at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Isa thought about it, the more upset she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Love, love..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa became increasingly agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was completely oblivious to Isa's emotions. He had just casually mentioned that since she'd never been in love, she wouldn't understand why he acted as he did. He had no clue his words would provoke such a strong reaction from Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if he had known, he wouldn't have cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to his room, finally ready to cultivate with peace of mind. Gripping the blood diamonds, he began to cultivate in earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, he planned to track down that ancient ship and locate the Ghost Ship's hiding place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship was shrouded in mystery, and Osborne had no idea how many experts might be aboard. Thus, every bit of strength he gained now would add to his future security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had disappointed Isa today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he encountered a true powerhouse and Isa either refused to help him or was too late to save him, he would undoubtedly suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, I won't rely on Isa for anything I can handle myself!" Osborne resolved inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, working to absorb the power of the blood diamonds into his body. Enduring intense pain, he felt his strength gradually increase, inching closer to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Isa had delayed treating Ophelia, she still managed to prepare the antidote in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At ten o'clock that night, Osborne was ready to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, apart from Kendra, he didn't plan on bringing anyone else. Jacob, Layla, Ryan, and Nathan were all to stay on the cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning of this, Yulissa immediately became displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung tightly to Osborne's arm. "Osborne, take me with you! I have to go! They're the ones who killed my father. I'm his daughter, his only descendant. I must avenge him myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, please, take me with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can take Kendra, so why not me? I know I'm not very strong, but Kendra is even weaker than I am!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't take me, I'll just follow you in secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're pulling this stunt again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "You've used this threat once, and that's enough! The reason I'm taking Kendra is that she's the only one who can help me find the Ghost Ship. Taking you would just distract me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I absolutely won't take you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about it! But don't worry, I'll make sure you get a chance for revenge. I'll capture a couple of them alive and hand them over to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sternly pulled two battle robots from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two battle robots stood guard at Yulissa's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep an eye on her for me, and don't let her leave the room until I return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After commanding the robots, Osborne turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face was filled with anxiety. She tried to follow, but the two cold robots blocked her way.</span></p><div class="pagination">
