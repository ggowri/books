  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "I'm waiting for you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're not afraid to die, you can come to me for vengeance anytime. Now, please step aside; I'm going to claim my spoils."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having said this, Osborne made his way towards the Volt Hammer, which was not too far away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's fists were clenched in pure fury, but he ultimately held his silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's victory over Cuthbert meant he would receive a divine artifact and a hefty sum of 500 billion in wealth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This divine artifact was none other than the Volt Hammer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Osborne reached the Volt Hammer, he grasped its handle. Despite its massive size, the hammer felt as light as a feather in his hands.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, a surge of the potent electrical current burst forth from the Volt Hammer, crackling noisily, causing Osborne's hand to sting and forcing a grunt from him. His face turned pale as he nearly dropped the hammer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression became serious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The electrical power from the Volt Hammer was as formidable as being struck by Cuthbert himself, and Osborne was injured lightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly opened up his Dimensional Space and stored the Volt Hammer within.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought to himself, "So that's why the Williamson family offered the Volt Hammer as a prize; such an exceptional divine artifact would be treasured by any superpower.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, not everyone can wield it. A regular Class AAA trying to use it would likely injure themselves before taking down their opponent."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Volt Hammer had its drawbacks, it was indeed a divine artifact, a powerful one at that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thunder Power was Osborne's main power, and with mastery over the Thunder Realm, his strength would only grow stronger with the addition of the Volt Hammer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned to the Williamson family and said, "When will you be giving me the 500 billion reward?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces were gloomy with anger. Each of them wanted to devour Osborne alive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They felt a mix of envy and jealousy as they watched Osborne take the Volt Hammer and then demand the reward, despite it being the rules of the ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But a family elder of the Williamson family replied icily, "Rest assured, we won't default on the 500 billion. It's just a matter of time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can wait here for three days. The full amount will be paid out on time."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned at the proposal. "Three days to wait? The Williamson family, a Divine Family and the royal family of Tethynia, yet you haven't prepared the 500 billion beforehand for your own Honor Quest Ceremony?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sensed the deliberate delay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "They've definitely prepared the reward but don't want to hand it over yet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's the Williamson family planning to do within these three days?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They're probably looking to eliminate me. If I'm dead, they won't have to pay the reward, and they could even reclaim the Volt Hammer."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne scoffed, saying, "There's no need for such trouble. I'll leave you a foreign account; just deposit the money there. I'm sure with your reputation, you wouldn't stoop to such a low level."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, the Williamson family members gave him a cold stare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder gritted his teeth and agreed, "Alright, no problem. The money will be transferred within three days."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne left them after giving them the account details.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony was over, and everyone was preparing to leave, casting envious and jealous glances at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfazed, Osborne ignored them and quickly made his way back to the courtyard.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression was grave as he said, "We need to get out of here quickly! I've humiliated Cuthbert, and the Williamson family won't let that slide. They'll definitely try to retaliate and make sure I stay here in Tethynia. And then there's the Eityreia Organization&mdash;once we're out of the Williamson family's territory, they'll start targeting us for assassination. The longer we wait, the more prepared they'll be, and the more dangerous it'll get."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's face darkened, reflecting her concern. "How are we supposed to leave? This is Tethynia, the Williamson family's turf. If they're determined to stop us, we won't be able to get out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We should have brought a Class S Supreme Overlord from the family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face tightened with resolve. "I'll get you out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Williamson family's real target is me, so I'll use interdimensional travel to send you thirty miles off the coast. You can make your way back to Rosmandi by sea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The vast ocean is a gamble. The Williamson family might not be able to track you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll draw their attention away from you. That's all I can do. Whether you make it back to Rosmandi safely depends on your luck."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's face hardened with worry. "You're planning to lure the Williamson family's forces away? No, that's too dangerous. You should come with us!"</p><div class="pagination">
