  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a cold snort and began his move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gripped his energy pistol tightly and advanced toward the enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was glad he had taken the energy pistol from his Dimensional Space before leaving the mountains. Otherwise, since he couldn't open the Dimensional Space now, he would have been forced to fight barehanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The energy pistol was crucial to his plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne intended to take down Rodney's men one by one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Earlier, when they were all grouped together, Osborne knew that attacking them head-on would likely get him trapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, they had spread out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne figured that as long as he was cautious and didn't act recklessly, even without his spatial power, he could avoid getting cornered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll start with you guys!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Satan's Eye locked onto a team of five.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The team consisted of five members, three of whom had activated Satan's Eye, scanning the area ahead in hopes of spotting Osborne first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately for them, their Satan's Eye was only at level four.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to Osborne's Satan's Eye, their ability to see through the dense jungle was far inferior. They could only see a few hundred feet ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stopped when he was still a mile away from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's been a while since I used sniper. I almost missed it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's a pity this is just a pistol. Though it's an energy weapon with a range far greater than a typical sniper rifle, something still feels off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it'll have to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After muttering to himself, Osborne raised his gun, aiming at the head of one of the men a mile away. He hesitated for a moment, then adjusted his aim to the man's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remembered that the Branch Bloodline Competition rules prohibited intentionally killing opponents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let the hunt begin!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne whispered, injecting a powerful surge of energy into the energy pistol before pulling the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a soft sound, the energy bullet shot out at lightning speed. It traveled much faster than a kinetic bullet, covering the mile distance in the blink of an eye. The trees and thorns along its path were pierced clean through, unable to stop the energy bullet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the bullet reached its target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was completely unprepared. After all, he was surrounded by his companions, and none of them had even seen a glimpse of Osborne, so they hadn't bothered to defend themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no idea he was about to be attacked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With almost no time to react, the energy bullet struck his chest. A bloody hole appeared, and blood began to gush out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He let out a blood-curdling scream and collapsed instantly. Though the wound wasn't fatal, it was severe enough to incapacitate him, rendering him temporarily unable to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His four companions, upon hearing his scream and seeing him fall, finally realized they were under attack. Their faces turned pale with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though they couldn't see the enemy, they quickly went on the defensive, trying to protect themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a few more gunshots, more energy bullets rained down on them, swiftly striking their bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power of the energy pistol was directly linked to Osborne's energy level. Osborne, now at Class A+, had energy that combined martial art aura with level six Devil's Light, making him stronger than most Class AA fighters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These energy bullets were too powerful for them to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unless they had mastered Stretch Soft Force and could use it to protect their bodies, they stood no chance of blocking the energy bullets, even with prior preparation. Their defenses were pierced, and bloody holes appeared on their bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within a second, the four men let out screams of agony. The intense pain brought them to their knees, writhing in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Worried they might still get up, Osborne fired again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few more shots rang out, and the men's legs were hit, blood splattering everywhere. Unless they possessed Osborne's extraordinary healing ability, they were out of the fight for the rest of the Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all this, Osborne let out a cold chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's five!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then locked onto another team.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This team of five, having heard the screams, was quickly approaching. They assumed their fellows had encountered Osborne and were rushing to assist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were about a mile away from the fallen men and were closing the distance rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't hesitate and fired immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With five more gunshots, energy bullets shot out. Osborne's marksmanship was impeccable, and even though the five were moving quickly, none of the shots missed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, if necessary, Osborne could even curve the bullets mid-flight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, there was no need.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's precise aim ensured that each bullet hit its target, striking their chests and legs. Although he didn't kill them, the injuries were enough to take them out of the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's ten!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression remained calm. He was hidden several miles away, like a cold-blooded hunter, picking off his prey one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fifteen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Twenty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In less than a minute, Osborne had taken out four teams within a few miles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Rodney realized something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through his communication channel, he kept receiving reports of his men being attacked, yet no one had spotted the enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dammit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's face turned ashen. He quickly issued an order. "Everyone, converge on my location immediately!"</p><div class="pagination">
