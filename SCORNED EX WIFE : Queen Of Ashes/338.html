        <div>Alexander&#x27;s face twisted with fury. &quot;Don&#x27;t lecture me about loyalty. You&#x27;re the one who cheated on Camille with her sister. You&#x27;re the one who destroyed her ability to trust anyone.&quot;&quot;And I&#x27;ve spent every day since then trying to make amends for that betrayal. </div>
