  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike he aimed at Raoul had been effortlessly blocked by Anastasia, and her lightning attack not only shattered his sword light but also slammed into him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it didn't breach the defenses of his Supreme Malevolence Shield, it still knocked him back, leaving him looking somewhat disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a bitter pill for Alfred to swallow, especially since Anastasia appeared younger than him and, like him, was at the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred snapped, his irritation palpable, "Who the hell are you?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which family of the Paramount Supreme Clan do you belong to? I've never seen you before! And why are you getting in my way? I demand an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assumed that Osborne, Anastasia, and the others were just like him</span><span>, </span><span>members of the Paramount Supreme Clan, possibly from rival factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Aldrich's expression hardened at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow</span><span> and</span><span> murmur</span><span>ed</span><span> to himself, "What's going on? Why is there a faction from the Paramount Supreme Clan interfering? The Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City has ties to the Paramount Supreme Clan? This could get complicated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's concern was evident; he had mistaken Anastasia, Osborne, and the others for super geniuses from some major faction within the Paramount Supreme Clan. He hadn't even considered that they were part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to step forward to clarify things when Anastasia spoke up, her tone calm yet firm. "You've got it all wrong! We're not from the Paramount Supreme Clan; we're from the Human Community. My name is Vivienne Augustine, and as for who we really are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne was the name of Osborne's mother, and as she spoke, a hint of shyness crossed her face as she glanced at Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce stepped forward, his excitement palpable as he surveyed the crowd. "Listen up, everyone! We are the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all part of the Human Community, not some pathetic Paramount Supreme Clan! Sure, you lot from the Paramount Supreme Clan are technically part of the Human Community, too, but I wouldn't dream of associating with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember my name</span><span>, </span><span>Bryce Clarkson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, the Seven Young Deity Kings will shine across Celestara! You'll all be looking up at us, just like the legendary Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, and you'll tremble in fear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's booming voice echoed like thunder</span><span> and</span><span> le</span><span>ft </span><span>everyone around him momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes widened as they processed his declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're from the Human Community? Not the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock rippled through the crowd. Even Alfred and Aldrich were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clearly hadn't expected this group to be from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the surprise quickly morphed into cold fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred shouted, "What the hell is this Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just lowly humans! You're asking for death by getting in my way! I'll take you down right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfred's divine power surged, and he looked ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan snickered, their eyes filled with disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Osborne and his companions were just lowly humans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't move to intervene. It was clear to them that the seven weren't Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if seven Deity Kings showed up, they wouldn't be able to save the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Alfred alone could handle this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had proven his strength by defeating all 10 Deity Kings from the Mystic Feather Clan without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he fear a few lowly humans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they continued to surround the floating mountain, content to watch the impending confrontation unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's voice dripped with contempt. "You think a bunch of lowly humans like you can save the Mystic Feather Clan? The so-called Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? Ha! I'll wipe you all out today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he fixed his gaze on Anastasia. "You want to go first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia calmly nodded, her resolve unwavering. "No problem! Remember my name</span><span>. </span><span>I'm Vivienne, one of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She emphasized her name once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A soon-to-be-dead person? I have no interest in remembering your name," Alfred sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia met his derision with a steady gaze. "I'm not saying it for you. I'm saying it for the spectators because, in my eyes, you're already a dead man walking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words darkened Alfred's expression, his anger flaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant! You pathetic humans will die today! I was just careless before, but now I'm going to take your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfred finally made his move. He swung his Supreme Malevolence Sword, unleashing a terrifying wave of sword light that surged toward Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how he had defeated the 10 Deity King warriors of the Mystic Feather Clan without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no doubt that this girl would be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!" Alfred shouted, his voice echoing with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia remained calm in the face of the oncoming onslaught. She showed no sign of dodging or defending herself. Instead, she simply raised her hand slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning crackled and danced around her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she unleashed a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar of thunder erupted, and in an instant, Alfred's sword light shattered like glass, leaving him momentarily stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
