  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Deschanel Clan followed Terrence out of their sanctuary, their earlier panic replaced by a surge of pride and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their patriarch and the elders by their side, they felt invincible, ready to face any foe without a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, the Augustine family's recent victories&mdash;killing three of their Transcendent Deity elders and seventeen Superior Deities&mdash;were mere blips on the radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they stood tall with twenty-eight Transcendent Deities, including their formidable patriarch, Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could possibly challenge that kind of power on Blue Planet? No one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from the Deschanel Clan as they stepped into the open, and even Rachel felt a wave of relief wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, beneath that relief flickered a dark resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, her eyes glinting with malice, "Damn the Augustine family! I underestimated you, thinking you were nothing but ants! But you managed to kill three of our Transcendent Deities and forced me to call for the patriarch and the elders to awaken early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, you're going to pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You dare to counterattack us? You think you can wipe us out? Just wait&mdash;I'll personally take you all down and unleash my fury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought fueling her, Rachel hurried to join the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Terrence's leadership, the Deschanel Clan warriors surged out of the sanctuary and onto the surface of the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and the God of Star were waiting calmly on the water's surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally decided to show up?" Osborne said, his tone as cool as the sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already seen Terrence and the others through Satan's Eye, assessing their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-nine Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a jolt of shock at the sight. While he had anticipated the Deschanel Clan's might, seeing them all together was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, he had used his spatial power to send the Augustine family gods away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle that lay ahead was one they could not join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Terrence appeared not far from Osborne, flanked by the elite warriors of the Deschanel Clan, their gazes icy and fixed on Osborne and the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star's expression turned to one of disbelief at the sight of the twenty-nine Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..." she began, her voice taut with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to warn him to flee, but Osborne merely smiled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Star, there's no need to panic! I have everything under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star stared at him in astonishment. "The Deschanel Clan has twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can he say he's got it all figured out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he foresee this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I had known they would have this many, I would have advised Osborne to forget about revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can we fight against that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Divine Shadow, Osborne, and me, we're only three against twenty-nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We wouldn't even be able to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she looked at Osborne, who remained composed and unflappable, a thought crossed her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Osborne really did foresee this situation and has a plan? But how could that be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is Ms. Night coming to help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she shows up, we might stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, God of Star felt a little more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Terrence let out a cold snort, his brow furrowing as he glared at Osborne and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned sharply to Rachel, his voice laced with irritation. "Rachel, care to explain? You called us all awake for just these two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel stood there, bewildered, struggling to find the words to justify her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says it's just the two of us? There's also me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shadow suddenly materialized beside Osborne, transforming into a young woman in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glare aimed at Terrence, she declared, "Terrence, I've come for revenge! You injured me and forcibly took Sublime Saintess from me years ago. Now, it's time for you to pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence raised an eyebrow, surprise flitting across his face as he regarded Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto his face. "So it's you! I didn't expect you to still be alive and awake. But really, do you think you can take revenge on me? Back then, we were both Deity Overlords, and you couldn't match my strength. Now that we're both Transcendent Deities, you're still no match for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's eyes blazed with anger. "Let's put that to the test!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scoffed, his disdain palpable, "Test? You think you're worthy? With just the three of you, I can't even be bothered to lift a finger! We have twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors here. Just sending out a handful would be enough to wipe you out! What makes you think you can challenge me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrogance was unmistakable, and Divine Shadow felt a surge of frustration, unable to counter his taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was right; on the surface, they only had three Transcendent Deities, while the Deschanel Clan boasted twenty-nine. Terrence didn't even need to get involved&mdash;he could let his clan handle it and still come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a huff of indignation, Divine Shadow turned to Osborne. "You better pull out your trump card, kid! Don't even think about saying you don't have one. If you don't, we might as well just accept our fate and die here together!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
