  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenneth's words sparked a glimmer of excitement in everyone's eyes, their breaths quickening with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the people present lacked powerful backgrounds; otherwise, they wouldn't have been sent to support the perilous mission at Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many had never even laid eyes on mid-grade Essence Crystals, relying solely on the meager military stipend from the Wild Flame Army to fund their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Kenneth was telling them that they might find a Celestial Crystal atop Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was a Celestial Crystal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a source of energy far superior to even top-grade or Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that a single Celestial Crystal contained the energy equivalent to 100 million low-grade Essence Crystals, and it was far more refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one piece could propel any practitioner to at least the Deity Overlord realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystals had a unique effect that no other Essence Crystal possessed. They could enhance one's talent and break through bottlenecks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those stuck at a plateau for years, feeling like their potential had been drained, obtaining a Celestial Crystal could easily shatter those barriers and elevate their abilities to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Celestial Crystals were legendary treasures, priceless and elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone among them who managed to secure one from Divine Peak Nine would have their fate transformed, rising to become something greater than they ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And aside from Celestial Crystals, Divine Peak Nine also held Miracle Elixirs that could elevate one's realm and Ultimate divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just acquiring any one of these items could drastically change their destinies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's breaths turned </span><span>shallow,</span><span> their eyes gleaming with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne's heart raced at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimate divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his own collection of treasures, he felt powerless against the allure of these items, and Kenneth's words only fueled his excitement about Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenneth, noticing the eager expressions around him, couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you all temper your enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To put it bluntly, if these treasures were so easily obtainable, would they even be </span><span>within your reach? Do you think the Paramount Supreme Clan doesn't want them? Or that the geniuses from the Upper Races don't have their eyes on these prizes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They know full well that there are countless treasures atop the divine peaks, yet they hesitate to venture here. Why? Because Divine Peak Nine is incredibly dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenneth pointed at his scarred face. "Do you see this? I can honestly tell you that to this day, I have no idea how my face ended up like this! I never even set foot on Divine Peak Nine. I was just on the outskirts when I suddenly passed out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I came to, I was left looking like this! Even my foundation got mysteriously damaged, and I've been stuck ever since, unable to advance my cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Kenneth, was ruined by this hellish place called Divine Peak Nine! If it weren't for my greed for the treasures here, if I hadn't been so arrogant to take this risk, I would at least be at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord by now, maybe even a Deity King warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his face contorted with anguish, the long, centipede-like scar rippling as if it were alive, sending a chill through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> if you don't want to end up like me, then stay put in the base! If you must act, stick with the main group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even then, it's still dangerous... Otherwise, nearly half of the previous army of 400 thousand wouldn't have fallen! At least you'll be safer moving with the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I have to say! Don't let your greed ruin your lives! Divine Peak Nine... it's not a divine peak; it's a bottomless abyss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kenneth turned on his heel and left, leaving an eerie silence in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd remained frozen, the weight of his warnings settling heavily upon them. No one spoke; they just stared into space, their faces pale and troubled long after Kenneth had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Athena's room, she stood before a one-way mirror, watching the gathering crowd on the deck, observing Kenneth as he walked away, and then her eyes narrowed at Osborne, who was mingling among the people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold fury flickered in her gaze. "Finally, we've reached the base of Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you bastard, you've turned Calvin into a waste of space, and I'm going to make you pay for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait for the day you die in misery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered under her breath, then pivoted to face Calvin, who sat slumped on the couch, looking dejected and hopeless. A wave of anger welled up in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough with the gloom and doom! Just because I can't cure your divine power essence doesn't mean it can't be restored!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Calvin jolted upright, his eyes wide with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? My divine power essence can still be restored?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena nodded. "In normal circumstances, it would be impossible&mdash;unless the Goddess of Life were to revive you! But here, at Divine Peak Nine, there are Miracle Elixirs capable of healing any ailment..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
