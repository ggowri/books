  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, Agatha noticed the black Sacred Power around her rapidly dissipating, and even the Dark Phoenix Wings on her back vanished instantly. "What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was shocked, completely unable to understand the situation. She felt as if her body was being controlled by Osborne. To be precise, it was controlled by Osborne using the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she couldn't move at all, only watching as Osborne's other hand held her in his arms, forming a sharp arrow aimed at her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You lost," Osborne's voice sounded in Agatha's ear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she was held tightly in Osborne's arms, their bodies pressed completely together. Agatha could even feel Osborne's warm breath brushing against her earlobe, making her feel itchy and tingly all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Agatha's face turned bright red as she tried to break free from Osborne's embrace. But she hadn't admitted defeat yet&mdash;how could Osborne possibly let her go?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Agatha </span><span>struggled,</span><span> the tighter Osborne held her. The friction between their bodies made Agatha feel her body becoming softer, leaving her too afraid to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me go," Agatha said, her face flushed bright red. In her entire life, she had never had close contact with the opposite sex, let alone been held tightly in a man's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she could not only hear her own wildly pounding heartbeat but also Osborne's strong, steady heartbeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t notice Agatha&rsquo;s unease. He held her tightly in his arms and smiled, saying, &ldquo;I can let you go, but you have to admit defeat first.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your strength is too great, and it's hard for me to find your weakness. If I let you go, I'm not sure I can defeat you again. Admit defeat first, and I'll let you go. Otherwise, I won't let go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha became even more embarrassed. "You're so awful. Is victory the only thing that matters in your mind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very puzzled. "We're in a fight. If I don't care about victory, what should I care about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha became even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she could do nothing about it. Being tightly held by Osborne at this moment made her feel shy. Especially knowing clearly that their fight was being projected onto Frost Peak City and watched by billions of viewers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of the audience seeing her held in Osborne's arms made her even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Alright. I give up. You win. Let me go quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief and quickly let go of Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha turned her head and glared fiercely at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw Agatha's flushed face, realized what had happened, and couldn't help feeling a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly explained, "Sorry. I was too focused on the fight just now, thinking about how to beat you, and didn't think much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's explanation, Agatha couldn't help but snort and frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to get angry, but found she simply couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha could only change the subject. "This time, you win. But don't celebrate too soon, I'm not convinced by this loss. I've just awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline and haven't fully mastered the power of the Dark Phoenix, which is why there were flaws."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, I haven't ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame yet, so I can't be considered a fully matured Dark Phoenix. In the future, I will become stronger, and my power will grow. </span><span>Next time we meet, I will definitely defeat you. You need to grow faster. Otherwise, when I beat you next time, I won't even feel a sense of accomplishment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha finished speaking somewhat defiantly, then glared at Osborne again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did she lose, but she was also held by Osborne. Just thinking about it made her furious. But no matter how angry or unconvinced she was, it couldn't change the outcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Agatha at this moment, Osborne felt as if he were seeing her in a new light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still remembered how Agatha used to be, always looking indifferent, as if everyone owed her millions of Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after getting closer, he realized she didn't seem to be like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's current look was exactly the same as when Anastasia and Zoe were being mischievous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you laughing at?" Agatha said angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne coughed to cover his embarrassment, then changed the subject. "Don't worry. Next time we meet, I'll still defeat you. Dark Phoenix may be strong, but it's not invincible. Those I've defeated once have never surpassed me or beaten me. You won't either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said confidently, "If you're not convinced, then let's battle again in a zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha looked at Osborne in surprise. "Why are you so confident? Unfortunately, we might not have the chance to fight in a zone duel again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why?" Now it was Osborne's turn to be surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that his victory over Agatha this time was partly due to luck, but mostly because Agatha hadn't fully mastered the power of Dark Phoenix or ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also knew that Agatha would definitely be stronger in the zone duel, but he wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is because there are three months of recovery time between the state duel and the zone duel. After three months, his cultivation level would surely reach Ascension Ten, and his elemental essence would also reach the highest Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne still had a hundred Frost-kissed Hearts left to absorb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After fully absorbing them, his physical strength would likely reach the advanced Sacredness Level. In that case, his body's defense would be stronger than an average Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would surge. In that case, the third foundational carrier would definitely fully solidify, and even a fourth foundational carrier might emerge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Osborne would be able to merge the fourth and fifth powers, reaching his true peak strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also wanted to face Agatha again in the zone duel to test his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha said they wouldn't have the chance to fight in the zone duel, leaving Osborne very confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip and finally shook her head. "You don't need to ask about the specifics. In short, we won't meet in the zone duel anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne and continued, "If we're destined, we will meet again. Also, I'll tell you a secret. You have nine drops of my Phoenix Blood in your body. No matter where you go, I can sense you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If something happens to you, I can sense it too. You stole my Phoenix Blood, and this is your karma."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha looked at Osborne smugly, as if she had caught him red-handed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could say anything, Agatha took off her badge and threw it to Osborne. "You won, so the state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion is you. Congratulations. After the state duel ends, leave Frost Peak City as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha gave Osborne a deep look, then turned and left, disappearing quickly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
