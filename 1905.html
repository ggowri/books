  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Anastasia and the others had dispersed, only Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three approached Osborne to congratulate him, their expressions warm with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle as he watched Sebastian and Divine Shadow holding hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found their affection amusing but chose to keep his thoughts to himself, turning his attention to the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flicker of intent, he used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to send a message to Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was well aware of Darren's feelings for God of Star. In fact, Darren had sought his approval before pursuing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Osborne had been supportive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, seeing that Darren had yet to succeed made Osborne a bit anxious for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, God of Star, spending time alone these days? It must be tough for you, watching my grandpa and Grandma Divine Shadow flaunt their love every day," he said with a teasing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star rolled her eyes in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and Divine Shadow exchanged exasperated glances, with Sebastian playfully scolding, "You little rascal, looking for trouble? You dare to tease your grandpa like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed heartily. "Come on, Grandpa, it's not all bad! I actually hope you two have a few more kids! Hope Haven could use a little more chaos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, both Sebastian and Divine Shadow turned bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, God of Star chimed in with a grin, "I heard your grandpa and Divine Shadow were even discussing having another one! You might just end up with an uncle soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in delight. "That would be amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sighed in resignation, saying, "Enough of this! Divine Shadow, let's head back to our training!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star smirked. "Oh, you mean back to making babies? Just keep it down. There are plenty of kids around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two adults were left speechless, but just then, Darren finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing him, God of Star instinctively turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian and Divine Shadow quickly stepped in front of her, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think you're going, God of Star?" Divine Shadow asked playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star sighed, feeling trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren approached, bowing respectfully to Osborne first. As a reformed member of the Blood Clan, Osborne was always his top priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned his gentle gaze toward the God of Star. "Star, how have you been lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star bit her lip and nodded, but the words seemed to stick in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stood there, looking like a deer caught in headlights, simply grinning at her like a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, realizing that if he didn't intervene, Darren and God of Star would never find a way to connect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Star, I'm guessing your concern is about Darren's Blood Clan background, right? Well, I can sever my ties with him after a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star blinked, taken aback. "Sever your ties with Darren?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already achieved an impressive level of mastery with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, completing eight layers of fusion. This mastery was crucial for managing the Blood Clan transformations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he reached ten layers of fusion, he would essentially become one with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, gaining full control over its powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, he could easily sever the connection with Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even reaching the ninth layer would suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although all the members of Blood Demon were transformed Blood Clan members, they held a different significance for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered them friends and allies rather than mere subjects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, he planned to give Blood Demon members the option to choose whether they wanted to sever their ties with him, allowing them to regain their freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since God of Star is concerned about Darren's Blood Clan status, I can simply restore Darren's freedom," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he mentioned it, Darren couldn't help but panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cut him off. "Darren, hold on! Don't say a word! Transforming you into a Blood Clan member was a last resort. With my strength back then, there was no other way to save you and restore your damaged divine power essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really like God of Star and want to be with her, I'm all in! Restoring your freedom has been on my mind for a while, and I won't let you refuse! Even after you regain your freedom, we'll still be friends and comrades, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm smile, he turned to the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression shifted as she processed his words. She was indeed struggling with Darren's Blood Clan identity, knowing just how much control Osborne had over the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of Darren regaining his freedom changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she had feelings for him, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined glint in her eye, she asked, "Can you really sever the ties and let him be free?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his smile unwavering. "Just give me a little more time, and it'll happen soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star's face brightened. "Alright! The day he regains his freedom, I... I will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, she turned and dashed away, leaving everyone in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her intentions were clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, looking at Darren. "Congratulations, Darren! Just hang tight a bit longer. It won't be long now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stretch, he added, "Now, I need to get back to hunting for that Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
