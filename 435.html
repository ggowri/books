  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of Point Blank Force isn't particularly strong. It's unlikely to cause significant damage to an enemy. However, when facing opponents with exceptionally strong defenses or those wielding defensive ancient magic weapons, it would be very useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can help you break through the enemy's defense. For instance, it's hard for an ordinary person to puncture a plastic water bottle with their finger, but even a child can easily puncture it with a needle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the bottle is punctured, it leaks water. Similarly, once there's a breach in the enemy's defense, we can easily take them down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining this, Isa began to guide Osborne on how to learn Point Blank Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wasn't exaggerating. Mastering Point Blank Force was indeed much more challenging than mastering Spiral Force or Ninefold Tide Crash. It wasn't as simple as just striking with force. It required an extreme level of control over one's own power to concentrate it into a single point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Osborne felt truly challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Isa elegantly lounge on the sofa, casually eating fruit while pointing out the flaws in his technique, he couldn't help but smile wryly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will succeed!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dedicated himself to training in Point Blank Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't spend all his time practicing advanced martial arts techniques. He also set aside ample time to absorb the energy of blood diamonds and enhance his soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel that his soul of powers was nearing the limit of its current level. It wouldn't be long before he could break through and become a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne kept an eye on the developments of the Maritime Auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he had predicted, the Aberrants didn't launch another attack, and the auction proceeded smoothly. On the first day, the Mighty Scepter, the most important auction item, fetched an astonishing price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight and a half billion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Yalynch noble outbid many competitors with a price of eight and a half billion for the Mighty Scepter and immediately left with it by helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fourth day, the Holy Crown was auctioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final price of the Holy Crown exceeded that of the Mighty Scepter, reaching a staggering ten and eight billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two items alone brought Osborne nearly 20 billion in revenue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had anticipated high prices for these two pieces of jewelry, he was still left in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, several other jewels of varying grades were auctioned off at Luna Jewelry, and the total income from this auction would exceed four hundred billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna Jewelry had now risen to become a world-renowned jewelry company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the auction of the Holy Crown, the Maritime Auction concluded successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biggest winners were the Augustine family and Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's family, the Montague family, also gained immense profits, launching their cruise business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne no longer cared about any of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Maritime Auction had been the center of attention in high society for a while. But as it concluded, news that Alexander was about to marry Clarissa and would officially become the head of the Paltrow family at the wedding quickly took over the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Clarissa instantly became the focus of everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was a super genius of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that when he was born, the weather was highly unusual, with thunder rumbling throughout the night. He was born with Thunder Power, making him a once-in-a-century metahuman within the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just twenty-eight years old, he had already become a Class A Power Master, making him the youngest Class A Power Master in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, his breakthrough scene was extremely grand, and he even received the Blessing of Thunder. After that, he got a lightning mark on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some claimed he was the reincarnation of the God of Thunder, while others said he was the son of the God of Thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was widely regarded as the most powerful of the younger generation in Dampston, rivaling even the prodigies of Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was equally remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family, endowed with powerful fate power. It was said that she had three kinds of power, making her abilities formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, she was stunningly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Clarissa had been known as the most beautiful woman in Skyefall. After arriving in Dampston, she quickly earned the title of the most beautiful woman in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her background was also impressive. She hailed from the ancient Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, their wedding quickly became the hottest topic of conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was looking forward to the wedding, and even families from other regions planned to send representatives to the Paltrow family to attend the ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the wedding day approached, Pinchide City grew increasingly lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne continued to train tirelessly in Isa's mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew! I've finally mastered it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took me ten days, but I've finally reached the proficient level of Point Blank Force! Now I can easily pierce through the enemy's defenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cheered, elated by his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had trained intensely during this time, but fortunately, his efforts had paid off. Not only had he mastered Point Blank Force, but he could also now unleash seven waves of the Ninefold Tide Crash. He had been surpassing the mastery level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reaching the ultimate level of nine waves would still require a long journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused his training and walked over to Isa, wrapping his arms around her waist and kissing her passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa did not refuse but still looked at him with a cold look, and her face was full of disgust. After Osborne stopped, she wiped the corner of her mouth forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. You've made decent progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't teach you more advanced martial arts skills for now. It's not good to learn too much at once! With your current strength, you should be able to handle three or five ordinary Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
