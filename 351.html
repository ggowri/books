  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a doctor. I can't save her!" Osborne said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Evelyn looked up at him, her expression frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't stop there. He continued in a cold, detached tone, "You came to me because Ophelia's injuries are too severe for the ship's doctor to handle, isn't </span><span>that</span><span> right? I happen to know there's a top doctor on this ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go find her yourself. If you can convince her to help, maybe Ophelia still has a chance to survive," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I can do for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now get out!" He said, his voice icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave Evelyn Isa's cabin number, then turned and entered the room, locking the door tightly behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn stood frozen outside the door, but soon, she regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with a glimmer of hope. Despite Osborne's cold demeanor, he had ultimately given her a lead, pointing her toward the top doctor on the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Evelyn raced to the seventh deck, heading straight for the doctor's cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his room, Osborne found Yulissa watching him with a strange look in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored her, and he returned to his room with a grim expression. He picked up the blood diamonds, intending to resume his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how long he sat there, he couldn't focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind kept drifting back to over seven years ago, to the first time he met Ophelia. Back then, she was just an innocent girl. She hadn't yet been consumed by her hunger for power and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had always been bold and passionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell in love with Osborne at first sight. She felt Osborne was handsome and confident and then quickly began to pursue him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was initially very averse to her. After all, he was just an orphan at the bottom of society. He couldn't believe that someone like Ophelia, the daughter of a wealthy family, could truly like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assumed she was only toying with his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But over time, he realized that Ophelia genuinely loved him. Despite being a pampered heiress, Ophelia would personally make breakfast for Osborne every morning and bring it to school for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia never used her status to bully others. On the contrary, she often helped classmates who were struggling in difficult situations, winning the affection of many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, although many suitors pursued Ophelia, she rejected them all, focusing entirely on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Osborne's initial aversion to Ophelia faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally agreed to her advances when his sister Anastasia suddenly fell ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the hospital could not diagnose Anastasia's condition and could only try </span><span>to maintain her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The treatment costs were astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne worked tirelessly, scrimping and saving, but the money he earned was never enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't pay, Anastasia could die at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, exhausted, Osborne dragged himself to the hospital with the few hundred dollars he had earned, only to be told that Anastasia's account had already been credited with a million dollars for her medical expenses. A million dollars would cover Anastasia's care for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne at that time, a million dollars was a huge sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned when he heard the news, but he could guess who had paid the bill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one person who could do something like this. He knew it must be Ophelia, the young heiress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Ophelia had asked the hospital to keep it confidential, Osborne quickly discovered the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He confronted Ophelia, telling her he would find a way to repay the money, but Ophelia just gazed into his eyes with tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She told Osborne that she wasn't playing with his emotions, that she genuinely loved him and wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't push Ophelia away but instead took her hand. He accepted her not because she had money and could save his sister's life but because he was truly touched by her sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he could feel that Ophelia really liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia deeply loved him at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next ten years, Ophelia proved her love through her actions. Even though the elders of the Caldwell family opposed their relationship, she remained determined to marry Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She secretly tied the knot with him, all without her family's consent or even their knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the lack of a wedding, Ophelia was willing to become Osborne's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne genuinely loved Ophelia, too. She treated both him and his sister with great kindness. He felt incredibly fortunate to marry someone like Ophelia, given his status as an orphan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything changed once Osborne became a member of the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn often scolded him and targeted him at every turn. Most of the family despised Osborne, frequently humiliating him. But as long as he could help Ophelia, Osborne was willing to endure it. He was even content to remain in her shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But gradually, Ophelia began to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started craving power and wealth, aspiring to become the family's heir. She grew distant from Osborne, even becoming disdainful of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, with Osborne's secret help, Ophelia did indeed become the heir to the Caldwell family. However, after her success, she gave Osborne a divorce agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the agreement, she asked him to give up all their common property.</span></p><div class="pagination">
