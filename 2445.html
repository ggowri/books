  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately stopped in his tracks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash didn&rsquo;t seem to be seriously injured. However, after being knocked away by Magma Devourer, Flash was obviously furious and directly reverted to its true form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash had grown </span><span>slightly </span><span>larger than before, now </span><span>almost</span><span> 6</span><span>00</span><span> feet tall. Yet, compared to Magma Devourer, </span><span>which is</span><span> 3</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>000 </span><span>feet</span><span> </span><span>tall</span><span>,</span><span> Flash still appeared tiny.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fight between them was like a rabbit actively attacking a full-grown tiger, making people feel tense for Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer was also enraged at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ant in its eyes kept provoking it again and again. This reminded it of Gerald and the other judges. Gerald had severely injured it, leaving it furious. Originally, it had no way to vent its anger. But now, it could unleash all its rage on Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer let out a roar and chose to collide head-on with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the massive Magma Devourer collided with Flash, producing a deafening sound. The entire volcanic region shook, and one volcano after another erupted continuously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Flash was sent flying again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, in </span><span>terms of raw </span><span>strength, Flash was no match for Magma Devourer. After all, Magma Devourer was a Silicon-based Lifeform, incredibly tough and possessing terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's cultivation level was inferior to Magma Devourer's. However, in the collision with Magma Devourer, Flash wasn't directly smashed into pieces and even managed to stop Magma Devourer. This was already </span><span>incredible</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the very least, Osborne, Clara, and Leroy were all stunned at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash is actually </span><span>pretty</span><span> powerful!" Clara murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These days, they had been riding on the back of Flash, who had transformed into a horse, almost treating Flash as a real mount.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, watching Flash confront the terrifying Magma Devourer head-on, they were naturally shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, Flash was knocked flying and injured. However, instead of f</span><span>ear</span><span>, Flash became even more excited and ferocious. Without hesitation, Flash charged forward again, colliding with Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a clash of strength and courage!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the purest and bloodiest face-off! At this moment, even Osborne felt a bit excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, this </span><span>kind of combat</span><span> is only suitable for Silicon-based Lifeforms like Magma Devourer or powerful Beast Clan members like Flash. The Human Community's bodies are too fragile. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though my body is already very close to the advanced Sacredness Level, I still wouldn't dare to engage in such direct collisions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One collision could shatter my body completely. In terms of physical talent, the Human Community can't compare to the Beast Clan, let alone Silicon-based Lifeforms," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a bit worried because he noticed Flash's injuries were worsening with each collision. If this continued, Flash would surely be defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Flash's cultivation level is lower than Magma Devourer's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that if they were at the same cultivation level, Flash's body wouldn't be weaker than Magma Devourer's, and might even be stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, use your advantage!" Osborne shouted to Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Flash changed his combat strategy. The previous head-on collisions </span><span>had been</span><span> thrilling to Flash, but he knew this wouldn't defeat Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, at the moment of colliding with Magma Devourer, Flash quickly flapped his wings and nimbly changed direction. Then, Flash </span><span>flipped past</span><span> Magma Devourer's massive body and clawed at it fiercely with his sharp talons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's sharp claws actually tore through Magma Devourer's defenses, leaving several deep claw marks on its side. Lava-like blood gushed out wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Magma Devourer furious. It roared and turned its head, spewing magma toward Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Flash no longer chose to engage in head-on collisions. Using his incredible speed and </span><span>agility</span><span>, Flash easily dodged Magma Devourer's magma. Then, all three of Flash's heads unleashed Dragon's Breath simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Golden, silver, and blue Dragon's Breath instantly engulfed Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer's thick shell was dissolved, melted, and even frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain made Magma Devourer roar madly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Flash charged at Magma Devourer again, leaving deep scars on its body with his claws. Flash even bit into Magma Devourer, tearing off a chunk of flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next second, Flash spat out Magma Devourer's flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A </span><span>Silicon-based Lifeform's flesh was essentially a pile of hard rocks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer let out a roar, growing even angrier. After being repeatedly toyed with and injured by Flash, its already </span><span>dim-witted </span><span>mind was completely consumed by rage. All it wanted now was to tear Flash to pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had forgotten about returning to its nest and began an even crazier fight with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne widen his eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could Flash actually kill Magma Devourer directly? That would make Primordial and me look stupid. We worked so hard to find Magma Devourer's weakness and prepared for a fatal strike. But Flash can</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> actually</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> kill Magma Devourer all by himself?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit </span><span>exasperated</span><span> but also somewhat delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Flash was his pet beast, absolutely obedient to his commands. The stronger Flash was, the stronger Osborne would be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne was too optimistic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash could indeed harm Magma Devourer, making it furious and causing its wounds to multiply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Flash couldn't kill Magma Devourer directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Magma Devourer's defense and vitality were too overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The injuries Flash caused to Magma Devourer were actually healing quickly. Not a single wound was fatal to Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was quite satisfied, thinking, "This is already pretty good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even a warrior like Gerald, at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, couldn't kill Magma Devourer. </span><span>The fact that</span><span> Flash </span><span>could</span><span> </span><span>push it this far</span><span> was already impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Flash and Magma Devourer were at the same cultivation level, Flash could easily end the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense battle had lasted nearly ten minutes. Flash</span><span> was</span><span> </span><span>covered in more and more wounds</span><span>, clearly at a disadvantage. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Flash was obsessed with the fight, showing no fear and absolutely unwilling to back down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Injuries only made Flash more excited, more thrilled, </span><span>making him</span><span> unleash even greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't want Flash to get seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Flash was just a </span><span>newly</span><span> hatched child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne looked at Primordial. "Primordial, it's been ten minutes. </span><span>Are you done</span><span> yet? If you can't</span><span> do it</span><span>, just say so."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" Primordial </span><span>snapped</span><span>, "You have no idea how hard this is. </span><span>Analyzing</span><span> the weak</span><span> points </span><span>of a Silicon-based Lifeform is extremely complex. Do you think it's easy? Only I can figure it out in such a short time. If it were you, you wouldn't get it done in a month."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Then when we get back, teach me this method and let me see if it's really that hard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. But first, let me tell you where the Magma Devourer's weak</span><span> points are</span><span>." With that, Primordial waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a phantom of the Magma Devourer appeared in front of Primordial. Three flickering light spots were located on its chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Here they are</span><span>. </span><span>You take it from here</span><span>," Primordial said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
