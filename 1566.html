  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's anger radiated like a furnace, but Osborne only chuckled, his amusement apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These recruits were a fiery bunch, all right&mdash;whether they were disgruntled veterans or entitled newcomers, they wasted no time hurling insults his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they seemed to miss, however, was that he wasn't just some random soldier. He was their centurion, their commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any other centurion would likely be red-faced and trembling with rage, incapable of managing soldiers like these.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But not Osborne. He remained unfazed, his icy gaze sweeping over the crowd as he addressed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, my appointment as your commander doesn't sit well with you, huh?" he began, his voice cold yet steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's be honest&mdash;you're all too proud to admit it, but deep down, you know you're nothing but deadweight. That's why you're this angry. So, here's the deal. I'm giving you a chance to prove me wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you think I'm unfit to lead, fight me. One by one. A gauntlet match. If any one of you manages to beat me, I'll never give you another order. In fact, I'll follow your commands. You can make me do anything you want&mdash;even wash your feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if not&mdash;if not a single one of you can take me down&mdash;you'll follow my orders without question. Got it? So, what do you say? Are you game?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's challenging gaze swept over the group, daring them to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were like pouring oil on a fire. The veterans and newcomers, who moments ago had been at odds with each other, now found common ground in their fury toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you looking to get yourself killed?" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really think you can take all of us on by yourself? Better get ready to start washing feet, buddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've just hit Celestial Deity level and suddenly think you're invincible? Against us? You're out of your depth, kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You arrogant Human Community fool, you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their shouts overlapped, growing louder and angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne stood calm, a small, knowing smile playing on his lips. "Looks like some of you actually have guts," he said coolly. "Fine, let's do this. But this is an internal matter&mdash;we'll handle it out of sight. No need to embarrass yourselves in front of outsiders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted in mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Embarrassed? Us? Don't worry&mdash;we'll give you the privacy you need to crawl away in shame when we're done with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them, a young man with a cocky smirk, stepped forward. "I know the perfect spot where no one will interrupt us. Follow me&mdash;if you're man enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a slight nod and followed, his demeanor unshaken. The rest of the group trailed behind, their muttering filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back on the training ground, soldiers who had watched the scene unfold whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That new centurion is insane! He's practically walking into a death trap. He put all the troublemakers under his command and now this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, what was he thinking? Those troublemakers don't care about their futures, and half of them are prodigies from major clans. They won't follow anyone, let alone him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Facing all of them in a gauntlet match? He's as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bet by tomorrow, he'll be crawling out of here with a black eye&mdash;or not at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Bruno hurried into Guy's office, recounting the situation breathlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A gauntlet match?" Guy murmured, leaning back in his chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Osborne might be more formidable than I thought. The fact that he even suggested a gauntlet shows he's confident. He's definitely no ordinary Celestial Deity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's eyes widened in disbelief. "Uncle Guy, you really think he stands a chance? There's no way! Those 110 troublemakers include over a dozen at Celestial Deity level! The newcomers may not have reached that rank yet, but they're all geniuses from top clans, capable of challenging stronger opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even I, as a late-stage Celestial Deity, wouldn't last in a attrition warfare against them! Osborne has zero chance of pulling this off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy chuckled, his expression turning dark. "Whether he wins or loses doesn't matter to us. Either way, he's a dead man walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tonight, I'll finalize the ambush. Tomorrow, we execute the plan. All you need to do is get him to the ambush point. After that, I'll handle everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how strong he is, he won't be a match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cruel glint flashed in Guy's eyes as Bruno nodded, though he couldn't shake the feeling that Osborne might surprise them yet.</span></p><div class="pagination">
