  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Leroy's Dimensional Bag, countless resources and treasures emerged, piling up layer upon layer in the sky, like a massive dark cloud blocking out the sun.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everyone lost the ability to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked up at the sky, their eyes filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's fake, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone murmured, "Her achievements are at least several times Brenda's, right? How could she have so much? That must be fake, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard that some people with special powers can use their abilities to simulate any object, and we can't tell if it's real or fake. Does Leroy have such a power? Are these things all simulated by her abilities?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or is that just an illusion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more people started talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda's face turned extremely pale. She clenched her fists, staring in disbelief at the countless resources and treasures in the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This isn't real. It can't be! This is just an illusion. I have Golden Dragon Eyes, no illusion can deceive me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, golden light radiated from Brenda's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even though Brenda pushed her Golden Dragon Eyes to the limit, those resources and treasures still floated in the air, neither disappearing nor changing form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, those resources and treasures are real!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda was shocked, her face turning even paler, especially when she saw millions of Ice Beetles, making her feel an urge to cough up blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could there be so many Ice Beetles?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda could use her Golden Dragon Eyes to locate dormant Ice Beetles. Moreover, she possessed the power-infused Legendary Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter, which allowed her to kill Ice Beetles in large numbers. She also united a team of over 800 people to gather Ice Beetles for her to eliminate them more efficiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Brenda only obtained over 300,000 Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She originally thought that over 300,000 Ice Beetles would be enough for her to win the zone duel championship with overwhelming superiority, but now, looking at the over one million Ice Beetle corpses, she was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda began to doubt herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, her eyes lit up, and she shouted, "No! These Ice Beetle corpses aren't right! She's cheating! She's cheating!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's voice instantly drew everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did Leroy cheat?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda said Leroy was cheating. How did she figure it out? But these Ice Beetle corpses are fine; they're indeed real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Brenda in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ian, who was equally shocked, had come to his senses and looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was just stunned too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's achievements were so many that Ian could no longer stay calm. Luckily, everyone was in shock, so no one noticed his reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Ian would have felt very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, hearing Brenda's shout, Ian quickly looked at the Ice Beetles' corpses. He didn't notice anything unusual, so he couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, do you mean Leroy cheated? Is there something wrong with these Ice Beetles' corpses? You should clearly tell us what's wrong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, everyone looked at Brenda expectantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda instantly felt extremely excited, as if she had already found Leroy's weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly said, "General Ian Augustine, there's definitely something wrong with these Ice Beetles! Because they've been dead for a long time. It wasn't Leroy who killed them. If I'm not mistaken, it must have been prepared in advance by her sect elders!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy brought these Ice Beetles to Abyssal Planet from outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, she's cheating!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her results should be declared invalid!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, everyone started clamoring. They carefully examined the corpses of the Ice Beetles. With Brenda's reminder, they immediately noticed it too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the Ice Beetles weren't freshly dead but had been dead for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, even louder commotion erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So Leroy cheated! I knew she couldn't have achieved so much! With her abilities, how could she have so many accomplishments?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, Brenda spotted the flaw!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, her results will be canceled! Those Ice Beetles used for cheating might all be confiscated by General Ian Augustine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, Leroy is getting what she deserves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian's eyes lit up. With Brenda's hint, he easily noticed that most of the Ice Beetles had indeed been dead for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes instantly filled with cunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy, do you have anything to explain? Did you bring these Ice Beetle corpses from outside to Abyssal Planet? Tell me. If you dare to lie to me, don&rsquo;t blame me for being ruthless! I can guarantee no one will protect you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian stared coldly at Leroy, making her feel immense pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's face quickly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Ian's oppressive presence, she felt like a small boat in a raging storm, ready to capsize in the vast ocean at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Leroy was about to explain something, she found herself unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian sneered and said, "Not speaking? I'll take that as an admission! How dare you claim resources brought from the outside as your own achievements? If you cheated in the zone duel, you'll never be forgiven!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I&rsquo;m canceling your results! Also, everything you have will be confiscated! Do you have anything else to say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't speak, I'll take it as your agreement!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian looked at Leroy, his eyes radiating even greater pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy felt extremely anxious and furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does staying silent mean I admit and agree?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Do I not want to speak?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In fact, I can't speak!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's terrifying pressure made Leroy unable to speak. He was definitely doing it on purpose because he wanted to obtain her resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Ian didn't give her a chance to explain or even speak. He wanted to forcibly take her things, which would ultimately end up belonging to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy felt extremely angry and aggrieved, but she couldn't speak or do anything about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Ian gave a faint smile and eagerly said, "Leroy, since you still refuse to speak, I'll take it as your agreement. Considering it's your first time cheating, I won't make things difficult for you. I'll just cancel your results, confiscate your belongings, and impose a penalty on you...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was speaking when he suddenly widened his eyes. At this moment, a tall and upright man suddenly stepped in front of Leroy and stared directly into Ian's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Ian lost control over Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His pressure could no longer suppress Leroy, so Leroy broke free from control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Leroy shouted, "I have something to say!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't admit I cheated! And I won't accept the punishment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy felt very angry, and she no longer cared about Ian's identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shouted angrily, "You're so shameless! You used pressure to suppress my body, not letting me explain. Are you a robber? Do you want to steal my things?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shame on you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
