  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Prophet Alliance quickly departed to seek out the Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne began his preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although having the Prophet Alliance and Lord League join forces with the Augustine family to face the combined might of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization would be ideal, Osborne was determined to defeat the allied forces even without them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never placed his hopes fully on these alliances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing the formidable strength of the enemy forces, Osborne was aware that he couldn't be overly confident, especially when it came to ensuring the safety of his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just three days to prepare, he had to make every moment count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's priority was to construct a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This microcosm could serve as a refuge for the Augustine family members, who were not strong enough to withstand an attack, keeping them safe from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two critical elements were required to create a Dimensional Microcosm: a Sanctuary Gem and spatial power, specifically Level Six spatial elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne possessed a hundred Sanctuary Gems and had recently advanced his spatial elemental essence to Level Six, which meant he was ready to construct the microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For my first attempt at connecting a Dimensional Microcosm, let's use a standard Sanctuary Gem," Osborne murmured, taking out a gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Building a Dimensional Microcosm wasn't particularly difficult; the real challenge lay in acquiring the rare Sanctuary Gem and advancing spatial elemental essence to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, who met all the necessary conditions, creating the microcosm was mostly about investing some time to make it more habitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne first carved out a Dimensional Space with an area of about three miles in radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was neither too large nor too small compared to typical microcosms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for life to thrive within, he needed to stabilize it; without constant input of his power, the space would collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it lacked essential components like air and resources for sustaining life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first step was to merge the Sanctuary Gem with the Dimensional Space, using it to stabilize the space and form the framework of the microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then began enhancing the Dimensional Microcosm by adding elements of the Augustine family's familiar environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to transport the nine peaks of the Augustine family's territory into the microcosm since the family was already accustomed to living there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a simple task for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, he transferred the Augustine Bastion, along with the mysterious stone atop the fort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stone had the capability to concentrate the world's energies, making the microcosm a superior cultivation site by amplifying the energies within a hundredfold compared to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to integrate the Dimensional Microcosm with the fabric of the real world, allowing it to follow the natural cycles of sunrise and sunset, mirroring the real world's characteristics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two days of labor, Osborne's meticulously crafted Dimensional Microcosm was finally complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strolled within it, feeling the solid ground beneath his feet, observing the Augustine family's nine familiar peaks rising before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overhead, the sun and moon were visible, along with a canopy of stars, rendering the microcosm indistinguishable from the real world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This microcosm extended only three miles in every direction, beyond which an invisible barrier encased it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three miles in radius&mdash;though a bit snug, it will comfortably house the tens of thousands of Augustine family members. It could even accommodate a few hundred thousand of the Draco Armed Services Branch without feeling cramped," Osborne murmured, clearly satisfied with his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a first attempt at creating a Dimensional Microcosm, achieving this level of success was commendable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, I can add more Sanctuary Gems to expand this microcosm. I even possess a particularly precious Sanctuary Gem capable of constructing a microcosm spanning thousands of miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place will be the sanctuary for the Augustine family," Osborne mused as he exited the Dimensional Microcosm through a swirling black vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he murmured, "A black vortex?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents vanished into one such vortex. Could it be that they entered another Dimensional Microcosm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One way or another, once I deal with the Pantheon League and capture those in the know, the truth will come to light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he caught a small, unremarkable stone in his hand&mdash;this was the carrier of the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reflected on where to safely store this vital object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It needed to be in a place of absolute security, ensuring the family's refuge remained intact and hidden from any potential threats.</span></p><div class="pagination">
