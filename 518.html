  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evelynn, do you understand now that there are always people who are better than you? I've been trying to teach you not to be too proud and to remain humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although we are the direct descendants of the first ancient family in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, it does not mean that we are invincible. Many strong people in the world are not afraid of your identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having suffered such a heavy defeat, do you realize you were wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A calm voice came, and Osborne looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man, appearing to be in his early thirties, approached them at a measured pace. His expression was serene, resembling a tranquil lake. It seemed that no matter how dire the situation, he would handle it with unruffled composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was attractive but not particularly tall. With a reserved demeanor, he was neither overbearing nor arrogant. Nonetheless, he exuded an unmistakable air that made it clear he was not someone to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne guessed correctly, he was Evelynn's brother, Owen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 31 years old, he was ranked fourth among the younger generation of the Augustine family in Newport City. His mother was the eldest daughter of another prominent Newport City family. He perfectly inherited the talents of both parents, possessing dual powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had reached level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the age of twenty-one, he had already broken through to become a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he was quite powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Owen, his expression turning serious. He could overlook Evelynn, but Owen was undoubtedly a formidable opponent, even stronger than Chris and Bruce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena had once mentioned that among the younger generation of the Augustine family in Newport City, four people were the most outstanding and most likely to become the heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was the second youngest among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At such a young age, he had already gained a huge reputation in the Augustine family in Newport City, relying on his strength and means. Anyone who dared to underestimate him would die miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, you've been here for a long time, but why didn't you come out to save me?" Evelynn yelled, crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You simply watched him beat me like that. How could you be so cruel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled, "I want you to learn from this experience! Besides, I didn't save you because he didn't intend to kill you from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I don't know why, he did spare your life. Despite the terrible beating you took, you should still be grateful to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She growled, "Owen, he beat me, but you still spoke for him and asked me to thank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are </span><span>you</span><span> my brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt extremely aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was helpless. "Why can't you learn the lesson? With your personality, you will </span><span>cause big trouble sooner or later. Reflect on it when you go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he ignored Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beaming, he said, "Your name is Osborne Augustine, right? I'm sorry. My sister has been taught badly since childhood. Thank you for showing mercy. Please release her first. She is a girl, after all. If you treat her like this, it will hurt her self-esteem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows and let go of Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sized Owen up seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Osborne had a favorable first impression of Owen, who appeared well-educated and polite without being overbearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his status and background, it was rare that he didn't have an arrogant attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he was much more pleasant than Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not sure if it was a disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You should thank me. I am helping you educate her. Fortunately, she provoked me. If it were someone else, she would have died last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen raised his eyebrows, nodded, and replied, "You are right. However, she is my sister, after all. Since she is bullied, as her brother, I cannot just stand by and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I have to fight you. Do you understand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can beat me, this matter will be over, and the Augustine family will not retaliate against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if not, I expect you to apologize to Evelynn and provide her with the divine artifact she desires. That will settle the matter. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen glanced at Osborne with a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, "So, you're here for the divine artifact, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen replied. "Divine artifacts are incredibly rare. Everyone wants to get them, but not everyone can hold onto them. If you can't even defeat me, it will prove that you can't keep the divine artifact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it reasonable for me to take it away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne guffawed, "I was impressed by how you downplayed your thuggish remarks. I thought I was dealing with a reasonable person, but it turns out you are the same as them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen frowned but still smiled, "You can think whatever you want. Anyway, as a brother, it's my duty to avenge my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to avenge her? Are you sure you can make it? Maybe you will be hung up and beaten like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can do it, I have no objection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You seem very confident that you can beat me. Come on! Owen, show me just how formidable one of the four most excellent and most powerful figures of the younger generation in the Augustine family from Newport City really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready for the fight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
