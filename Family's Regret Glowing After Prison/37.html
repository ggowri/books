        <h1>Chapter 37 Is It Enough?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought Hubery was ridiculous, and she couldn't help bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery said he was concerned about her, but the real reason he came to her was to question whether she had pushed Bertha downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Hubery asked this question, what he wanted to hear was not Aurora's explanation. In fact, he already had an answer in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told Aurora not to hold onto the past and to move on, but she was clearly not at fault. All the accusations were imposed on her by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Hubery who had made mistakes, yet he didn't realize it and even demanded that she be magnanimous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who did he think he was to do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What right did he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of Aurora's mocking laughter, Hubery's face grew increasingly gloomy. He felt Aurora's laughter was getting more and more ear-piercing, stabbing his eardrums painfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop laughing," Hubery yelled in a low voice, his tone tinged with suppressed anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora kept laughing. She laughed until tears streamed down her face, and her eyes were filled with hatred, as if she wanted to tear Hubery's pretense to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you to stop laughing," Hubery roared in anger, raising his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he covered Aurora's mouth and pressed her hard onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were full of anger. "Why have you become like this? Why can't you just listen to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to struggle, but the strength gap between them made it impossible for her to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery not only covered her mouth but also her nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't breathe smoothly as her face quickly turned flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Hubery didn't notice her pain, or he simply didn't care. He pressed her down forcefully as if in punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt suffocated and dizzy. Just before she was about to suffocate to death, Daisy's voice suddenly rang out. "Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she raised the insulated barrel in her hand and smashed it at Hubery's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was hit and let go of his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Daisy kicked Hubery away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora saw Daisy being kicked away and panicked. "Daisy..." she roared, her voice full of horror and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The insulated barrel smashed heavily on the ground, and most of the scalding fish soup inside splashed onto Daisy. She let out a scream, and her face and arms were immediately scalded bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes instantly filled with rage as she grabbed the apple from the bedside table and slammed it down hard on Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, get out! I never want to see you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You tell me to get out? What right do you have to tell me that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget that you've grown up because I've been protecting you all the time. When you were bullied, I fought for you. When you said you wanted to eat fruits, I bought them for you. I've done so much for you, but what have you done for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, when you were beaten and scolded in the orphanage, why didn't you tell me to get out?" With that, Hubery walked towards Aurora again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was so enraged that her whole body was shaking. She grabbed a fruit knife from the fruit basket and waved it randomly at Hubery, forcing him not to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stared intently at the fruit knife in Aurora's hand. "Aurora, are you insane? Do you seriously want to hurt me with that knife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'm insane! You've driven me crazy!" Aurora's hand was shaking violently. She waved the knife rapidly in the air, her eyes red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time Aurora spent in the orphanage was the best memory of her childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Hubery had sent Aurora to prison, she still couldn't completely hate him, all because he had wholeheartedly protected her when she was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought that her five-year prison term was enough to pay off his fifteen-year care for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a rift between them that could no longer be repaired. Aurora just wanted to stay away from him to maintain the last bit of dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hubery kept forcing Aurora, pestering her relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery insisted on forcing Aurora not to care, insisting on making her choose to forgive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want me to do so that you'll let me go?" Aurora shouted hysterically, waving the knife in her hand even more wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trusted you so much in the orphanage. I thought you were my only reliance in this world. You said you wouldn't let anyone bully me, that you would become a lawyer and send all those who bullied me to prison. But what did you do? Did you do what you promised me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care that you broke your promise, nor do I care that you sent me to prison to take the blame for Bertha. But why won't you let me go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was tortured in the dark prison for five years. Isn't that enough to offset your fifteen-year care for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll pay you back. I'm gonna pay it all back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes were filled with determination. She slowly turned the tip of the knife towards herself and stabbed it into her shoulder without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skin on her shoulder was instantly cut open by the sharp blade, and blood gushed out like a spring. The bright red blood, like a blooming flower, slowly slid down her arm and stained the bedsheet a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aurora looked extremely calm, as if she couldn't feel the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora was in prison, she had suffered much more serious injuries than this. She was already used to enduring all kinds of harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't even frown. She just stared intently at Hubery, her lips trembling slightly as she said, "Is it enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery had already been shocked by Aurora's actions. His face was pale. Looking at the blood constantly gushing from Aurora's shoulder, the glaring red color made him feel miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it not enough?" Aurora's voice was frighteningly calm, as if she was talking about something that had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Aurora tightened her grip on the knife handle and pulled the knife out forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora pulled out the knife, more blood splashed out, and a few drops landed on her face. The blood mixed with something on her cheeks that she didn't know if it were sweat or tears, and she looked distressed and determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stabbed the knife into her shoulder again without hesitation, her eyes filled with endless madness and exhaustion. "Is it enough this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... You're so crazy..." Hubery's voice became hoarse and dry. He just felt that Aurora was so strange, so strange that it scared him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't answer, but showed her determination through actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out the knife and stabbed it into her shoulder again, one stab after another. She didn't hesitate and didn't pause for even a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stabbed herself ten times in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time she stabbed into her shoulder, her body trembled slightly, but the determination in her eyes never changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, her shoulder was a bloody mess. The whole ward was filled with the smell of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy could no longer care about the burns on her body. She rushed over worriedly. "Ms. Elvador, stop now." Daisy hugged Aurora tightly and glared at Hubery, her eyes full of hatred. "Why don't you get out? Do you want to kill Ms. Elvador?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with Daisy's excitement, Aurora looked at Hubery with extremely indifferent eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does five years in prison plus the ten stabs I gave myself just now make up for your fifteen-year care for me in the orphanage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery had already been so shocked by Aurora's determination that his heart seemed to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"No, this isn't right. It shouldn't be like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery had come here just to care about her, but why did it end up like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was the girl he had protected and cared for for more than ten years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Hubery didn't speak, Aurora threw the fruit knife at his feet. "Mr. Winston, if you're still not satisfied, pick up the knife. I'll let you stab me as you like until you're satisfied."</span></p></div>
