        <h1>Chapter 125 Joshua's Plot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste collapsed onto the floor, her entire body shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears burst through, flooding down her face uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched her arms forward, her fingers grasping desperately at empty air, as if she could somehow pull Aurora back, who had walked away without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, please! Aurora&mdash;" she screamed at the top of her lungs, her voice growing raspy and shrill from the overwhelming grief and despair. Each desperate cry carried endless pain and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the hospital room remained empty except for her heartbroken wailing. No response came back&mdash;Aurora had already disappeared beyond the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital corridor, Aurora moved forward step by step without the slightest hesitation or doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she reached the corner of the hallway, she suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stopped alongside her, confusion flashing in his eyes as he quietly asked, "What's wrong, Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had positioned herself perfectly&mdash;from where she stood, she had a clear view into Joshua's hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She narrowed her eyes slightly, a sharp glint flashing through them like a shooting star across the night sky. Then, the corner of her mouth curled into a meaningful smile that mixed mischief with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to guess what Mrs. </span><span>Elvador</span><span> is going to do next?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel thought for a moment before saying, "Probably going to confront Joshua."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a soft laugh. "That's exactly what I'm thinking. Why not see the dramatic showdown? I rarely get out these days&mdash;no way I'm missing this juicy drama."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of surprise crossed Daniel's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd known Aurora for just over a month and had always seen her as this elegant, graceful woman. But now, watching her ruthless revenge tactics against those who'd hurt her, he was getting a whole new perspective on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but marvel to himself how this seemingly delicate woman actually had a core of steel and incredible determination. Anyone who had underestimated her was definitely about to pay a steep price for their mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they predicted, it wasn't long before Celeste burst through Joshua's hospital room door, practically flying in her wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes lit up with undisguised excitement&mdash;like a predator spotting its prey&mdash;and she quickly hurried after Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel stuck to Aurora like glue, following right behind, ready to step in if she needed backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the hospital room, Joshua's face was so dark it looked like rain clouds were hanging over his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just gotten the news from Morgan about </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group's bankruptcy, Barnett being taken away by the police, and Bertha getting arrested for "robbery".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bankruptcy and Barnett's arrest didn't shock him&mdash;he'd been expecting this ever since he'd schemed to short the company's stock and set up Barnett as the fall guy. That part wasn't particularly surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly devastated him was that his beloved daughter, Bertha, had ended up in jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, Aurora!" He </span><span>cursed,</span><span> eyes bloodshot with pure rage. "If my leg wasn't messed up, I'd already be hunting you down for what you've done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was sitting there stewing, racking his brain to spring Bertha from jail, Celeste walked in and caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, though, his eyes lit up with a barely noticeable gleam as a lightbulb went off in his head&mdash;a plan he thought was brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting Bertha out would cost serious cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The embroidery Bertha had trashed was worth 20 million dollars, and they'd have to pay every penny of that back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just covering the damage wouldn't cut it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he knew Julian's methods, he realized that pulling Bertha out of jail would require a hefty sum for greasing palms up and down the chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he added it all up, they were looking at a minimum of 40 to 50 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already moved all his assets into Isabella's accounts earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, they had 50 million dollars, but that money was supposed to be their ticket to living it up abroad&mdash;their passport to luxury. The thought of blowing all cash before they left the country made his skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His greedy eyes locked onto Celeste like a wolf spotting its next meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua could only transfer his personal assets and company holdings. He couldn't touch a single cent from Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste still held a decent chunk of company shares, along with her personal savings and a luxurious mansion in her name from </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family. Raising 50 million dollars would be a breeze for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of letting this opportunity by, he figured he might as well use this whole Bertha situation to squeeze every last drop of value out of Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could kill two birds with one stone&mdash;get Bertha out of jail and make Celeste suffer and pay a hefty price for everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts drifted to his own situation. Here he was, a proud, accomplished man with a degree from </span><span>Orley</span><span> University of Technology&mdash;basically a genius with talents coming out of his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have dominated the </span><span>Orley</span><span> business scene, crushed it professionally, and really made something of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, that stubborn old geezer had forced him to marry into their family, turning him into the husband everyone whispered about and looked down on behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That humiliation stuck in his throat like a fish bone he couldn't cough up&mdash;something he'd never get over no matter how long he lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Celeste had actually loved him, she would've married him with Jerome Group as her gift, letting him walk in with his head held high. But no, she made him marry into her family with nothing, swallowing his pride daily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been smart enough to take out that stubborn old man early on, he probably would've spent his life with his head down, getting stomped on by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resentment blazed through him like wildfire, completely out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these years, he'd treated Celeste like a queen, giving her everything she could possibly want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now his precious daughter was behind bars, and it was finally Celeste's turn to pay him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he instantly switched to a pained, helpless expression. His facial muscles twitched slightly as he put on an act of complete heartbreak and turned to Celeste with a pitiful look. "Babe, thank God you're finally here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried just the right amount of weariness and sorrow. Back in the day, Celeste would have immediately asked what was wrong&mdash;that was how much she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any time he looked this worried, she'd comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That setup would have given him the perfect opening to drop the news about Bertha's arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Celeste clutched those papers in a death grip while her eyes locked onto him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua froze for a second. He figured she must too </span><span>caught</span><span> up in her own misery over her broken leg to notice his troubled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to skip the whole song and dance routine. With a dramatic sigh, he continued, "Bertha's been arrested. Babe, we absolutely need to get her out of there. She's never faced hardship&mdash;how's she supposed to handle prison? That dark, miserable hellhole would break her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he spoke, he massaged his temples, putting on a show of being completely burnt out and exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste heard this, her eyes instantly turned bloodshot red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bertha couldn't handle it? But Aurora could?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage crashed over her like a tsunami, drowning everything else. "</span><span>What</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s your plan about </span><span>Bertha </span><span>Elvador</span><span>?" she asked, her voice practically dripping icicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua furrowed his brow, suddenly realizing something was seriously off with Celeste.</span><br><span>Why was she using Bertha's full name like that? This bitch breaks her leg and suddenly grows an attitude problem. Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I've squeezed last cent out of you, you'll be completely useless to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being a housewife for 20 years, no house, no savings, a son in prison, and a daughter who hates your guts. Let's see how high and mighty you act then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You'll end up homeless on the streets, begging for scraps. A </span><span>homeless </span><span>woman is a plaything for men anyway. Hah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These poisonous thoughts ran through his mind while his face remained perfectly blank, desperately hiding the ugliness inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The image of Celeste&mdash;once a privileged princess&mdash;reduced to being used and discarded by random men sent a thrill of pleasure through Joshua. His mouth twitched into a smug little smile before he could stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mood lifted, he couldn't care less about Celeste's ice-queen expression anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat. "Honey, we&rsquo;re in trouble. Hawke Group took everything. My assets are frozen, and Bertha&mdash;she needs us. Only you can fix this. You still have those shares, right? The mansion, the bags&hellip; If we sell everything, we can save her. It&rsquo;s the only way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Money comes and goes, but family? That&rsquo;s forever. We can rebuild, but we have to stick together first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with such raw emotion that anyone would think he was genuinely concerned his family. But he couldn't hide the greed and calculation lurking in his eyes, no matter how hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste immediately saw right through Joshua's twisted plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to squeeze every last drop of value from her, back her into a corner, and leave her with absolutely zero options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd still been clueless about everything, she probably would've gone along with his suggestion without thinking twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she knew Joshua had been plotting against her for years. And here he was, trying to use her money to save his love child with his mistress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned bright red with rage. She looked like a mama bear whose cubs had been threatened&mdash;radiating pure danger from every pore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She violently pushed her wheelchair forward, charging straight at Joshua. Without hesitation, she raised her hand and slapped him with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, you absolute bastard!" Celeste screamed, each word practically shredding her throat on the way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Years! Years of lies! You took everything&mdash;my father, my son, my daughter&hellip; even my damn kidney! And now you want me to save your whore&rsquo;s child? Are you insane? I swear, I&rsquo;ll kill you with my own hands!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept screaming while swinging wildly at him with both hands. She looked ready to rip him apart to satisfy the pure hatred burning inside her.</span></p></div>
