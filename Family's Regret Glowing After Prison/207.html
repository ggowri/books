        <h1>Chapter 207 Aurora's Epilogue I</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Mrs. Elvador! Push hard! We can already see the baby's head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the delivery bed, the woman gritted her teeth and followed the doctor's rhythm, her body straining with every push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a piercing wail filled the air&mdash;the baby was finally born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a girl! Congratulations, Mrs. Elvador. You've got yourself a lovely daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman on the bed was completely wiped out. Her hair was in a mess, sticking to her sweaty and pale cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all her exhaustion melted away as she eagerly blurted out, "Bring my baby over! I want to see her right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the doctor and nurses cleaned up the baby, wrapped her in a soft blanket, and brought her to the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked at her daughter's tiny, rosy-cheeked face, a beaming smile lit up her features. "Is this my little girl? Awesome! You're now the precious little princess of the Elvador family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Aurora came to.</span><br><span>The Elvador family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Princess?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she slowly opened her eyes, she was greeted by Celeste's up-close face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite looking a bit disheveled, Celeste was still a stunner, looking like she was in her early twenties&mdash;much younger than Aurora remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I still alive? How come I'm seeing a young Celeste?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mind was in a whirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene before her seemed utterly surreal yet incredibly vivid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic, and through her blurry vision, Aurora could see nurses scurrying around while the machines beeped steadily in the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it hit her&mdash;all of this was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been reborn, and what was more, she'd gone back to the very moment of her own birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her thoughts running wild, Aurora stared blankly at Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in the hospital bed mustered up the strength to sit up and leaned over to plant a gentle kiss on Aurora's tiny face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kiss left Aurora wide-eyed in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste actually kissed me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, during those three miserable years with the Elvador family, she never in a million years thought her mother would show her such love, let alone kiss her or hold her in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in this new life, Aurora realized: she'd been welcomed into the world with love and expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The daughter that a woman once longed for had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As memories of her past life came rushing back, Aurora realized that Celeste had loved her during those ten months of pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with the passage of time and subsequent losses, those feelings had faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in her musings, Aurora was jolted back to reality when a nurse picked her up and carried her out of the delivery room along with Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, her eyes landed on Joshua, the scoundrel who had caused her so much heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was all over Celeste, doting on her like a loving husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have guessed that this very man had callously abandoned their daughter and years later planned to take her kidney?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though those events were in the past and she had taken her revenge, the bitterness still lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as a helpless infant, Aurora could do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the grueling experience of childbirth, Celeste returned to her hospital room and quickly drifted off into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before nodding off, though, she told Joshua, "Keep an eye on the baby, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua readily agreed, putting on a show of enthusiasm as he beamed at Aurora with a fake fatherly smile, acting like she was the center of his world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as Celeste fell asleep, that smile vanished, and his expression turned sinister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, honey? Honey!" He called out to Celeste a few times, but she was out like a light and didn't stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a cold smirk spread across Joshua's face as he turned his eyes to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora neither cried nor threw a tantrum. Instead, she was gazing at Joshua with her big, wide-open eyes, locking eyes with his cold ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like the scumbag Joshua's going to carry out his plan to get rid of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Joshua reached out for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his big hand hung over her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a surge of panic.</span><br><span>What's going on? I thought he was just going to take me away and dump me. Why's he trying to strangle me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt her delicate neck being squeezed, and panic shot through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this the end? I just got reborn, and now I'm going to kick the bucket?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the twinkling of an eye, Joshua loosened his hold and instead hugged her tiny body close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank God he's not trying to off me after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Joshua had dumped her, and here he was doing the same thing all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unlike last time when her heart was broken, this time Aurora was kind of glad to get away from the Elvador family for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as expected, Joshua chucked her on the doorstep of an orphanage, just like he did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept her mouth shut during the whole ride, her big eyes following Joshua's every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving her there, he looked down at her with disgust and sneered, "You little runt, whether you live or die is up to the fates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he walked off without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was out of sight, Aurora broke down in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold of the late-autumn night seeped into her bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she stayed quiet for too long, she might just freeze to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries echoed in the stillness, attracting the attention of the orphanage staff, who soon opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing the abandoned newborn, they quickly scooped her up and took her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Aurora found herself back in the orphanage once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had no memory of what being this small felt like, but in this life, she had the soul of an adult in the body of a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the other kids, she was remarkably obedient and well-behaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the occasional whimper from hunger or a wet diaper, she rarely made a fuss&mdash;she was, without a doubt, the quietest kid in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her demeanor, the caregivers adored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a well-behaved child! I've never seen a baby who's so good&mdash;really, all she does is eat and sleep, not a single bit of trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, but it's almost too good to be normal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely. She looks like a perfectly healthy little girl, so why was she left here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think there's something wrong with her head? For such a beautiful baby to be abandoned..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caregivers crowded around Aurora, sizing her up from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of them spoke up, "She never cries or throws a tantrum. When she's awake, she just gawks with those big eyes. What if she's, you know, a dumbbell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it does seem that way," another one chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if she is, so be it. As long as she keeps her mouth shut, it'll make our lives a whole lot easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora heard them and just rolled her eyes in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew, and a year passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl they'd labeled a "dumbbell" really took everyone by surprise. Not only could she talk clearly and walk steadily, but she also knew all the letters the caregivers had taught her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This discovery sent shockwaves through the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always thought Aurora was a bit slow on the uptake, but turns out she's a real brainiac!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For sure! I've never seen a kid as sharp as her. She's smarter than any kid I've ever come across."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? I taught her some words, and she got them all on the first try. I'd bet she knows at least two thousand words by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, we've got a genius right here in our place! If only her real parents knew, they'd be kicking themselves for dumping her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was perched on her little stool, deeply absorbed in a book.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word the caregivers said rang clearly in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no plans to play dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Aurora was deliberately showing off her skills, dead-set on finding a way out of the orphanage before her fifteenth birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, her dream was to become a teacher and inspire young minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time around, I'm not gonna be a teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adolph's got a point. With my talent, it'd be a total waste not to get into research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can show off how much smarter I am than my peers, I'll catch the eye of government bigwigs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The only way I can really protect myself is by becoming an unreachable figure to the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They've got so much clout that there's no place I could hide that they wouldn't sniff me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But if I can get into a research institute and become a top-notch talent that's good for the country, then those Elvador scumbags will think twice before they try to cause me trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Aurora's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, no one's going to lay a finger on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I steer clear of the Elvador family, Lily won't turn into that nutjob she used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've got a goal: to save both myself and Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination in her heart, Aurora hit the books even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a brainy girl like her, the stuff they taught in kindergarten and elementary school was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she was two, she'd sailed through the entire elementary school curriculum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caregivers and staff at the orphanage, the director Hannah Kaur included, gawked at her like they'd just found a pot of gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the tender age of three, Aurora wrapped up three years' worth of middle-school material in just one year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she turned four, she'd mastered all of high-school knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora was five, she was a regular at physics competitions, never failing to take first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of talent didn't just blow the minds of folks at the orphanage; it also caught the eye of government bigwigs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The country was starved for top-notch talent, and a smart little girl like Aurora, who'd mastered high-school stuff at such a young age, was bound to stand out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Competitions were a way to spot the rising stars, and being the youngest contestant definitely put her in the hot seat for some special treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, 18-year-old Aurora took the SAT and landed a spot at Vertar University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, 5-year-old Aurora was gearing up for the SAT again, but this time she had her sights set on the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me university focused on national defense and technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While waiting for the admission results, Aurora still called the orphanage home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For five long years, she'd never let herself slack off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was a straight-A student in her previous life, she was just as driven to hit the books in this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after taking the SAT, she found herself with a bit of free time on her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bored out of her mind and antsy, Aurora started wandering around the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was her grown-up vibe that made the other kids keep their distance. And of course, Aurora wasn't exactly itching to get buddy-buddy with anyone either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Hubery's betrayal in her past life had left some deep scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, she steered clear of any overtures from him and hardly ever laid eyes on him, as her whole world revolved around her studies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Aurora was lost in thoughts about Hubery, a basketball came flying out of nowhere and whacked her right on the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the impact sent her crashing to the ground. Her head throbbed painfully, and she saw stars dancing in front of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you there! Fetch my basketball!" A demanding voice rang out from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bit back the pain and turned to see a good-looking boy of around eight or nine, looking at her with a smug smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What rotten luck&mdash;it had to be Hubery of all people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, they'd known each other way before this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Aurora had gone out of her way to avoid him, and now they were facing off for the very first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm talking to you! Are you dumb or what? Get my basketball right now!" Hubery barked, annoyance written all over his face as he stared down at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora eyed Hubery's smirking visage and couldn't help a twinge of disbelief at her past decisions.</span><br><span>How on earth did I befriend Hubery during my days at the orphanage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that the rose-colored glasses are off, he's just a total creep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dusted herself off, picked up the basketball, and started making her way towards him, step by measured step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, with his nose in the air, wore an infuriatingly smug look. "Knew it! A nerd like her doesn't know Jack except hitting the books.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the use of all that studying when you gotta do what I say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at her, so meek and obedient!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped right in front of Hubery and whammed the basketball straight into his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ouch!" he yelped, dropping to the ground, clutching his bruised face as blood gushed from his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Aurora remained as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second's thought, she gave Hubery a hard kick, sending him rolling onto his back, and then landed a couple more quick kicks to his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always been itching to do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora'd dreamed of giving Hubery a good thrashing, but she'd been too feeble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crippled, deaf, and having lost a kidney, she could only take the abuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, despite being just five years old, she was in the pink of health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was as good as gold and excelled in her studies. Hannah held her in high regard and made sure she had the best of everything, far surpassing what the other kids got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, she stood before him as a healthy, chubby little girl with pudgy hands and arms, strong enough to pummel Hubery without even breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, also just a kid, was sobbing on the ground, blood still oozing as he wailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood to one side, watching him with cold detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Hannah came strolling over, trailed by three others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was a well-dressed man in a sharp black suit, oozing charm and class. The woman beside him wore a form-fitting dress that gave off a warm vibe.
