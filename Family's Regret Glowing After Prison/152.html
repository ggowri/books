        <h1>Chapter 152 Adolph Went Crazy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's words were utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Aurora was the true heiress of the Elvador family, but from the start, his engagement had always been with Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when the engagement was made, the Sherwood family knew Bertha wasn't the biological daughter of the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, they pushed Adolph into it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Bertha was the apple of everyone's eye then, basking in the spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Adolph's parents never saw coming was how vicious Bertha's true nature would turn out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Adolph, only the real Elvador heiress was worthy of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he learned Aurora was the real daughter, his heart decided she was his fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the chilling part was that, despite claiming her as his own in his mind, he never once stood by her side, never offered the support or trust she deserved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only doubt and harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Aurora wrap her arms around Julian's waist, leaning on him with complete trust, Adolph was consumed by jealousy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his madness, he blurted out those absurd words without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, </span><span>Wilson</span><span>, </span><span>Lizeth</span><span>, and Camille were so embarrassed that they wished the floor would swallow them whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, who had been gently comforting Aurora, slowly lifted his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze cut toward Adolph like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smirk appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a smooth motion, he raised his well-defined hand and cradled the back of Aurora's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under everyone's stunned stares, he leaned down without warning and pressed his lips to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been lost in her insecurities, quietly grieving over the thought of never being with Julian forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden kiss froze her in place, her mind blank, unable to process it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's kiss was fierce and commanding, paying no mind to the crowd watching. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips moved against hers, lingering and claiming, while his eyes stayed locked on Adolph, brimming with provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was saying, "Aurora is mine. You don't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph met that challenging stare, his heart pounding uncontrollably. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you bastard! I told you not to touch Aurora!" he shouted, charging forward with a raised fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could reach Julian, his father intercepted him with a swift grab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Wilson slapped him across the face and roared, "You idiot! Haven't you humiliated us enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph clenched his fists, tears welling in his eyes as he yelled in grievance, "Dad, he is stealing my woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your woman?" Wilson snapped through gritted teeth. "Aurora accepted Mr. Hawke's proposal. She's his fianc&eacute;e now. As for your woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, his face flushed with embarrassment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hated to admit it, the one engaged to Adolph was Bertha, that venomous woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your woman is Bertha. Stop making a fool of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words hit Adolph like a bucket of cold water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deflated, staring daggers at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Julian pulled a blushing Aurora firmly into his chest, then bent down and scooped her up into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing tall, he strode toward the stairs with steady steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through it all, Aurora didn't spare Adolph a single glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Adolph shouted her name, his voice raw and desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora couldn't hear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora Elvador!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost it completely, lunging forward to chase after her, only to be held back by his father's iron grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian carried Aurora into a room, and the closing door cut off Adolph's view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart plunged into an icy abyss, sinking to rock bottom as every shred of hope shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even dare imagine what might happen between Aurora and Julian alone in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Julian kissed her in front of everyone, what's stopping him from going further out of sight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought drove him mad, his vision darkening with rage. He stumbled, nearly collapsing, but his father caught him just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's pain hit its peak. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sank to the floor, hands covering his face, muttering through choked sobs, "I was wrong, Aurora. Please, look at me again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room echoed with his mournful cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their son break down, Wilson and Lizeth felt their hearts ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could they do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had wronged Aurora too and had no right to face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That she hadn't come after them was already an immense mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson hardened his resolve and bellowed, "Shut up! You have no right to cry. Get up! We're going home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he yanked the sobbing Adolph off the ground and dragged him toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lizeth pushed Camille's wheelchair behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille glanced up at the second floor, whispering in her heart.</span><br><span>Aurora, you have to be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Adolph refused to leave, insisting on staying outside the villa to beg for Aurora's forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, Wilson slapped him a few times across the face before forcibly dragging him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Sherwood Estate, Wilson learned that the Hawke Group had crushed the Sherwood Group to the brink of bankruptcy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it hadn't fully collapsed, their current state was barely a step away from ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson, Lizeth, and Adolph fell into a heavy silence, the atmosphere so oppressive it was hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille, however, let out a cold laugh and said, "This is all karma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she woke up and saw Adolph blindly defend Bertha, she had sensed this day would come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't accidentally saved Aurora's life, Sherwood Group would've followed the Elvador family into ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that her parents and brother could return home intact was only because Aurora had spared them out of consideration for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anyone hearing those ugly secrets would've made the same choice I did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before knowing Bertha's true colors, hadn't she, like Adolph, hurt Aurora over and over for Bertha's sake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone who harmed Aurora deserves this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, lend me your driver," Camille said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill flickered in her eyes. "To the prison. Everyone knows the truth now, but Barnett doesn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As one of the accomplices who framed Aurora, I won't let him live with a clear conscience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wheeled herself out, resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Orley's mental hospital, Celeste thrashed wildly, screaming, "I'm not sick! Let me out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two </span><span>nurses</span><span> exerted great effort to pin her down, while another tied her securely to the bed with a rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror twisted her face as she shouted, trembling, "What are you doing? Do you know who I am? I'm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But halfway through her words, she faltered, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before meeting Joshua, she had been the esteemed eldest daughter of Jerome Group, a name known to all in Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After marrying him, she became Mrs. Elvador.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, that scum, had deceived her all along, and she wanted nothing to do with being his wife anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with no father or husband to rely on, her son in prison, and her daughter filled with hatred toward her, she was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Celeste felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let me go. I'm not sick," she begged through tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor ignored her pleas, replying coldly, "Everyone who comes here says they're fine. If you weren't sick, why would you be sent in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sick," she repeated, over and over, but no one believed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you'll be sick soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a needle pierced her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the drug from the syringe entered her body, Celeste's mind grew hazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair swallowed her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she too tasted what Aurora had endured, being misunderstood, with no one believing her no matter how she explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Aurora feel the same back then? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So helpless and despairing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her eyes fluttered shut, a single tear of regret slid down her cheek.</span></p></div>
