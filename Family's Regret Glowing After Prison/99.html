        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face remained expressionless, but his eyes betrayed a storm of complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart ached like a thousand needles as he watched Aurora being brutally beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he made no move to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He despised Aurora's stubborn nature and her refusal to bend or break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by breaking her spirit and crushing her pride would she finally learn to behave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demands were simple. He just wanted her to be ordinary and obedient, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patiently waited for Aurora to beg for his help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would take her under his protection without hesitation when she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes remained fixed on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The emotion in his gaze was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beg me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just beg me, and I'll help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the pain and humiliation, Aurora slowly raised her head and met Adolph's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood the meaning in his eyes and saw the coldness, anticipation, and barely contained cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her heart turned to ice as her disgust for him reached new depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beg him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would rather die than give him that satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile played on Aurora's swollen face as she stared at Adolph like he was a pathetic clown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph felt his heart clench painfully as if squeezed by an invisible hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to explain, but the words died in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No explanation could suffice, and his eyes betrayed a flash of panic and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feet moved instinctively to help Aurora, but her icy glare stopped him cold, crushing any urge to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He steeled himself and resisted helping her, his face returning to its mask of indifference. However, his clenched fists revealed his inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy mistook Aurora's smile as mockery directed at her, and her rage instantly boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut," Judy snarled. "How dare you laugh at me? If you love seducing men so much, maybe we should strip you naked right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lunged forward, clawing at Aurora's clothes like a woman possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two socialites holding Aurora's arms joined in, their manicured nails leaving bloody scratches on her smooth skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a loud ripping sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's dress tore open with a violent tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's elegant dress was now in tatters from the violent assault by Judy and the other wealthy socialites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was barely covered, with her smooth back and delicate shoulders exposed and covered in scratches and bruises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shredded fabric hung from her limbs, swaying chaotically with her desperate struggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's face was contorted with madness, her eyes bloodshot like a rabid animal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands showed no mercy as she continued to tear at Aurora, each pull unleashing her deep-seated hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut, I'll teach you a lesson today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other socialites joined in, raining down kicks and punches on Aurora without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat her! Beat her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blows rained down on Aurora like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively tried to shield her body with her hands, but the crazed women attacked every exposed inch of her, venting their cruel intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was twisted in agony, tears mixing with blood as they rolled down her cheeks, her tangled hair plastered to her face in a pitiful sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds around her faded, and her vision grew dim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Judy seemed to tire and stepped back, pointing at Aurora, who lay on the ground as she shouted:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her up! Since she loves seducing men so much, let's throw her into the party and let those men get a good look at her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, the socialites' faces showed hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the women hesitantly spoke up, "Mrs. Hawke, this isn't right. It's Madam Hawke's birthday celebration today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's eyes turned cold as she glared at the socialite. "I'll handle this. What are you afraid of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her pressure, the two socialites gritted their teeth. They grabbed the half-conscious Aurora, dragging her toward the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lifeless feet scraped against the floor, leaving trails of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her torn evening gown kept falling apart as they dragged her, leaving her body almost completely exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene unfold with turmoil in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to step in and stop them, but Bertha quickly blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, we can't offend the Hawke family. Isn't that why you came to this party to build connections with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes filled with conflict as he watched Aurora being dragged further away, his guilt and pain reaching unbearable levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bertha's words left him torn. His feet remained frozen in place as he helplessly watched Aurora being led to what would surely be public humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, it's not that I don't want to help you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You brought this on yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You were too stubborn; you provoked Mrs. Hawke and refused to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This humiliation is the price of your difficult personality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept making excuses to justify his inaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he managed to convince himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even started believing that Aurora had tried to seduce someone's husband and deserved this beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon watched in horror as Aurora, barely clothed and covered in bruises, was dragged away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Julian's brutal nature all too well, and his blood ran cold at the thought of how Julian would react seeing Aurora in such a state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's ruthlessness was legendary throughout Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, when a pregnant Judy confronted Julian's mother, the shock caused her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, only five years old at the time, responded by pushing the pregnant Judy down a flight of stairs, causing her to miscarry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not stopping there, he had arranged for doctors to remove Judy's uterus, ensuring she could never have children again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he seemed to have mellowed over the years, showing a gentler face to the world, Simon knew better. The monster was just better hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon couldn't bear to imagine what Julian, a man approaching thirty who had finally found a woman he cared for, would do now that Judy had tortured her like this. Even worse, Simon feared becoming a target of Julian's rage himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled desperately against his captors, ignoring the scratches and bruises covering his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her go if you want to live!" Simon roared as he charged toward Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could get far, Bertha quietly stuck out her leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon couldn't dodge in time and flew forward, crashing hard onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chin slammed against the hard floor, his teeth cutting into his lip as blood immediately began to flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simon lay there, the pain so intense that he lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hit the ballroom floor with a dull thud as they threw her down mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-cheerful chatter of party guests died instantly, replaced by a shocked silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson frowned at the scene and said, "Judy, what the hell are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried a note of reproach, clearly displeased with this spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy laughed it off and said, "What am I doing? I'm catching this homewrecker red-handed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at Aurora with a wild, triumphant look. "Everyone, look at this slut who's been sleeping with my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's face darkened as he quickly covered her mouth, hissing, "It's my mother's 80th birthday, for God's sake! What's wrong with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy yanked his hand away and announced to everyone in the room, "This shameless whore used every dirty trick to seduce my husband and destroy my marriage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice echoed through the ballroom, drawing all eyes to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before anyone could follow her accusing finger, a cold voice cut through the air. "Since when did you become the star of today's celebration?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judy's body stiffened, and as she slowly turned around, she found Julian behind her.</span></p></div>
