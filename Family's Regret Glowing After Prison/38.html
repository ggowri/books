        <h1>Chapter 38 I Agree</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's lips trembled violently. He stared fixedly at the mangled and bloody wound on Aurora's shoulder, the crimson blood seeming like a sharp sword piercing his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His throat felt as if choked by something. He attempted to say something, yet not a single word could escape his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A profound sense of pain engulfed Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had envisioned the moment of reuniting with Aurora countless times. In his mind, despite past setbacks, they would ultimately accompany each other as they used to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now everything had spiraled out of his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was afraid, afraid to face Aurora, who was full of hatred, and afraid to see the endless indifference in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could no longer stand here to face Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, Hubery turned around, his steps unsteady and hurried. He dashed out of the ward as if fleeing for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hubery walked away, Aurora collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut. Her stiff posture gave way, leaving her drained and weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador!" Daisy cried out anxiously, "Doctor, help..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora regained consciousness, she found herself no longer in the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around the room, which was filled with the pastel colors of a princess room. For a moment, she didn't know where she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat up abruptly, which tugged at the wound on her shoulder. She couldn't suppress a muffled groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring the searing pain, she gingerly opened the collar of her blouse and peeked at the wound. It had been tended to, with a white bandage coiled around her shoulder, a faint trace of blood seeping through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora swung her legs out of bed and walked straight ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant she pulled open the door, she realized she had already returned to the Elvador Villa, and the room she was occupying was Barnett's bedroom. She wondered when the room had been decorated in a princess style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora knitted her brows slightly and peered down at the first floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the living room sofa downstairs sat some people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, Barnett, and Bertha were all present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides them was a strikingly handsome and noble man, Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha was the first to notice Aurora standing on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed in delight, "Aurora, you've finally woken up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Aurora's eyes turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Woken up? I was clearly in a coma, and I don't even have the faintest idea how I was discharged from the hospital and ended up back at the Elvador Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, in Bertha's perception, her unconscious state was simply due to her being a sleepyhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora regarded Bertha coldly, a wave of revulsion surging within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha appeared startled and recoiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, tears welled up in her eyes. "Aurora, did I say something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Celeste hurriedly wrapped her arms around Bertha and patted her back to soothe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked up at Aurora, fury was evident on her face, even though she didn't say anything, as if blaming Aurora for bullying Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was way less gentle than Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went off on Aurora, "How dare you glare at your sister? You're in your twenties, but all you do is eat and sleep. We brought you home asleep, and you were still zonked out when we got here. Now it's daytime, and you just woke up. What can you do besides eat and sleep? Why did I end up with such a useless daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua tore into Aurora, not caring that others were around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">"All I do is eat and sleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, ha-ha, how absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He can't even tell that his own daughter was injured and comatose. Does he really think he has the right to humiliate me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had long since seen through their true natures, so Joshua's verbal abuse scarcely fazed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Joshua, whose face was flushed with anger, her own eyes remarkably calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joshua Elvador, have you finished your rant?" Aurora's voice was icy, and she appeared unusually poised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was taken aback by Aurora's sudden retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he was so stunned that he forgot to speak, merely staring at her with wide-eyed astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked silently and was about to retreat to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Joshua yelled at her, "Stop! Come downstairs. I </span><span>need to talk to you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried an air of unassailable authority and his customary commanding tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't want to be anywhere near this hypocritical family for so much as a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disgust welling up from the depths of her soul made her yearn to flee this house of false pretenses immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that the farther she got away, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet</span><span>, with the thought of that ten million dollars dangling before her, she reluctantly caved in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora descended the stairs at a measured pace, walked up to the sofa, and took a seat, her eyes sweeping coldly over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua picked up the coffee cup in front of him, gently blew on the froth floating on the surface, and took a sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not getting any younger. You can't just laze around at home all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mom and I have already discussed it. The Hawke family has power and influence in Joliffe, so you can enjoy your life if you marry there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you have a bad temper, you're still our flesh and blood. As your parents, we're still looking out for you, so naturally we'll prepare a wedding gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words</span><span>, Adolph's grip tightened involuntarily on the coffee cup he held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So this was what Joshua had meant when he said he had a way to collaborate with the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this wasn't what Adolph had hoped to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph felt an indescribable turmoil churning within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his head back and downed the coffee in the cup in one gulp before gradually regaining his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste beamed with joy. She leaned forward, clasped Aurora's hand, and patted it affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, </span><span>we</span><span> will miss you, but you've got to get married sooner or later. While you're still young, you can pick an outstanding man. If you get older, you'll have to choose from the rest of the guys. The Hawke family is mighty, even more so than our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora silently withdrew her hand, hung her head, and remained mute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Mighty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"If the Hawke family is truly that great, would it be my turn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"They're just using my marriage to bolster the standing of the Elvador family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't tolerate Aurora's refusal, and she had no legitimate grounds to turn them down either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stayed silent, but Barnett reacted vehemently. "Dad, Mom, you want to marry Aurora to a rich guy in Joliffe? Why didn't you discuss it with me beforehand? No, I don't agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's complexion darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste immediately tried to smooth things over. "Barnett, don't spout nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not spouting nonsense. The rich guy from the Hawke family is hard to get along with, and he just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Before Barnett could finish his sentence, Joshua cut him off with an angry shout, his eyes full of warnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his fists. "Aurora doesn't even know him. She won't agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett mentioned Aurora, everyone in the room turned their attention to her in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, locked eyes with Barnett, and said without hesitation, "I agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was clear and loud, echoing in the quiet living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, and Bertha's faces were filled with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, however, looked extremely frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, on the other hand, stared intently at Aurora's face, clenching the coffee cup even more tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp crack, Adolph crushed the coffee cup with brute force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glass sliced into Adolph's palm, and his blood dripped onto the white carpet, staining it crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha gasped in shock and exclaimed worriedly, "Adolph, you're hurt. Daisy, hurry up and get the medical kit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, however, seemed impervious to the pain, his eyes fixed piercingly on Aurora.</span></p></div>
