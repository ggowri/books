        <h1>Chapter 238 Epilogue: Aurora 32</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy just stood there, struck dumb, her eyes swimming with confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered why Aurora was so nice to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was also caught off guard. "Aurora, what's got into you all of a sudden?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. "Mom, I'm just head-over-heels for the pasta Daisy makes. I guess I got </span><span>a little carried away</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're that into it, Ms. Barron, I'll </span><span>cook it</span><span> for you anytime," Daisy said</span><span> with </span><span>all sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bobbed her head eagerly, her eyes glued to Daisy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, in a flash, Celeste popped into her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, she'd thought Celeste had come to the Barron Estate to pester her. Now, it dawned on her that she might've misjudged Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Celeste had brought Daisy to her this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no one in the world knew better than Celeste how much Daisy meant to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had finally done something </span><span>right for</span><span> once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She released Daisy and broke into a smile. "Daisy, can you make ravioli? That bowl of pasta didn't quite fill me up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy nodded cheerfully. "You bet, Ms. Barron. Hang tight. I'll go make it right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Daisy skipped off to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora made her way towards the door. Once outside, she scanned the area, but Celeste was nowhere in sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing there, she got lost in her own thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura tiptoed up behind her and laid a gentle hand on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, your birth mother sent Daisy here. She said Daisy's a real sweetheart and would look after you well, and that you'd take a shine to her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, Laura paused for a beat, then added, "I used to have my beef with your birth mother. But over the years, she's turned over a new leaf. Aurora, if you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Laura could finish her sentence, Aurora spun around and wrapped her arms tightly around Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, that's a no-go for me. In my heart, you're the only mom I've ever had, and that's never </span><span>gonna</span><span> change."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so moved that her eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could sense that Celeste was itching to take Aurora away from her. She'd always lived in fear that Aurora would go off with Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing Aurora's words now, she felt a huge weight lifted off her shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew it wasn't </span><span>rational </span><span>to hold onto someone else's daughter, Laura decided to be a bit selfish this one time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's my daughter, and she always will be. I just can't bear to let her go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It must be the good Lord up there who saw how desperate I was for a daughter and sent this gem-like Aurora my way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura took a deep inhale, relishing the sweet scent on her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora was </span><span>little</span><span>, she smelled like warm milk, and Laura couldn't get enough of holding her close.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the milky aroma was long gone, but the faint floral fragrance that lingered on her was just as enchanting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, my precious girl, you're such a doll. You're well-behaved and so darn sensible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No matter how old you get, you'll always be my little angel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Barron, Ms. Barron, </span><span>dinner's</span><span> on the table!" a voice rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you must be starving. Let's dig in," Laura said, tugging Aurora towards the dining area.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora picked up her spoon but then suddenly froze. "Mom, where are Dad and William?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're still at the office. Our company's self-developed holographic game helmet doesn't have a face yet. Your dad and brother are there haggling over the endorsement deal today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unveiling of the holographic helmet had sent shockwaves across the globe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, all the A-list celebrities in </span><span>Peloland</span><span> </span><span>were</span><span> scrambling to land the endorsement deal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming the face of that game helmet was like a one-way ticket to worldwide stardom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded. "Dad and William haven't </span><span>eaten</span><span> yet, have they?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, they've been swamped lately. They're so busy they can't even find a minute to grab a bite."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pressed her lips and turned to Daisy. "Daisy, you got any more ravioli?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, there's some left."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, Daisy. Wrap it up for me. I'll head over to the office and drop off some grub for Dad and my brother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora was always on pins and needles, worried that Barnett would end up with a stomachache from skipping meals. So, she'd try to bring him food whenever she could.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sadly, Barnett never really got it. He never let her set foot in the company, thinking she looked like a hot mess and </span><span>was an embarrassment</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, she had a family that loved her, and there was no doubt she'd </span><span>do anything</span><span> for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Barnett used to get his meals delivered by her. There was no way her dad and brother in this lifetime would be left out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora </span><span>quickly finished the food</span><span>, then snatched up the thermos and jumped on her e-bike.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, watch your step on the road."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over at the Barron Group, Aurora marched in, clutching the thermos tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist stepped in her way. "</span><span>Who are </span><span>you here to see, miss?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora put on her best polite tone. "I'm here to visit Mr. Barron and Mr. William Barron."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but Mr. Barron and Mr. William Barron are up to their necks </span><span>in</span><span> work right now. If you don't have an appointment, miss, you can't go in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora held the thermos aloft. "I'm here to drop off food for my dad and my brother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave Aurora a once-over, and </span><span>all of a sudden</span><span> in shock</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder I thought the girl seemed familiar at first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Aurora's little hint, it all clicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd seen the online reports.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was </span><span>Peloland's</span><span> youngest prodigy scientist, the chairman's daughter and the president's sister.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very reason the Barron Group managed to create those gaming helmets with holographic tech was because of Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist was over the moon with excitement. "You're seriously Ms. Barron?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quickly put a finger </span><span>to</span><span> her lips, shushing her. "So, can I go in now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist clamped her mouth shut and bobbed her head up and down like a yo-yo.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora flashed </span><span>her</span><span> a sweet smile. "Thanks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on</span><span>, Aurora stepped into the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist wasted no time and dialed the president's assistant right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Barron's here at the office, bringing food for Mr. Barron and Mr. William Barron."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant glanced over at the chairman and William, who were right in the middle of an interview. After a split-second of hesitation, he gritted his teeth and walked in. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning in</span><span> close, he murmured in William's ear, "Mr. William Barron, Ms. Barron's here with food for you and Mr. Barron. She's waiting in your office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's usually stone-cold face softened in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot up from his chair so fast that it screeched across the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the celebrities being interviewed stared at this notoriously ice-cold William in utter confusion, wondering what the hell had gotten into him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin frowned at William.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William leaned over and whispered, "Dad, Aurora's here with food. She's in your office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was getting antsy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing in the world could top his beloved daughter in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I knew it! My girl is the kindest and most caring one. Just look at her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's gone out of her way to bring me food </span><span style="font-style: italic;">to</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the office. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">She's never done this before</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't let her wait around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin leaped to his feet as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put the interview on hold," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strode out of the room without so much as a backward glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those left behind exchanged puzzled looks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is going on?" one of them blurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beats me. Seems like something big has happened."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I finally got my chance, and Mr. Barron and Mr. William Barron just left."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the chairman's office, Aurora had just placed the thermos on the table when Benjamin and William burst in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby girl, what a pleasant surprise! What brings you here?" Benjamin exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried you guys hadn't eaten, so I thought I'd drop by with some food," Aurora explained with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was on the verge of tears. "My sweetie is just the most thoughtful. Unlike your brother here, he'd let me starve to the bone before he ever thought of bringing me a bite to eat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William rolled his eyes. "Dad, come on. When </span><span>have</span><span> you ever </span><span>brought</span><span> me lunch? I don't think I've ever seen you holding a lunch box for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>your </span><span>dad. You think I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> be your personal lunch-delivery guy? You're living in a fantasy world," Benjamin retorted, shooting William a dirty look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Aurora, his face lighting up like a Christmas tree. "But if our Aurora's hungry, I'll bring her whatever she wants, whenever she asks."</span></p></div>
