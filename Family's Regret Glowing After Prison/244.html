        <h1>Chapter 244 Epilogue: Aurora XXXVIII</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, that despicable man was exactly</span><span> </span><span>the reason Aurora rejected adoption. </span><span>And b</span><span>ecause she wasn't taken in by a new family, she ended up back with the Elvadors, eating their abuse every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And h</span><span>e left her hanging in court, letting her take the fall for something she didn't do. Five years behind bars because he couldn't speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thanks to Hubery Winston's sorry self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Aurora went full hustle mode&mdash;working her fingers to the bone, entering every competition she could find, throwing every dollar at his law school dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how did he thank her? Used her like a stepping stone, building his fancy career by throwing her under the bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first act as a rising star was to betray her, ensuring she was locked away in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past life</span><span>, Hubery had reveled in years of splendor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lived in a multimillion-dollar penthouse in Orley's bustling heart, cruised in a luxury car worth a fortune, and dressed in </span><span>numerous </span><span>tailor-made suits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his polished exterior to his curated demeanor, he radiated the aura of an elite, every detail crafted by wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, stripped of Aurora's support, Hubery had grown into nothing more than a petty thug, aimless and insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the police led him away in handcuffs, Aurora stopped one of them. "Officer, what's he in for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people wouldn't get an answer, but Aurora was the country's golden child, the state's pride and joy. So the</span><span> officer</span><span> gave it straight, "Public debauchery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's breath hitched, her face flashing with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Public debauchery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, w</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ithout my help, Hubery's no better than a speck of dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, any trace of interest in him vanished. She could tell he was just a worthless figure, forever banished from her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned to </span><span>leave</span><span>, Hubery's voice rang out, desperate and ragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Don't I know you from somewhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora glanced back, her eyes meeting his for a fleeting second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression remained calm, almost indifferent. "Someone of your status didn't deserve to know me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fates had flipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was no longer the renowned Orley lawyer of her past life, just a broke, powerless delinquent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was no longer the scorned, neglected daughter of the Elvador family. She was the adored princess of the Barron family, Julian's fianc&eacute;e, a prodigious genius, and a pioneering scientist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, her many titles formed an impenetrable shield, ensuring no one could dare to harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Aurora slipped into her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vehicle pulled away, Hubery felt a pang of loss, as though something irreplaceable had slipped through his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze clung to the ca</span><span>r</span><span>, a wild urge to chase after it surging within him. But bound by shackles and flanked by officers, he could only stand rooted, watching her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His best years were doomed to waste away behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time raced forward, and ten years passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was now twenty-seven years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd only lived to twenty-three, her body and spirit broken by the Elvador family's cruelty, her life snuffed out by poison to shield Lily from blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, she vowed to never let death claim her so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-seven, Aurora had blossomed into a woman of striking elegance. Her tall, graceful figure and captivating charm turned heads, blending sophistication with an effortless warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past decade, her research had consumed her, leaving little time for visits home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after a major breakthrough in her work, she could finally take a real break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, she was preparing to marry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's wedding was a spectacle, drawing luminaries from the realms of commerce and politics, their presence lending the event an air of grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only blemish was the weather. There was a steady rain that blanketed Putnam that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was fine. The ceremony unfolded within the lavish halls of Celestia Palace, a luxury hotel, where the rain couldn't dim the celebration's brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The venue buzzed with guests, their excitement palpable as the event drew near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly everyone had arrived, filling the space with chatter and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, however, was a bundle of nerves, pacing restlessly as she dialed Lily's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, Aurora's wedding is about to begin! Why aren't you here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm almost there, Mom," Lily answered, her voice tight with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood at a bus stop, her face etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ten years, Aurora's words of encouragement had been her guiding light. Lily had thrown herself into her studies, graduating with top honors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through relentless effort, she'd secured a coveted position at the Science and Technology Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Institute was sprawling, and with Aurora immersed in a different field, their paths seldom crossed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their packed schedules left little room for catching up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, a critical research task had held Lily back, delaying her until the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she'd finished, she'd rushed out, only to be caught in the downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sheltering under the bus stop's awning, she fumbled with her phone to book a ride, her fingers moving with frantic haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes, a sleek black car rolled to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without glancing at the license plate, Lily sprinted through the rain, flung open the passenger door, and slid inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, take me to Celestia Palace," she said, catching her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, who'd just leaned down to grab his phone, looked up to find a stranger in his front seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wore a simple white T-shirt and blue jeans, her hair pulled into a neat ponytail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain had left her bangs and lashes glistening with droplets, and her damp T-shirt hugged her frame, tracing the delicate curves of her figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes lingered, a spark of recognition flickering in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though, on another rainy day, a girl just like her had sat beside him in this very seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared, caught in the strange familiarity of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, noticing the car hadn't budged, shot him an impatient glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was dressed in a tailored black suit, his features sharp and undeniably handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, can you hurry, please?" She pressed. "My friend's getting married at Celestia Palace, and I'll miss the wedding if we don't get moving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan blinked, shaking off the haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only wedding at Celestia Palace today was Julian and Aurora's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could she be a friend of Ms. Barron's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over her again, catching the work ID hanging around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> researcher at the Institute, likely a colleague of Ms. Barron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Her name's</span><span style="font-style: italic;">...</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Lily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name stirred something deep within him, familiar yet elusive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh my, she mistook me for her Uber driver</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of amusement lit his eyes. He raised an eyebrow and turned the key, the engine purring to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his black Maybach glided away, another car pulled up to the bus stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's phone buzzed. She answered, and an irritated voice snapped, "You said you were at the bus stop! Where'd you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm already in a car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You jumped into someone else's ride? Come on, you could've told me! Cancel the order yourself." The driver hung up, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned to Ethan, </span><span>clearly confused</span><span>. "Wait, you're not my Uber driver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's lips curled into a teasing smile. "Do I strike you as one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes darted to the emblem on the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Maybach</span><span style="font-style: italic;">??!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed with embarrassment. She had climbed into the wrong car entirely.</span></p></div>
