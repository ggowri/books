        <h1>Chapter 66 The Precious Daughter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes burned crimson with rage&mdash;this time, her intent to kill Joshua was not just an empty threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror consumed Joshua as his mind flashed back to the last time Aurora had nearly killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, her murderous intent was even stronger, her resolve even more chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pupils dilated with sheer panic, and his legs, heavy as lead, refused to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife was mere inches from plunging into his heart when Celeste, standing beside him, shoved him aside. His body lurched to one side, and instead of his heart, the blade buried itself deep into his shoulder, slicing clean through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodcurdling scream tore from Joshua's throat, echoing through the hospital room as if it could shatter the very walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't even pause&mdash;she yanked the knife free without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no mercy in her eyes, only hatred, dark and endless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she aimed for his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had never felt such gut-wrenching fear. Clutching his bleeding shoulder, he begged, "Aurora, I swear, I finally realize my mistakes. Please&mdash;don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't hear him. Or rather, she didn't care. His desperate pleas meant nothing to her. With unwavering determination, she drove the knife forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three strikes came one after another, each carrying five years' worth of pain, injustice, and fury. Not once did she hesitate, not once did she blink. She had already declared her intentions&mdash;she wanted him dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's body betrayed him, his fear so overwhelming that he lost control of himself. His only thought was escape. He bolted toward the door, caring for nothing else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third stab landed on his backside, making him stumble. But he knew&mdash;if he stopped running, death awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his desperation, he didn't even spare a glance at his wife or Bertha. He just ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joshua disappeared, Aurora slowly turned to Bertha, the bloodlust in her eyes locking onto her next target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire body was drenched in blood, the dark red liquid dripping from her hands, her sleeves, pooling onto the cold hospital floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strands of her hair, damp with sweat and blood, clung to her pale face&mdash;her expression an eerie mix of madness and unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like a demon risen from hell, exuding a terrifying aura that made Bertha's legs turn to jelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha trembled violently, her lips quivering as she tried to form words, to beg for mercy. But terror had stolen her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every step Aurora took, Bertha instinctively retreated, as if distance could save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you good at playing the victim, Bertha?" Aurora's voice was hoarse, but each word was sharp as a blade. "I rotted in prison for five years&mdash;five years of suffering&mdash;while you lived in luxury, basking in everything that should have been mine. But today, you're finally going to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I..." Bertha stammered, her voice trembling beyond control, her wide eyes fixed on the knife glinting in Aurora's bloodied hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned as pale as paper, beads of sweat mingling with the makeup on her face, making her look both pathetic and desperate. "Aurora, please... don't kill me. I... I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression remained unchanged, her voice cold and devoid of warmth. "Wrong? Were you wrong five years ago when you framed me? Were you wrong when you let me rot in prison while you played the innocent victim? Now you want to admit you were wrong? It's too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife rose once again, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, frozen with fear, suddenly snapped back to reality and lunged forward. "Aurora, stop! Murder is a crime&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Aurora's knife plunged straight through his hand, blood spilling between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's agonized scream tore through the air, his handsome face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pulled the knife free with brutal efficiency, her gaze never once leaving Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had reached the height of hysteria. Her survival instincts took over, overriding any remaining rational thought. Without hesitation, she grabbed Celeste&mdash;her own mother&mdash;and shoved her forward as a human shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes widened in sheer disbelief. In her worst nightmares, she never would have imagined that the daughter she loved so much, the daughter she had defended at all costs, would use her as a sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's knife sank deep into Celeste's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Celeste could only stare&mdash;first at the blade, then at Aurora, and then at Bertha, whose horrified expression was tinged with the unmistakable guilt of betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"M-Mom... I didn't mean to... I really didn't mean to..." Bertha sobbed, but even as she cried, she was already turning, bolting out of the room, leaving Celeste to collapse in a pool of her own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears spilled from Celeste's eyes, though it was unclear if it was from the pain of her wound or the heartbreak of Bertha's utter abandonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora released the knife's handle and suddenly threw her head back in laughter. It was a broken, bitter laugh that filled the room, sharp and grating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, aren't you all just the perfect little family?" Aurora sneered, her voice dripping with venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How does it feel to be used as a shield by your precious daughter? Is this what you wanted? Do you still love her now? Do you still think she's better than me? Hahaha&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed so hard that tears welled in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood and tears mixed, tracing a cruel path down her pale face. She looked like she had clawed her way out of a grave, a woman whose spirit had long since been broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jabbed a finger at herself, voice trembling with fury. "I, your real daughter, spent years trying to earn your love. I groveled at your feet, desperate for your approval, and what did I get? You never saw me. No matter what I did, I was always wrong in your eyes, and Bertha? No matter what she did, she was always right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out another cold, bitter laugh. "But look at her now&mdash;when it came down to life or death, she didn't even hesitate to throw you away. I bet that stings, doesn't it? Hahaha&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, slumped on the floor, was writhing in pain, his wounded hand trembling as blood continued to drip, staining the floor beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, meanwhile, was staring at Aurora, her eyes filled with regret. "Aurora..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That one word&mdash;her name, spoken so softly, so tenderly&mdash;struck Aurora like a knife straight to the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter cut off abruptly. She stiffened, eyes burning with fresh, unspoken pain. "Don't you dare say my name," she snarled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears rolled silently down her cheeks, her chest tightening with emotions she wished she could suppress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew. She had crossed a line. She had committed murder. No one was going to let her walk away this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like five years ago, they would throw her into prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That hellhole&mdash;she had survived it once, but she couldn't do it again. She wouldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had tried everything. After being released from prison, she had attempted to escape from her family, desperate to free herself from their control and manipulation. She had fought back, seeking justice for herself. She had tried to make the truth known to the world, to expose the injustice she had suffered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even attempted to kill Joshua and Bertha, but each time, she failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't a monster. She wasn't evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here she was&mdash;alone, broken, covered in blood, while the true villains thrived, living their perfect, enviable lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire existence had become a cruel joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And despite everything, she still couldn't bring herself to kill Barnett or Celeste. Because at some point in her wretched life, they had given her warmth, no matter how fleeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated herself for that weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had ruined everything. Her life was in shambles. There was nothing left for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death, at least, would be an escape. No more pain, no more injustice, no more betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took slow, measured steps toward the window. She climbed up, perching on the ledge, her feet dangling in the air. The wind outside whispered against her skin, playing with her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One step forward, and it would all be over.</span></p></div>
