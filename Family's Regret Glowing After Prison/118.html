        <h1>Chapter 118 Falling into the Trap</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan tilted his head back, the alcohol fogging his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dim light, his cheeks</span><span> flushed</span><span>, with faint </span><span>mark</span><span>s</span><span> left</span><span> </span><span>from his glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tie hung loosely around his neck like a limp snake, and his shirt was open just enough to hint at his muscular build. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each breath, his chest rose and fell slightly, adding an unexpected edge to his usual composed demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, tracing an enticing curve across his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes zeroed in on it, and a wave of inexplicable excitement surged inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something almost magnetic about his long and smooth neck, and she felt her fingers tremble, drawn to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but imagine how it would feel to grip it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand moved of its own accord, inching toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as her fingers were about to brush his skin, Ethan's low, confused voice broke the tension. "Who... who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily couldn't help but smirk in her mind, "Already forgotten me after just one day?</span><span> </span><span>Or are you really this drunk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled a lazy smile from her lips, her fingers curling elegantly away from his neck. Instead, they settled firmly on his jaw, holding him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her back arched slightly, her shirt clinging to the curve of her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, a playful gleam in her eyes as though she were teasing a well-behaved puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't remember me, sir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was too drunk to process anything properly. His vision was blurry, and Lily's words felt distant, almost like they were coming from someone far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irritated, he waved her hand off and tried to get up, his body swaying unsteadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shoes scraped noisily on the floor as he staggered forward, barely managing to stay on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him lose his balance, Lily quickly wrapped her arm around his waist, her fingers digging into his firm abdomen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden grip took her by surprise. His muscles were solid, impossibly firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan let out a soft grunt from the sharp pain, his brow furrowing as he shook his head, trying to clear the haze of alcohol. His mind felt like a chaotic storm, and he couldn't focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get... off me," he mumbled, his voice thick with drunkenness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled, a flicker of amusement in her eyes, before loosening her grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the support, Ethan's body lurched, losing what little balance he had left. He collapsed to the floor with a loud crash, the fall jarring enough to snap him out of his stupor, the fog in his mind beginning to clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood back, her arms crossed, watching with amusement as he struggled on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Ethan turned to look at her, </span><span>he finally got a better look of her face</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teasing smirk that had been playing on her lips vanished in an instant, replaced by a look of genuine concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt down beside him, her voice soft, tinged with worry. "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan reached up, clumsily grabbing for his glasses. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fumbling for a moment, he managed to put them on, his vision slowly sharpening. As he looked at her, the haze started to lift, and he recognized her now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of concern, her gaze fixed on him as if she genuinely cared about his well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes brightened, a triumphant smile tugging at her lips. "Sir, you remember me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned, clearly confused. "How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face flushed, and she quickly dropped her gaze, a little embarrassed. Her voice was soft as she answered, "I... I came to bring you your umbrella."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes finally shifted to the umbrella she was holding, his expression sharpening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her with a calculating gaze, as if trying to figure her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was drunk, sure, but not naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years of being around Julian, he'd seen every kind of woman and every trick in the book. Nothing surprised him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about Lily made him hesitate. A gnawing suspicion crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know I'd be here tonight?" His voice was husky, laced with suspicion, </span><span>his gaze unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, Lily's eyes betrayed a flicker of calculation. This man wasn't as easy to deceive as he looked. He was sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had prepared for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly wiped any trace of calculation from her face, returning to that sweet, innocent look, one that could pass for a harmless college girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't see you this morning, so I thought I'd try my luck at the bar... hoping to run into you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's head was a mess, but as he forced himself to think, a flicker of clarity returned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This morning, he had driven past Orley University of Technology. He'd been so caught up in his fury over the Elvador family that he had completely forgotten his promise to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the memory settled in, his doubts faded away. He nodded thoughtfully. "I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to stand but his legs felt like jelly, and despite a few attempts, he couldn't manage to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily quickly moved to support him. "Let me help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked at her, noticing the determination in her clear eyes as she struggled to support him. A faint smile tugged at his lips. He couldn't help but think she seemed unusually kind and sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, pretending not to notice his smile, exaggerated her struggle to lift him, acting as though it took all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's body was unsteady, almost collapsing against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of him made it clear there was no way he could drive in this condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you drive?"</span><span> He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated for just a moment before replying, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan pulled the car keys from his pocket and handed them to her. "I may need you to take me home tonight. Sorry to trouble you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She accepted the keys, and for a split second, a sly glint flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supporting him, she guided him to the car, carefully getting him into the backseat before shutting the door behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned away, she raised an eyebrow and couldn't help but smile</span><span>. It was</span><span> </span><span>a victorious, almost mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan slumped against the seat, eyes closed, already on the edge of sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mumbled his address in a daze and then, almost immediately, drifted off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily started the car, shifting gears with practiced ease. The car sped out of the parking lot, the night air rushing past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orley sparkled under the darkness, the city alive with neon lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drove straight into the wealthier part of the city, the elite district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they finally reached his home, she helped Ethan to the front door. After unlocking it with his fingerprint, she guided him into the spacious apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they stepped into the living room, Lily's sharp eyes caught sight of the small red light blinking from a security camera in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brow for a brief second, but quickly regained her composure. Her </span><span>hand was still steady as she supported Ethan, guiding him to the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes flicked around the room quickly, scanning every corner. Satisfied that there were no cameras, she allowed herself to relax, her smile deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she</span><span> dropped him onto the soft bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the entire process, Ethan was like a ragdoll, completely limp, showing no resistance as Lily maneuvered him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze drifted around the room, taking in the elegant design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls were painted in a soft, warm beige, and dark wooden furniture added a touch of sophistication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the bed, an abstract painting hung on the wall, the colors vibrant and bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nightstands on either side of the bed were neat, with lamps and a few trinkets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily scanned the room, making sure there was nothing out of place. Once she confirmed the absence of cameras, her gaze sharpened like a predator eyeing its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved gracefully toward the bed, looking down at the sleeping Ethan. A faint smile tugged at her lips as she studied his still form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir?" she called softly, testing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir!" She raised her voice when he didn't respond, but still, there was no reaction. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing remained steady, deep, and peaceful. He was out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gave a cold smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like he was completely out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick, deliberate motion, she tore open her shirt. The buttons popped off with a loud snap and scattered across the bed and floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shirt fell open, revealing the soft outline of her body, only the thin straps of her camisole covering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tousled her hair, letting strands fall across her face, making her appear even more disheveled and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she screamed, sharp and desperate. "Ah! Sir, don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled, as if she had just been through something horrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the scream faded, she hugged herself tightly and, sobbing, bolted out of the room.</span></p></div>
