        <h1>Chapter 189 Lily Comes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried to dodge, but the metal bars trapped her, leaving </span><span>her </span><span>nowhere to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boiling water drenched her entire body. Aurora screamed in agony, collapsing and writhing on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin turned a horrific shade of red, blisters erupting within seconds, creating a gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was already weak from the surgery, and now she didn't have the strength to fight off this sudden wave of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wounds tore open, blood streaming across her battered skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia stood nearby, laughing hysterically at Aurora's suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> </span><span>heaved heavily. "Aurora, why do you make this so difficult?" he said. "If you'd cooperate, you could avoid all this physical torment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes burned with pure hatred, locked on her tormentors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cynthia, Hubery&mdash;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">may you both meet the worst end imaginable</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two luxury cars </span><span>stopped</span><span> before Orley University of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel shot a cold sneer at Ethan. "Would you quit being so annoying? Everyone knows Lily can't stand you, yet you keep pushing yourself into her life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan ignored Samuel and turned to Darren. "</span><span>So</span><span> this is your brother? You're so sharp, but he looks like some hot-headed punk. I'd never have guessed you two were related."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was taken aback, realizing the girl his brother liked was the same one Ethan was after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face darkened. "Watch your mouth! You and your whole family are all punks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel!" Darren intervened, holding him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel huffed with frustration, "Come on, Darren! Why are you taking his side? Are you my brother or his? I should never have brought you along to meet Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lily emerged from the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel quickly waved to catch her attention. "Lily, over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Samuel and Ethan together gave Lily an instant headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truthfully, she wanted to avoid both of them entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to pretend she hadn't heard them when Ethan's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan pulled out his phone, surprised to see it was Daniel calling. He answered urgently, "Daniel, how are Mr. Hawke and Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ethan mention Aurora, Lily quickly strode over, straining to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's voice came through with a panicked edge. "We were hit by a landslide in the mountains. Mr. Hawke's legs are completely crushed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Ethan's face went pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily demanded, trembling, "What about Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel continued, his tone grave, "Ms. </span><span>Elvador's</span><span> kidney transplant was successful, but... but the moment she regained consciousness, she was kidnapped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt her world spin, the words hitting her like thunderbolts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had just undergone a kidney transplant and was still exceptionally weak. Being kidnapped at this moment could be fatal; any potential infection would surely kill her in her fragile state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily couldn't bear to wait any longer. She grabbed Ethan's arm frantically, her voice urgent. "Get me there right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn't waste a second. He immediately jumped into the car, with Lily climbing in beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the gas pedal to the floor, and the engine roared to life. The car shot forward like an arrow released from a bow, leaving everything behind in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel's face turned serious as he took in the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing how dire things were, he jumped into the driver's seat, started the car, and tailed Ethan closely, with Darren by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two cars sped down the road, the scenery flashing by in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the passenger seat, Lily's fists were clenched so tight her knuckles went white. Her eyes were bloodshot, burning with a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, you've got to hold on. I'm coming to save you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whoever dared to kidnap </span><span style="font-style: italic;">you</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> will pay with their life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, three other people were on the move: Bertha's real parents and her brother, Brandon Zion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family's financial support, Brandon had to return home from abroad. Once he learned the truth from his parents, he was filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing how his sister had been abandoned in the mountains and left to be humiliated, his anger toward Aurora became intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been biding their time for revenge, and now that moment had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, the three of them got the news of Bertha's death from Cynthia. She also gave them Aurora's current address</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia hung up the phone, feeling utterly delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, however, frowned and asked, "Why did you call them over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" she replied with a smirk. "Of course, to make them </span><span>get back on</span><span> Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you crazy? They'll kill </span><span>her</span><span>!" Hubery exclaimed frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia let out a cold laugh. "No, you're wrong. They won't kill Aurora that easily. They'll torture her mercilessly. She'll wish she were dead but won't be able to die. I'll even film her suffering and broadcast it online for the whole country to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? Aren't you afraid of Julian coming after you?" Hubery pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coming after me?" Cynthia replied with complete indifference. "When I kidnapped Aurora, I stopped caring about his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wanted to seduce that bastard and get some perks out of him at first. But he was just insane, forcing me to eat so many cakes that I gained weight and developed diabetes. Now that I've got nothing left, why should I be scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who should be scared isn't me&mdash;it's Julian, that fucking jerk. I can't wait to see how devastated he'll be when he finds out Aurora is missing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia approached Aurora. At this moment, Aurora </span><span>was</span><span> unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wounds were infected, and she was burning with a high fever. Her face was bright red, her lips dry and cracked, looking thoroughly miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery looked at Aurora with deep compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s sick. Could you buy her some medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia </span><span>just</span><span> slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with contempt. "You're pathetic. No wonder Aurora can't stand you&mdash;hell, even I can't stand a man like you. She doesn't care about you, so why the hell do you care about her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words grew more venomous. "If I were you, I would have forced myself on her the moment she got out of prison. She's an ex-convict&mdash;who would believe anything she says?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued her brutal assessment. "If you had taken her back then, she never would have met Julian. She wouldn't have had anyone to protect her. </span><span>All in all</span><span>, you're just </span><span>too </span><span>weak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face burned from the slap. Cynthia had humiliated him so many times that murderous thoughts started to simmer just beneath the surface. Yet, deep down, he knew she was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been too soft, always feeling guilty about Aurora, and that weakness had led her to completely disregard him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he'd been more assertive when she got out, he could've forced her into marrying him. Back then, he was a lawyer who could provide for a family&mdash;Aurora would have been just a housewife, cooking and raising kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery stared intensely at Aurora, who was burning up with fever. "This is all on you, Aurora," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia slapped him on the shoulder, her voice dripping with cruel encouragement. "That's more like it. She's just a worthless woman</span><span>,</span><span> and she's right here. If you want her so badly, why don't you just take her now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a callous motion, she unlatched the iron cage, grabbed Aurora's clothing, and roughly yanked her out. She threw Aurora at Hubery's feet like a discarded piece of trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A golden opportunity won't come twice. If she dies soon, you'll never get another chance. You two grew up together, and you're so in love with her. Are you really going to</span><span> </span><span>watch from the sidelines without being able to touch her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's expression shifted, a cruel glint finally flickering in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Aurora had to die, she would die as his woman first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the afterlife, she would belong to him and him alone.</span></p></div>
