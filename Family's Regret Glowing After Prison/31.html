        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's body trembled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora's biological parents, they had failed to take care of her from the start, leading to her being lost at birth&mdash;a grave dereliction of their parental duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adopting another daughter to soothe their pain was one thing, but Aurora had suffered immensely in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't return home until she was fifteen, only to endure three years of torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She worked hard to get accepted into a prestigious university, only to be framed and sent to prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was released, she was skin and bones, with a broken leg&mdash;a testament to the abuse she endured behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, just when she thought she could finally catch a break, she faced a new round of cruelty from these monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Salmon chowder was something Bertha usually despised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, as Daisy tried to take the last bowl to Aurora in the hospital, Bertha was fighting to keep it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy knew Joshua and Celeste were aware of Bertha's dislike for salmon, but they still favored her, completely disregarding Aurora's broken finger and fragile state in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>felt that Aurora's fate as a Elvador was nothing short of tragic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had a daughter of her own, and she couldn't bear to think how heartbroken she would be if Lily were treated this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sympathy for Aurora and anger toward the Elvador family swelled inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted nothing more than to throw the scalding contents of the thermos in Joshua's cruel, smug face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily needed money for school, and Daisy needed this job. She lowered her eyes and swallowed her rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes gleamed with malice, and a triumphant smile played on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"I don't like salmon, but I won't let Aurora have it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Daisy, if you care so much about her, I'll make you lose your job over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Then, you'll be the one in pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Bertha was about to pour salt on the wound, a loud crash echoed through the room, startling everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to see a shattered vase on the living room floor, and Barnett standing on the second floor, his expression cold and menacing as he glared at Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's eyes flickered with panic as she met his gaze, and she quickly wiped away her smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett descended the stairs, each step heavy and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence was so powerful that even Joshua and Celeste were momentarily subdued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His footsteps were like hammer blows on the floor, sending shivers down the spines of those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Barnett strode up to Bertha, snatched the bowl of salmon chowder from her hands, and smashed it on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bowl shattered, and the chowder splattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha let out a scream and clung to Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you laughing just now?" Barnett's eyes were locked on Bertha's face. "Tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha shook even harder. "Barnett, I wasn't laughing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was both shocked and furious. "Barnett, have you gone mad? You've frightened your sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett met her eyes and said, "Mom, is Bertha the only one you see? Is Aurora not your own daughter? She was driven to chop off her own finger last night. Can't you feel any pain for her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned pale, and she stammered, "I... I naturally feel pain for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was so faint it carried no weight at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett roared, "Then why, knowing full well that Bertha doesn't like salmon, did you give her the chowder instead of taking it to Aurora? Aurora is so thin. Mom, can't you see? Can't you tell who needs the nutrition more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea what Aurora has lost? She..." Barnett stopped abruptly, unable to continue as he thought of Aurora's missing kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just twenty-three, she had spent five years in prison, broken her leg, and lost a kidney. Her future seemed bleak and finite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes were bloodshot with pain. "Mom, Aurora is your own daughter. Can't you just be kind to her, for once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was speechless. Faced with Barnett's accusations, she felt deep guilt and tears began to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Joshua barked, his face dark and menacing. "Watch your tongue! You're speaking to your mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm truly ashamed to have a daughter as morally corrupt as Aurora. She's malicious and deserves to be despised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She chopped off her own finger. No one forced her. I say both her hands should be cut off to keep her from pushing anyone else down the stairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was so furious that he spouted lies without blinking, convinced of his own righteousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett met his father's gaze, his face filled with disappointment. "When Mom gave birth to Aurora, she begged you to take care of her, but you fell asleep. That's why Aurora was stolen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she hadn't been lost, she would have received a proper education and would be far more accomplished than Bertha. Ultimately, we owe her. So why do you say she deserves this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stolen at birth and raised in an orphanage, she lived the most miserable life despite being a wealthy heiress. Does she really deserve all this suffering?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Barnett's scathing and unrelenting accusations, Joshua felt his blood rush to his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with rage, the humiliation of his shattered authority burning within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful son!" Joshua raised his hand and slapped Barnett hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow sent Barnett's head snapping to the side, and blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last flicker of hope in his eyes was extinguished at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Aurora had lost her hand, broken her leg, lost a kidney, and become an invalid, did he finally feel a pang of conscience and want to treat her better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed it was all too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett forced a bitterly ironic smile, which looked even more jarring against the blood on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he laughed, hot tears finally burst forth, streaming down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora must deeply regret ever coming back to this family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wiped the blood from his mouth and turned to Daisy without another glance at Joshua, Celeste, or Bertha. "Daisy, take the food to Aurora. Buy her whatever she wants. And if anyone tries to take it from her, I won't hesitate to cut off their hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was as cold and hard as ice, sending a chill down everyone's spine.</span></p></div>
