        <h1>Chapter 203 Barnett's Side Story I</h1>
        <div><p>With a dull, heavy clunk, the prison gates creaked open. </p><p>Barnett stepped out, his buzzcut catching the sun, his movements sluggish from a decade behind bars. The harsh daylight cut across his eyes, making him squint against its sudden intensity. </p><p>Ten years—it felt like a dream. Or maybe a nightmare. </p><p>The world beyond the gates looked both familiar and foreign, like waking up in a life that no longer belonged to him. Everything felt distant, unreal, as though it belonged to someone else&#x27;s memory.</p><p>Then the past came rushing back, dragging him ten years into the past. </p><p>Back to that day when he stood outside this very gate, full of pride and arrogance, waiting to pick up Aurora after her release. </p><p>He had doubted her limp, mocked her mercilessly. </p><p>Five years in prison—he dismissed it as if it were nothing, hardly worth a shred of sympathy.</p><p>But now, after losing ten years of his own life, he finally understood.</p><p>He understood what it meant to be caged, to be forgotten. To be stripped of dignity and drowned in suffocating silence.</p><p>He looked up at the street, the trees, the pale blue sky—unchanged, yet drained of color. </p><p>Everything was the same, but he had changed. </p><p>And in his eyes, the world was nothing but gray.</p><p>Once, he had stood here expecting someone—Aurora. Now, he was the one being released, and no one had come. </p><p>The space in front of the gates was empty. The silence echoed louder than any voice.</p><p>Alone and disoriented, Barnett drifted down the street, his feet moving on their own. Eventually, he reached the intersection. The traffic light turned red, and he stopped, staring blankly ahead.</p><p>A black Rolls-Royce eased past. Through the open window, he caught a fleeting glimpse—a girl in an Orley High School uniform.</p><p>The girl had her hair tied in a high ponytail, her skin smooth and luminous, her eyes wide and bright with youthful energy.</p><p>She smiled with carefree joy—a picture of innocence and warmth.</p><p>She was beautiful, no doubt. But that wasn&#x27;t what stopped Barnett in his tracks.</p><p>It was the uncanny resemblance.</p><p>She looked just like Aurora.</p><p>Barnett froze.</p><p>His heart lurched in his chest, and before he knew it, he was running—</p><p>Chasing the car, his voice hoarse and urgent.</p><p>&quot;Aurora!&quot; he shouted.</p><p>But the Rolls-Royce was already disappearing into the distance, its sleek form swallowed by the traffic.</p><p>He stood there, breathless, watching it vanish.</p><p>A bitter smile crept across his face.</p><p><em>How could I be so foolish?</em></p><p><em>Aurora was twenty-three when I went to prison.</em></p><p><em>Ten years have passed—she&#x27;d be thirty-three now.</em></p><p><em>There&#x27;s no way she could still look like that.</em></p><p><em>That girl...</em></p><p><em>She couldn&#x27;t have been more than thirteen.</em></p><p>Inside the Rolls-Royce, Aria glanced into the rearview mirror, curiosity flashing in her eyes.</p><p>&quot;Dad,&quot; she said, &quot;that man... it looked like he&#x27;s chasing our car. I think he called out Mom&#x27;s name.&quot;</p><p>Julian&#x27;s gaze sharpened, his expression darkening.</p><p>&quot;He probably mistook us for someone else,&quot; he replied, his voice low and unreadable.</p><p><em>Ten years.</em></p><p><em>Time has passed so swiftly. </em></p><p><em>Even Barnett has finally walked free.</em></p><p>*****</p><p>Barnett walked for more than three hours before he finally reached home.</p><p>Standing at the gates of the Elvador Villa, he froze.</p><p>The place before him was unrecognizable.</p><p>The iron gates were caked in rust, the front yard choked with weeds. The once-manicured flowerbeds had grown wild, a tangle of thorns and overgrowth. </p><p>It was clear no one had cared for the property in years.</p><p>Cracks lined the villa&#x27;s exterior walls, the paint peeling away in long, curling strips. The entire house looked like it was crumbling under the weight of time and abandonment.</p><p>Barnett&#x27;s chest tightened.</p><p><em>What is this?</em></p><p><em>No... no, this can&#x27;t be.</em></p><p><em>Where is everyone?</em></p><p>In the ten years he&#x27;d been locked away, not a single soul had come to see him. </p><p>He knew nothing about what had happened beyond those prison walls.</p><p>Now, as he stood before the wreckage of what used to be his home, he finally understood what Aurora must have felt—the deep, bitter loneliness of being forgotten.</p><p>He remembered her sitting silently in his car after her release, accused and humiliated, telling him no one from her family had visited her during those five years. </p><p>Back then, he hadn&#x27;t believed her.</p><p>Now, he did.</p><p>Barnett felt a deep bitterness rising in his chest. </p><p>He took a long breath, trying to steady himself. Slowly, he stretched out his hand and pushed open the rusted gate with force. The corroded metal creaked loudly.</p><p>He stepped into the villa. Inside, everything was exactly as it had been ten years ago. Nothing had changed.</p><p>Except for one thing. Ten years ago, the house was spotless. Now, a thick layer of dust covered every surface.</p><p>&quot;Dad, Mom, Aurora... Where are you?&quot; His voice echoed through the empty villa.</p><p>He looked around. The familiar furniture and decorations quietly told stories of a once-warm home. But now, only silence remained.</p><p>Barnett walked around the vast villa, searching for traces of the past.</p><p>He walked past his parents&#x27; room, where their belongings were still arranged as they had once been, though now they were all covered in a thick layer of dust.</p><p>He stepped into his own room. Everything was arranged just as he remembered it, but it all felt so unfamiliar now.</p><p>Finally, he went to the storage room where Aurora had once lived.</p><p>He remembered clearly. </p><p>The last time he stepped into that room, he had found her award certificates and her acceptance letter to Vertar University.</p><p>That moment had devastated him. The guilt he felt for Aurora nearly crushed him. He had even vomited blood.</p><p>He had also seen her diary, though he hadn&#x27;t had the courage to open it then, overwhelmed by his pain.</p><p>As he stepped into the space again, everything in the storage room remained exactly the same as it had been ten years ago.</p><p>The desk, the folding bed, and the cluttered corners... it was all exactly the same as before.</p><p>Barnett slowly walked to the desk, pulled open the drawer, and found the old diary still lying quietly inside.</p><p>He took it out, sat down on the folding bed, and gently opened it to the first page.</p><p>The paper had yellowed with age, but the handwriting remained perfectly clear.</p><p>Barnett&#x27;s fingers brushed lightly over the worn pages as if he could feel the emotions Aurora once poured into every word.</p><p>[June 12th, 2007. Friday. Sunny.]</p><p>[I have a mom and dad now, and a super handsome older brother who&#x27;s a CEO.]</p><p>[They came to the orphanage and brought me home.]</p><p>[I went from being a nobody—just an orphan no one cared about—to the real daughter of the Elvador Group.]</p><p>[It feels just like a dream.]</p><p>[For as long as I can remember, I used to wish I had parents. I never thought a wish like that could actually come true.]</p><p>[My dad is tall and dignified. Even though he&#x27;s older, he&#x27;s still really handsome—like a proper gentleman from a movie.]</p><p>[My mom? She&#x27;s stunning. Tall, elegant, and curvy, always dressed to the nines, like she stepped out of a fashion magazine.]</p><p>[And my brother... he&#x27;s got every good trait they have. Seriously. He&#x27;s perfect.]</p><p>[I feel so, so lucky to be part of the Elvador family.]</p><p>Barnett recalled the day they brought Aurora home, every detail as clear as if it were happening right in front of him.</p><p>It had been a bright, sunny afternoon. He&#x27;d driven with his parents to the orphanage to bring Aurora home.</p><p>The moment they entered, she was standing at the entrance, watching them nervously.</p><p>She was wearing a faded, worn-out dress. Her hair was a little messy, and her expression held a mix of anxiety and hope.</p><p>Barnett had frowned the moment he saw her, his voice full of disdain. &quot;She&#x27;s so short and scrawny. Are you sure she&#x27;s really my sister? She doesn&#x27;t look like part of the Elvador family at all.&quot;</p><p>He hadn&#x27;t even thought before saying it. He had made sure she heard. It was a deliberate attempt to put her in her place.</p><p>Aurora&#x27;s face turned bright red. She lowered her head, standing there helplessly.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t argue or explain. She just quietly followed them to the car.</p><p>During the drive home, she sat stiffly in the backseat, too afraid to move, as if any little shift would trigger another outburst from him.</p><p>Back at the house, she stood in front of the villa, staring up at the grand building in awe. Her voice trembled with wonder. &quot;Is this really my home now? I get to live here? Mom, Dad, Barnett, I feel so happy. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m dreaming.&quot;</p><p>He had no intention of letting her enjoy the moment. Sneering, he mocked her, &quot;Look at you. You&#x27;re like some bumpkin who&#x27;s never seen anything nice before. It&#x27;s just a villa. You&#x27;re clearly here for the money. Let me be clear. This house is under Mom&#x27;s name. Even if it&#x27;s passed down, it&#x27;s going to Bertha. Not you. Don&#x27;t even think about it.&quot;</p><p>Aurora&#x27;s face instantly turned pale, deeply hurt by his words.</p><p>She lowered her head and whispered, &quot;Barnett, I&#x27;m not here for the money. I just wanted a family.&quot;</p><p>He only scoffed in response, saying nothing more.</p><p>As she stepped into the villa, her tiny figure cast a long, lonely shadow under the sunlight.</p><p>There wasn&#x27;t a shred of sympathy in Barnett&#x27;s heart, only coldness and contempt.</p><p>He had never imagined how deeply his words could cut her.</p><p>And now, as he sat in the storage room where Aurora had once lived, flipping through her diary, the details he had once ignored pierced his heart.</p><p>He finally understood that every smile she showed was hiding disappointment and sorrow.</p><p>She kept trying to find her place in this home, and he just kept pushing her away.</p><p>&quot;Aurora, I was wrong,&quot; Barnett whispered, voice cracking as tears finally slipped down his face.</p><p>It took a long time before he could calm himself enough to turn the next page.</p><p>[June 13th, 2007. Saturday. Cloudy.]</p><p>[This is my first day living in the Elvador Villa.]</p><p>[Since it&#x27;s Saturday, I got up early to make breakfast for everyone.]</p><p>[I really wanted to be helpful... to feel like part of the family.]</p><p>[I hoped they&#x27;d like it. I really did.]</p><p>[But I never expected Bertha to have an allergic reaction. Her skin broke out in hives, all red and swollen.]</p><p>[Mom, Dad, and Barnett were furious.]</p><p>[They didn&#x27;t even ask what happened. They just looked at me with disgust.]</p><p>[They scolded me. Harshly.]</p><p>[It broke my heart, but I didn&#x27;t argue.]</p><p>[Because of me, Bertha had to go to the hospital.]</p><p>[So even when they yelled, I stayed quiet.]</p><p>[I believe if I give them my whole heart, one day they&#x27;ll see me differently.]</p><p>Barnett&#x27;s memory dragged him back to that day.</p><p>That day, seeing Bertha&#x27;s face covered in hives, he instantly exploded in rage. He rushed up to Aurora and shoved her hard.</p><p>She was so fragile. Just that light push made her fall against the dining table.</p><p>The dishes on the table clattered to the floor, shattering into pieces.</p><p>Aurora fell into the shards, and both her hands were cut open, blood pouring from her wounds.</p><p>Not only did he not care about her injuries, but he also became even angrier, shouting, &quot;I just pushed you, and you&#x27;re pretending to fall? Don&#x27;t think we can&#x27;t see through your lowly tricks! You hurt Bertha, and now you want to harm me too? You want to make Mom and Dad disappointed in us, and then take the family fortune for yourself? You&#x27;re truly wicked!&quot;</p><p>Aurora&#x27;s eyes filled with tears as she shook her head. &quot;Barnett, I didn&#x27;t, I swear...&quot;</p><p>He coldly interrupted her, &quot;Enough. I don&#x27;t have a sister like you. In my heart, the only sister I have is Bertha.&quot;</p><p>He didn&#x27;t spare a second thought for the blood on Aurora&#x27;s hands. Instead, he scooped up Bertha and rushed off to the hospital with their parents, not returning until late that night.</p><p>By the time they came back, the dining room had been cleaned. Aurora was sitting alone on the living room couch, waiting for them.</p><p>Seeing them return, she took the initiative to approach and asked with concern, &quot;How is Bertha? Did the doctor say she&#x27;s alright?&quot;</p><p>He, however, thought that Aurora was just pretending to be concerned.</p><p>His father said coldly, &quot;If you really feel sorry for Bertha, then stay here and pray for her tonight. Talking means nothing at all, but only actions show sincerity. If you&#x27;re unwilling, then leave right now. Our family has no place for someone as malicious as you, who would even hurt your own sister.&quot;</p><p>Aurora felt a twinge of despair, but she gritted her teeth and prepared to follow her father&#x27;s words.</p><p>&quot;Dad, Mom, I&#x27;m sorry. I was wrong. I&#x27;ll reflect on it,&quot; she whispered.</p><p>He watched her without the faintest bit of sympathy.</p><p>Then, he just said coldly, &quot;You&#x27;re such a phony.&quot; With that, he went upstairs.</p><p>He thought she&#x27;d get up and go to her room once everyone was asleep.</p><p>To his surprise, when he woke up the next morning, he found Aurora collapsed in the living room, her face as pale as death, and she had developed a high fever.</p><p>At the time, he sneered. &quot;Don&#x27;t think you can get our attention by deliberately making yourself look like this. Someone like you, with no upbringing, must have learned all sorts of tricks in that orphanage. I&#x27;m the CEO of the Elvador Group. Don&#x27;t think I can&#x27;t see through your little schemes.</p><p>&quot;If you want to play unconscious, then let&#x27;s see how long you can keep it up. Someone, throw her out into the yard. I want to see how long she can keep up the act.&quot;</p><p>It rained that day. Aurora was thrown into the yard and left to stand in the rain for over an hour. It wasn&#x27;t until Daisy couldn&#x27;t bear it anymore and begged for her that they allowed Daisy to bring Aurora back inside.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, the rain had caused Aurora to develop pneumonia. Her already frail body, combined with the night she spent praying, weakened her immune system. The pneumonia turned into white lung disease, and after being hospitalized, she was given a critical condition warning.</p><p>At that time, his father was extremely worried, bringing in the best doctors and the finest medicine to treat Aurora.</p><p>Back then, he had thought it was simply love. Now, he realized it was because if Aurora died, Bertha wouldn&#x27;t be able to receive a kidney transplant.</p><p>Barnett sat on the folding bed, the diary having slipped to the floor.</p><p>His hands were clenched tightly, his knuckles turning white.</p><p>Tears fell onto the yellowed pages, soaking into the paper, and spreading blotchy stains.</p><p>&quot;Aurora, I&#x27;m sorry. I was wrong. Where are you?&quot; he said, his voice trembling.</p></div>
