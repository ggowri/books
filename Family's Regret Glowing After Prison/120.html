        <h1>Chapter 120 He Is Gay</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, the yellow light in the coffee shop filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows and spilled onto the smooth floor, casting patches of mottled light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan saw that Lily had her head lowered, her hair like a curtain covering most of her face, and she hadn't said a word for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought she was still bothered by what happened last night, so his voice softened involuntarily. "I gave you the money not to humiliate you. I just want to compensate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily slowly raised her eyes. Tears welled up in her eyes, and her face looked pathetically charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I... I'm not hurt, sir. You don't have to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it. Otherwise, I won't have peace of mind," said Ethan earnestly, his eyes full of sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily wanted to snatch the card right away, but she had to keep up the act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of reluctance appeared on her face, and she frowned slightly, looking hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan patiently persuaded her from the side, his voice gentle yet persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lily, with a pitiful expression, was reluctantly stretching out her hand, a shrill voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who</span><span>&rsquo;s here</span><span>! Isn't this Lily, the best student who gets the scholarship every year at Orley University of Technology?" It was a shrill female voice filled with deep mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, did you hook up with another rich guy?" Right after, a male voice chimed in teasingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan and Lily turned their heads simultaneously and saw a couple standing beside </span><span>them at some point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young lady had a meticulously made-up face with an extremely thick foundation, like wearing a mask. But her eyes were filled with undisguised meanness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man stood slovenly, tilting his head with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sized them up and was sure she had never seen them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since she had been framed by Barnett last time and almost got expelled from school, it seemed that everyone in the school thought they could step on her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter who they were, they would mock her when they saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, as long as it didn't affect her, Lily just ignored those people, like water off a duck's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it affected her, like when the people in her dormitory used her toiletries to clean the toilet to disgust her, she would never let them get away with it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a cold glint of murderous intent appeared in Lily's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the couple taunted Lily, they looked at Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had originally thought that Lily had hooked up with a pot-bellied old man, but they were surprised to see such a young man in front of them, who seemed to be only twenty-five or twenty-six years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was dressed in a neat suit with every fold exuded refinement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, and the eyes behind the lenses were deep and bright. He looked handsome and exuded an air of gentle elegance, even more outstanding than the campus heartthrob of Orley University of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two saw the Rolex on Ethan's wrist, their eyes narrowed abruptly and were filled with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young lady </span><span>got jealous of Lily and</span><span> said, "Sir, don't be deceived by her. She was kept by an old man before and almost got expelled from school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man echoed, "Yeah. If her mother hadn't come to the school and pleaded in the principal's office, she would have been kicked out of our school long ago. It hasn't been three months since that matter happened. I can't believe she's still up to her old tricks, trying to swindle your money. You shouldn't give money to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young couple looked serious, coordinating "perfectly" as if they had seen Lily become the mistress of an old man with their own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was shocked, looking at Lily in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gritted her teeth, thinking, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm so close to getting the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I take his money now, he will investigate me and find out that Barnett used me to blackmail Aurora. As Barnett's friend, he surely won't let me go and may even cause trouble for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora has suffered enough. I can't cause trouble for her by attracting another rich jerk. It seems that I can't take the money away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was so angry that she wanted to kill those two assholes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her tongue hard, and the intense pain hit her instantly, making her eyes turn red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily bit her lower lip, her body trembling slightly, looking like a poor soul who had been humiliated to the extreme but was too afraid to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed away Ethan's hand that was holding the bank card, her voice tinged with </span><span>sobs, looking wronged and helpless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe it or not, I never wanted your money. What happened last night was an accident. It's not your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she suddenly stood up, pushed roughly the couple away, and ran out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Ethan felt his pity grow stronger. At the same time, he felt extremely disgusted with this couple who had provoked Lily without reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also stood up, took a step, and was about to chase after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the young man reached out to block his way. "She's faking it. </span><span>Don&rsquo;t pity her</span><span>.</span><span> She&rsquo;s not worth it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's eyes instantly turned icy cold. He wasn't a patient person, and he said coldly, "Since when did my business concern you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple was intimidated by his imposing manner, their faces turning pale. But they didn't dare to be presumptuous anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan then strode out of the coffee shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lily had already run to the other side of the road and was about to enter the campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was anxious and shouted, "Lily</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that was how the couple had called her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stopped in her tracks, her back facing Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there was no trace of the pitiful look on her face. Instead, it was filled with burning anger. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment she turned around, she adjusted her expression quickly, and the anger on her face disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she turned around, what she saw made her eyes widen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man dressed very "flashy" suddenly hugged Ethan's waist like a koala, burying his head in Ethan's arms and crying pitifully. The wailing sound could be heard from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was startled when he was suddenly hugged and instinctively wanted to push the man away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shouted, "You're all bastards. Why didn't anyone come to find me? Do you know how scared I was, being locked in the toilet for a day and two nights? Bastards. You're all bastards</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cried and punched Ethan's chest with his fists, looking exactly like a wronged wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan looked down and realized that the one crying and hugging him was none other than Simon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ethan hadn't seen Simon, he would have almost forgotten about Simon completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, Simon was a complete mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair was as messy as a bird's nest, strands of it tangled together. There were several bloodstains on his face that had already scabbed over. His clothes were torn to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had known Simon for so long. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a stylist, Simon </span><span>cared very much about his look</span><span>.</span><span> He would never allow himself to be disheveled out in the public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Simon reeked of a strong toilet smell from head to toe now, and the smell almost made Ethan vomit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, seeing Simon's pitiful appearance, Ethan resisted the urge to vomit and gently patted Simon's shoulder to comfort him, asking, "What happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You tell me!</span><span> It's all your fault for leaving me alone in the hotel. I hate you." Simon cried even louder, with tears and snot all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's head was hurting from Simon's crying. But he couldn't get angry and could only be patient and comfort Simon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing on the other side of the road, Lily watched as the two men hugged each other, one crying his heart out and the other patting his back affectionately to comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was like a thunderbolt, leaving Lily stunned</span><span>, especially when she realized that Ethan was gay</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Lily lost all interest in Ethan and thought that Ethan had given her money probably not because he had almost had sex with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily then turned around without looking back and strode into the campus, not wanting to look at Ethan again.</span></p></div>
