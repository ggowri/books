        <h1>Chapter 113 Keeping Barnett Busy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sank into the goose-down pillows, the bedside lamp casting a shimmering light on the ring, making it glisten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rubbed the ring, as if it still carried Julian's warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She curled her fingers close to her heart, the satin nightgown gathering into alluring </span><span>folds at her waist. Her smile, like a rose soaked in honey wine, quietly bloomed in the night mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in another bedroom, the frosted glass of the bathroom was blurred by the swirling steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the rising mist, Julian's back muscles rippled like waves as he dried off. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water droplets clung to his sculpted body, catching the light like diamonds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quiet ten minutes, the glass door swung open, releasing a warm, cedarwood-scented steam into the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually wrapped a towel around his waist, with water dripping from his hair onto his chest and tracing down his abs into the towel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had this raw, magnetic appeal, adding a laid-back, almost reckless vibe to his usual cool demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After picking</span><span> up a towel nearby</span><span>, he</span><span> leisurely dried his hair. His every movement radiated elegance and composure, exuding an irresistible handsomeness and allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drying his hair, he casually tossed the towel onto a nearby chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked barefoot across the soft carpet. The steam gradually dissipated behind him, leaving only the powerful aura he emitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked to the window and carelessly pulled open the heavy curtains. Then he lazily reclined on the goose-down cushion of the lounge chair. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curve of his crossed legs resembled an unsheathed scimitar. The rocking chair swayed gently with his movements, emitting faint creaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were half-closed, and the rain on the glass cast flowing shadows on his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze pierced through the rain curtain, landing on Barnett, who was kneeling outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was already drenched by the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked at him, raising an eyebrow as if appreciating a well-choreographed farce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Barnett's self-punishing attempt to force Aurora to forgive him was both foolish and ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a cigarette case from the table beside the rocking chair, took out a cigarette, and lit it with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As h</span><span>e </span><span>took a deep drag, the smoke slowly </span><span>enter</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>his lungs before being exhaled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white smoke drifted like a delicate veil, spreading before him and blurring his mocking expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While smoking, he leisurely enjoyed Barnett's "performance".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like the ruler of this world, casually toying with mortals in his boredom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when alone would he let his true emotions surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cigarette was soon finished. As he crushed the butt, sparks burst into tiny golden glints at his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the table, producing crisp sounds that broke the brief silence in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his movements paused. Then his half-closed eyes slowly opened, revealing those deep, slightly cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian murmured, "I need to find him something to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up his phone and dialed Ethan's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ethan didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Julian frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dialed again, but still no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called a third time, only for it to hang up automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian glanced at the time on his phone&mdash;10 p.m.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan must still be awake. </span><span>He probably just didn't hear the ringtone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Julian wasn't in a hurry. He put down his phone and continued sitting in the rocking chair, watching the lightning and heavy rain outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, on the coastal boulevard, a black Maybach cut through the rain and finally stopped at the entrance of Orley University of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, the scent of sandalwood intertwined with the jasmine fragrance from the girl's hair. Ethan glanced at the girl in the passenger seat, who was nervously twisting her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were brimmed with tears</span><span>, and her white T-shirt, stained with alcohol, revealed her slightly slender figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked over and said softly, "Thank you for bringing me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft, carrying a tone of sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's gaze held a hint of curiosity. He raised an eyebrow and teased, "You really are a student, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl pursed her lips, her fingers slightly curling, appearing somewhat uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her silence, Ethan raised his eyebrow again. "Since you're still a student, you should avoid places like that. If you hadn't run into me, you could've been taken advantage of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't wanted to go there either, but working at the bar paid better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother had been fired by the Elvador family, and she just wanted to work to ease her mother's burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded and whispered, "I'll take my leave now." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she reached to open the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait." Ethan's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily paused, looking at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan picked up an umbrella and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The umbrella gleamed with a metallic sheen under the car's interior light, looking exceptionally refined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was momentarily stunned, then smiled gratefully and took the umbrella, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to step out, she added, "Sir, how should I return this umbrella to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the "Maybach" logo on the umbrella handle, Lily shook her head firmly. "This umbrella is too valuable. I must return it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother had worked for the Elvador family for many years, so she recognized </span><span>luxury car logos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that umbrellas matching such cars weren't cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan found this amusing. "Alright, I'll come pick it up myself tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't notice his intrigued expression and replied earnestly, "Okay, I'll wait for you at the school gate tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the car door, stepped out, and turned back to say, "Sir, drive safely." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she opened the umbrella and walked into the campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan watched Lily's figure disappear into the school gate before slowly driving away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still savoring his conversation with Lily, unconsciously smiling. Her simplicity and stubbornness had added a bit of fun to his otherwise mundane night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car moved steadily through the rainy night, raindrops constantly hitting the windshield, blurring the view outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan held the steering wheel with one hand and casually picked up his phone with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw three missed calls from Julian, his lips twitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed lightly and muttered to himself, "The music at the bar must have been too loud.</span><span> So,</span><span> I didn't hear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed the callback button, put it on speaker, and waited for&nbsp;Julian to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian answered the call and said, "</span><span>So, you had a lot of fun, huh?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan laughed in response, "</span><span>Oh, Mr. Hawke, you do know me well</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chuckled, not bothering to ask what Ethan had been up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got straight to the point. "Barnett has been too idle lately. Bankrupt the Elvador Group and keep him busy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Ethan roll his eyes in exasperation</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that a late-night call from Julian never meant anything good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ethan felt no sympathy for the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the deadline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked at Barnett, who was still kneeling on the ground, swaying unsteadily. He sneered, "Before dawn."</span></p></div>
