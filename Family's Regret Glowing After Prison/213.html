        <h1>Chapter 213 Aurora's Epilogue VII</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the early morning, the bright sunlight streamed in through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora slowly woke up from her deep sleep. As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw Laura gazing at her with such tender affection, her love almost tangible in her eyes. Aurora had never seen such a maternal look on Celeste's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Laura saw Aurora's eyes flutter open, she leaned in and gently kissed her soft cheek, inhaling the unique scent of her little girl. "Good morning, sweetie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't help but feel a little speechless at Laura's fondness for smelling her, but she still obediently responded, "Good morning, Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was completely smitten by the sight of her looking so adorable, still half-asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, tomorrow is your birthday. Today, I'm taking you out to buy a few beautiful dresses. I'm going to make sure you look like the most gorgeous little princess at your birthday party tomorrow." Laura's eyes sparkled as she spoke, clearly excited to dress her little girl up for the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "And tomorrow, your dad and I will announce in front of all the guests at the Putnam event that you're officially the eldest daughter of the Barron family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora met Laura's expectant gaze, and a warm feeling spread through her heart. She had almost forgotten her own birthday. In her past life, she had never celebrated a birthday. Before she turned fifteen, when she was at the orphanage, no one ever remembered her birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was with the Elvador family for those three years, they only ever remembered Bertha's birthday. Every time, they would invite all the wealthy and prestigious people for a grand celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one ever remembered that she and Bertha were the same age and that she, too, had longed for a birthday celebration. While Bertha received presents and praise, she was always left in the corner, completely forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, in this new life, she was finally going to have her own birthday party. Aurora's eyes stung with unshed tears as the emotion overwhelmed her. She quickly lowered her gaze to hide the redness in her eyes. "Thank you, Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gently stroked her head. "You're my precious girl. Don't worry about thanking me. Every year, your dad, brother, and I will celebrate your birthday, and you'll have everything that other kids have. Alright, now go get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded and went into the bathroom, where she found the toothpaste squeezed neatly into place. She began washing her face, and after she was finished, she reached for a comb to tidy her hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the comb was quickly snatched away by Laura. "Come here, let Mom do your hair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a surge of gratitude but gently refused, saying, "Mom, I can do it myself. Ms. Kaur says we should take responsibility for our own tasks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Laura's face momentarily flashed with disappointment. She just wanted to be close to Aurora at every moment, to do little things like combing her hair. It was such a small wish, but Aurora had turned it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Laura feel a little helpless, but at the same time, she was proud to have such a mature and independent daughter. Still, she longed to pamper her, dress her up beautifully, and show her off like a precious gift to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura's pout, Aurora's heart softened, and though reluctant, she gave in. "Alright, how about you do my hair? I'm sure you'll do it much better than I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's expression instantly brightened, and she cheerfully began styling Aurora's hair. Laura's hands moved deftly as she braided Aurora's long hair, skillfully weaving it into a neat pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched in awe at the intricate process, realizing she could never do it herself. Meanwhile, Laura was enjoying every moment, completely absorbed in the task. When she finished, she added a pink bow at the top of Aurora's head. Now, Aurora looked even more like a little doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura called, "Benjamin, William, come see how gorgeous Aurora looks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and William entered the bedroom together, and when they saw Aurora, their eyes practically sparkled with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin said proudly, "No doubt, she's my daughter. She is so beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William grinned. "No doubt, she's my little sister. She is so cute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They showered Aurora with compliments before going on to pick out dresses for her. Benjamin held a white princess dress in his hands. William, on the other hand, had a pink princess dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin said, "Aurora, wear the one Dad picked for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William chimed in, "The one I picked is much prettier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them was willing to back down, and Aurora couldn't help but feel incredibly loved, yet also a little overwhelmed. In the end, she wore the pink princess dress that William had chosen, but to keep things fair, she asked Benjamin to pick out a white cardigan to wear over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought this would satisfy both of them. But then, the two of them started debating over whether she should wear pink or white princess shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could only facepalm.</span><br><span>Has Bertha been this spoiled by Joshua and Barnett when she was little too? Sure enough, a father's love is heavy and almost too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sighed deeply and finally gave in, wearing one pink and one white shoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin gave her a thumbs-up. "I told you Aurora is the best. Not only is she smart, but she also has a great sense of fashion. This 'mismatched shoe' style is just perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pulled Aurora into a big hug, planting a loud kiss on her chubby cheek. "You are a born fashionista. You're amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura gazed at Aurora with starry eyes. "Oh my gosh, when you're dressed up, you look like a little fairy! How can you be this beautiful? My precious baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was speechless.</span><br><span>That's enough. I'm starting to worry they might spoil me too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole family went on and on, praising Aurora, with no hint of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Aurora was all dressed and ready, Benjamin scooped her up into his arms. "Aurora, Daddy has to go to work and won't be able to take you shopping for dresses. But don't worry. I'll definitely be there for your birthday tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora cupped Benjamin's handsome face in her hands. "Don't worry, Daddy. You go to work. Mom and William will be with me." She paused for a moment and added, "I'll miss you, Daddy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a thoughtful girl," he said, kissing her cheek before placing her gently in Laura's arms. "Honey, I'm leaving now. Take good care of Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura nodded. "Okay, be careful on your way."</span><br><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Benjamin left, Aurora was taken out by Laura and William. They went to the biggest children's clothing store in Putnam. Laura and William were both overwhelmed by the sheer number of princess dresses to choose from. If it was suitable for Aurora, they wanted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tried on dress after dress, each one making Laura and William gasp in admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one is beautiful. Buy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one is great too. Let's get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this one's even better. We'll take it!"</span><br><span>Aurora was stunned. The store seemed endless, with over a hundred dresses picked out, all by Laura and William. These two were even more excited than Aurora, and it almost felt like they were spoiling her too much. Aurora was starting to get a little nervous about how much they were buying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking over at the store staff, they couldn't stop smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wanted to speak up and stop them, but she knew it wouldn't make a difference, so she just let them have their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her looking a bit bored, the staff member kindly suggested she sit down on the couch. "Would you like something to drink? I can get you a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had tried on so many clothes and was a little thirsty. "Thank you," she said, flashing a big, sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store clerk was completely charmed by Aurora's polite and well-behaved demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The country encourages having children, right? The little girl in front of me seems like every woman's dream child. She is so cute and polite. Having one will be a dream come true. I won't even mind having two babies like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura and William picked out over a hundred clothes for Aurora, and she patiently tried them on one after another without crying or throwing a tantrum. The staff member had been working for nearly ten years, but she'd never seen such a well-mannered child before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a happy heart, the clerk went off to get Aurora a drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, three people walked in. The woman was dressed in high-end brands, looking every bit like a wealthy socialite. She carried an LV handbag in her left hand and held the hand of a five-year-old girl in her right. The girl's other hand was being held by a ten-year-old boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family of three was stunningly good-looking, exuding an air of confidence and grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, take a look at the dresses and pick the ones you like. Mommy will buy them for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our little princess deserves every beautiful dress in here," the boy said, looking at the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This children's store is huge, even bigger than Orley's biggest one," the girl exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked over in their direction, and when she saw who had entered, her body shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Celeste, Barnett, and Bertha. She had known that someday she might run into them, but she never imagined it would be so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was as stunning as ever, looking even younger than Aurora remembered. She was in her thirties, but her well-maintained appearance made her look around twenty-five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett hadn't grown into his tall, imposing figure yet, but that arrogant expression on his face was exactly the same as Aurora remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Bertha&mdash;she truly looked every bit the pampered princess of the Elvador family. She wore a puffy dress, her long hair tied in a bun, adorned with a crystal hairpin. Her entire appearance reeked of wealth as if it had been bought with money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this was where Celeste and Barnett had brought Bertha to play, back in their past life. Aurora, on the other hand, was still in an orphanage at this time, with no new clothes, let alone the concept of a vacation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pushed down the resentment bubbling inside her and quickly averted her gaze. She was still too young. As long as they didn't come after her, she could set aside the hatred from her past life for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quietly sat on the couch, saying nothing and avoiding looking at the Elvador family. But even though she wasn't seeking trouble, trouble found her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, with a pout, complained, "This mall is so big, but there aren't any pretty dresses." She sulked, clearly unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste and Barnett looked around and indeed didn't see any particularly outstanding dresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a store clerk walked over with a glass of milk and handed it to Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Aurora said as she took it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk patted her head affectionately. "You're welcome." She was more than happy to help such a sweet and polite child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, walking over with Barnett and Bertha, asked, "Do you have any other dresses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clerk smiled and turned to Bertha, "Are you buying a dress for your daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded. "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so sorry, but all the beautiful dresses in our store have already been reserved," the clerk replied, pointing to the bags that had already been packed. There were several more, waiting to be packed, scattered around the floor and near Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha immediately spotted a light purple princess dress. She ran over, hugged it, and said, "I like this one. Mommy, buy it for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. If you like it, we'll buy it," Celeste said, quickly adding, "Please pack this one for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett pointed to the other beautiful dresses on the couch. "Why don't you see if there's another one you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Bertha said eagerly, shoving the purple dress into Barnett's arms and beginning to dig through the pile of dresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, who was sipping her milk, furrowed her brows.</span><br><span>Do these people not understand what the clerk has said? The dresses had already been reserved, yet they still insisted on picking and choosing as if nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have they even asked for my opinion? Oh, that's right. The Elvador family never cares about anyone else's opinion. If Bertha likes something, they will simply take it without asking anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What could I do if I didn't agree? All I'd get in return would be insults and humiliation from them. I had lived through that in my past life. And this time, if they think they can bully me again, they're seriously mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gently placed the milk on the coffee table before extending her hand and pushing Bertha, who was busy picking out dresses, aside without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was in excellent health, and though she and Bertha were both five years old, she was taller by half a head and stronger. With that push, Bertha lost her balance and fell hard onto the floor, landing with a painful thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Used to being pampered, Bertha had always been the one to bully others, and this was the first time she had been pushed around. She immediately burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked down at her coldly, her gaze icily detached. "Did you ask for my permission before touching the dress I picked out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, seeing her crying, rushed to pick Bertha up, her face filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, who had a notoriously bad temper, immediately stepped forward, ready to strike Aurora. "How dare you bully my sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before his hand could come down, Aurora swiftly grabbed her cup and splashed the milk in his face. "And what gives your sister the right to touch what I've chosen for myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, seething with anger, lunged at Aurora, ready to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the store clerk quickly stepped in front of Aurora, shielding her from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura and William had already picked out over a hundred dresses, each worth five figures. The total was easily over a million dollars. A family who could casually spend over a million dollars had to be incredibly wealthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since they were in Putnam, a place known for its affluent residents, the clerk could not allow Aurora to be bullied in her store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Although the three newcomers appear wealthy, their accents suggest they're from out of town. I'm not about to sacrifice my local clientele for the sake of outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Please, let's all calm down. These dresses have already been reserved, but you're welcome to check out other options."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was livid when she saw that the clerk was siding with the little girl who had bullied Bertha. "Is this how your store does business? Do you believe I can't get your store shut down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at the scene unfolding before her with a sneer. As expected, whether in this life or the last, the Elvador family never had any sense of reason. But this was Putnam, not Orley. The Elvador family couldn't expect to have everything their way here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Aurora started crying, shouting, "Mom, brother, someone is bullying me. I'm scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura and William, who had been picking out dresses, froze when they heard Aurora's crying. They dropped the dresses in their hands and rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouted, "I dare anyone to bully my baby."</span></p></div>
