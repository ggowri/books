        <h1>Chapter 88 Anything For You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was still unconscious, the effects of the anesthesia lingering heavily in his system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, his brows were furrowed tightly, as if even in his sleep he couldn't escape the unbearable torment gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, after being rushed through emergency treatment, had also slipped into a deep slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stood outside the hospital room, watching silently as both men were wheeled inside by medical staff. His mood was </span><span>bad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that ever since Aurora disappeared, everyone who had wronged her had begun to suffer one misfortune after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization that Aurora wasn't the real culprit behind turning Camille into a vegetative state hit him like a freight train. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when he thought about the hellish five years Aurora endured in prison, it made his chest ache with an indescribable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this karma? Is our cruelty finally coming back to haunt us?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lingered outside the room for what felt like hours before dragging himself away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd originally intended to return to his own ward, but something about Camille's erratic behavior earlier nagged at him. Uneasy, he changed course and entered her room instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There she lay on the bed, wide awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since waking from her coma, she hadn't dared shut them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd already lost five years of her life trapped in that limbo-like state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared closing her eyes now would send her spiraling back into that living nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adolph stepped in, all he saw was her staring blankly out the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille," he said softly, but she didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing, he moved closer, leaning down slightly. "Camille, I'm here to see you. Aren't you happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Happy?</span><span> Camille sneered and thought. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he truly cares about me, if he </span><span style="font-style: italic;">see</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s me as his little sister, he wouldn't have sided with Bertha. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After everything I've been put through, including the trauma and the injustice, and after Aurora has unjustly spent five years rotting in jail for a crime she didn't commit, how can he simply let it go? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can he stand there acting like nothing happens? This isn't a visit out of love or concern. No, this is mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the question that had been eating away at her since she woke up: why hadn't their parents come to see her? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the accident, they doted on her endlessly. There was no way they wouldn't rush to her side upon hearing she'd regained consciousness. It meant only one thing that they didn't know. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Adolph hadn't told them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood perfectly well why. Once her parents arrived, they'd demand answers. They'd dig until they uncovered the truth about what really happened five years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To protect Bertha, Adolph has gone to great lengths, even hiding my recovery from our own parents. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hasn't he claimed he doesn't care for Bertha? Hasn't he chased after Aurora relentlessly during high school, even planning to break off his engagement with Bertha because of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet now, when Bertha's sins threaten to come to light, his loyalty suddenly shifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He would rather deceive our parents, would rather let me suffer, and would rather allow Aurora to continue carrying the stigma of attempted murder than see Bertha harmed in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. He doesn't deserve to call himself my brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And his words are nothing but hollow lies dripping with hypocrisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Camille refused to look at him. All she wanted was for her body to heal quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph noticed that Camille showed absolutely no reaction to what he had said, and the smile on his face began to falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he pressed on, swallowing his discomfort and speaking in a helpless tone, "Still mad at me, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused and continued, "I know what you're thinking. But I can't do what you want me to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my sister," he said firmly. "Everything I've done has been for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For me?</span><span> Camille sneered and pondered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, for my sake, he is willing to let me suffer? Is he allowing the real murderer to walk free while an innocent girl rots in jail somehow justified? Before I woke up, he sacrificed Aurora to shield Bertha. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that I'm awake, why isn't he doing the same to bring Bertha to justice? Does loving Aurora mean hurting her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille could move right now, she would slap him across the face without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she turned her head slowly, meeting his gaze. But her eyes blazed with pure hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to tell him to get lost, but she couldn't move, nor could she speak. All she could do was glare at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph mistook her anger for childish stubbornness. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling faintly, he reached out and patted her head like she was a petulant child. "Come on, Camille. Don't be difficult, okay? You need to rest. Getting upset isn't good for your health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Camille only felt her anger flare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sharp and desperate scream echoed only in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated his refusal to see the truth. She also loathed herself because she was trapped in this useless body, unable to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes blazed with fury, as if they were trying to </span><span>burn</span><span> Adolph who had utterly shattered her trust and left her feeling nothing but bitter disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph shifted uncomfortably under her piercing stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avoiding her eyes, he busied himself rearranging items on the bedside table, rambling on, "In a few days, once you're feeling better, I'll send you abroad. It'll be easier for you to recover there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word he spoke felt like a dagger being ground deeper into her already raw wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she burned with the need to expose the truth to clear Aurora's name and make Bertha pay for her crimes, he wanted to ship her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chest heaved with barely contained rage, each breath searing like fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at him, she seemed to see a monster. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every fiber of her being screaming in protest, she summoned every shred of strength left in her weakened body. Her throat burned as though branded by flames, but she managed to force out a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph froze, clearly taken aback by the venom in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise flickered in his eyes. Sighing deeply, he shook his head. "Camille, you're grown up now. It's time to start acting mature."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That patronizing tone ignited her fury like gasoline poured onto an open flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands clenched the sheets instinctively, knuckles whitening with the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips trembled, yearning to unleash the storm raging within her, but all that escaped was a ragged gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of how close she was to breaking, Adolph kept talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha grew up with you. You were spoiled rotten as a kid, and she was the only one who stuck by you. I don't want you to lose your best friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides," he added earnestly, "I trust Bertha. Whatever happened back then, it wasn't intentional. She must regret it, too. Can't we just let it go? She's such a sweet, innocent girl. You must know that because she is your best friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every syllable felt like a dull blade slicing through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with disbelief as she stared straight at him, as if she were looking at a complete stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed in her heart, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Best friend? That woman turned me into a vegetable and sent Aurora to prison. Friend? Sweet? Innocent? Bertha? What </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the hell?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille hadn't overheard that despicable conversation between Bertha and her father weeks ago, maybe she'd still believe that Bertha was some angelic figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because she had overheard the secret that Camille had been targeted and met with such a cruel fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Celeste and Barnett clung desperately to their delusions, willing to destroy their own flesh and blood to protect Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille </span><span>firmly believed that o</span><span>ne day, they </span><span>would</span><span> pay for their stupidity. Karma always f</span><span>ou</span><span>nd its way home</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Adolph prattle on, blind to reality, Camille felt breathless. It felt as though an invisible hand was squeezing her throat, cutting off her air supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her vision blurred until the world spun violently around her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to catch her breath, she was overwhelmed by a surge of fury as her head lolled to the side. Then she fainted dead away, driven to collapse by Adolph's words.</span></p></div>
