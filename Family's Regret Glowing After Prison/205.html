        <h1>Chapter 205 Barnett's Side Story III</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett suddenly grabbed Aria's arms, his eyes fixed on her face, filled with guilt and remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at the man sitting in front of her, confused. "Sir, do you know my mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mother?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the face identical to Aurora's, he was so overwhelmed with emotion that he didn't even notice that the person in front of him was just a twelve or thirteen-year-old child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Aria's reminder did he realize the person in front of him didn't match Aurora's age.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett carefully examined the child in front of him. Although she looked very much like Aurora, upon closer inspection, he realized that the two were entirely different.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had never experienced love, and as a result, she had grown up with a sense of inferiority. Her long-term malnutrition had left her with dry hair, pale skin, and a body that seemed to be nothing but skin and bones.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the girl before him was different. She had shiny, straight hair and smooth skin, and her face lacked any trace of insecurity. Instead, it radiated confidence and nobility. She was clearly a child raised in an environment filled with love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's eyes turned red as his voice trembled. "You say Aurora is your mother?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Sir. Who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's tears spilled uncontrollably. He pulled Aria into an embrace, holding her tightly. "I'm your mother's older brother. You should call me uncle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, Aria had been distant but polite toward Barnett. But the moment she heard him say he was Aurora's brother, her expression darkened. Then, she pushed Barnett away with force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, caught off guard, fell to the ground, sending water splashing everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up and met Aria's cold gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart sank, and he hurriedly scrambled to his feet, reaching out as if to touch Aria's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that if he treated this face with tenderness, he could somehow make up for all the wrongs he had done to Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had always longed for familial love. She dreamed that her parents and Barnett would treat her with kindness, gently caressing her, praising her. If they had only shown her even a fraction of the love they gave Bertha, she would have been content.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even this humble wish had never been granted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Barnett wanted to touch Aria, but to his surprise, she took a step back, rejecting his touch. His hand fell to empty air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled, unable to believe it, staring at Aria, who looked at him with clear distaste. Aria was very averse to his touch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria wasn't like Aurora, starved for love. Besides not having a mother, she had everything else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father loved her. Her great-grandmother loved her. Daisy and Ashley loved her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown up in a loving environment, so why would she care about the affection of a so-called uncle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't have anything else, please leave my house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those cold words, Aria moved to walk past him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett blocked her way. "Can you tell me your name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at him expressionlessly. "I warn you, don't try to associate with me. I don't have an uncle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words hit Barnett like a heavy blow. "Did someone say something to you? Don't listen to them. I may be meeting you for the first time, but I truly care about you. We're family. We share blood."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was young, she wasn't an ignorant little girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't even love your own sister, and yet you have the nerve to say you care about me? Do you think I'm an idiot?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not like that. There's been a misunderstanding between me and your mother. I've been misled by bad people, but once your mother and I clear things up, everything will be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help your uncle, alright? Go get your mother. I have so much to say to her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria sneered. "You are really ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and walked toward the door, not sparing him another glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett tried to continue to plead, but he was stopped by the driver. He could only watch helplessly as Aria entered the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett sat in the water, his hands weakly falling to the ground. His voice was hoarse and choked with emotion. "Aurora, I know I'm unforgivable. For the past ten years, I've been tortured in hell. All I ask is for a chance. I'm willing to spend the rest of my life making up for my sins."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria stood by the window on the second floor, watching the man outside, crying and pleading.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes involuntarily filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tell her? Tell who? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mom has gone. She left this world ten years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Aria had grown up in an environment full of love, she still longed for the companionship of her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around her had never avoided talking to her about her mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had told her that her mother was a top student, always at the top of her grade, winning scholarships every year, and the state's number one. She had passed the Scholastic Assessment Test and gotten into Vertar University.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley had told her that her mother was a kind-hearted person and also skilled at embroidery. Aria had seen her mother's embroidery before, and even after ten years, her mother's embroidery room still remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But such a wonderful mother, whom Aria never had the chance to see again, was killed by bad people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father Julian had said, "Aria, remember this. Good people are often taken advantage of. I can't protect you forever. You need to grow strong. If you are strong enough, no one will dare to bully you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The person outside actually has the nerve to claim he's my uncle. How shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the enemy sitting in the rain, sorrowfully and regretfully begging, she felt nothing but contempt. It all seemed like an act to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain grew heavier, and Barnett was soaked through, drenched like a drowned rat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he still insisted on staying in the rain, hoping that this display of suffering would make Aurora feel sympathy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still held on to a faint hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora cares about me so much. Seeing me like this, she'll surely come out to check on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, no matter how much Barnett degraded himself, Aurora never came out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sky grew darker, the heavy rain slowly began to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a black Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stepped out of the car, dressed in a black suit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to ten years ago, the man who was nearly forty now exuded a much stronger aura. His handsome face remained stern and expressionless, making it hard for anyone to look him in the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, Barnett immediately sprang to his feet, startled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of sitting for so long, when he got up, his legs wobbled, and he staggered a few steps, almost falling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to steady himself and, with a desperate look, asked, "Julian, where have you hidden Aurora? Did you give the order to stop her from seeing me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you, I'm Aurora's brother. She's always cared about me. If she knows you've stopped me from seeing her, she'll be furious."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked down at him, casting a sideways glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to see Aurora?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I want to see her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julian turned and walked into the villa, leaving Barnett standing there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett wanted to say more, but seeing how disheveled he looked, he decided against it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can I meet Aurora looking like this? I need to clean myself up and make sure I present myself in the best possible way tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I did make a lot of mistakes back then. But that was ten years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing time can't heal. Besides, I've spent ten years in prison, which is my way of paying back the debt I owe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora is so kind. I believe that as long as I apologize sincerely, she'll definitely forgive me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this hopeful thought, Barnett returned home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett had barely slept through the night. He kept replaying the past in his mind, the countless times he had hurt Aurora. Each memory had become a dagger to his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told himself over and over again that tomorrow he had to do better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what it takes, I have to earn Aurora's forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora is so soft-hearted. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After knowing I've served ten years in prison and seeing me in such a miserable state, she's bound to forgive me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Barnett got up early. He stood in front of the mirror, carefully tidied his suit, fixed his tie, and even sprayed on a hint of cologne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to appear decent and respectable. After all, this was the first time in ten years he would be seeing Aurora again. He had to make a good impression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath in front of the mirror before heading out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived at the Hawke Estate but was stopped at the gate by a guard. Barnett frowned, his tone impatient. "Move."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the guard didn't budge, simply replied coldly, "Wait here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face darkened, but remembering Julian's words, he held back his anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that if he made a scene, Julian really would stop him from seeing Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he clenched his fists and waited at the gate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minute by minute, his patience thinned, but he still didn't dare leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Julian and Aria came out from the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria wore a light pink dress, her hair was tied into a neat ponytail. She looked sweet and elegant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, as always, was in a black suit, radiating a powerful aura. His handsome face carried a stern expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them, Barnett rushed over and asked urgently, "Where are you going? Didn't you say I could see Aurora today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gave him a brief glance and said firmly, "If you want to see Aurora, get in the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart leaped when he heard this. He quickly opened the door and got in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the car was filled with fresh flowers. He was confused but didn't dare question it, thinking maybe Aurora liked flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After ten years, our first reunion. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe Aurora had arranged a hotel in advance. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, we're just going to the hotel for a meal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's fine. Eating together and talking will make it easier to improve our relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Barnett stayed quiet, staring out the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they drove further, he began to feel something was off. The car wasn't heading into the city. It was going toward the outskirts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nerves tightened, and he couldn't hold back any longer. "Julian, where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't respond. Barnett's unease grew. A heavy sense of dread settled over him, but he couldn't be sure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gripped the door handle tightly, trying to stay calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car slowly entered a cemetery, Barnett felt his heart sink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth, saying, "Julian, don't go too far. I want to see Aurora. Why did you bring me to a cemetery?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car came to a stop, and Julian, holding a bouquet of flowers, got out of the car with Aria.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ignored Barnett and walked straight toward the deeper parts of the cemetery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stumbled after them, his mind in chaos, unable to believe what he was seeing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can't be. I'm just overthinking it. How could Aurora possibly be gone?" he muttered to himself, his voice trembling with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step Barnett took was more difficult than the last. He followed behind Julian and Aria, still muttering, "This can't be, Aurora couldn't have..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cemetery was eerily quiet, with only the sound of their footsteps echoing on the stone path.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian and Aria stopped in front of a gravestone, gently laying down the bouquet of flowers. The two of them stood quietly there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad and I came to see you," Aria said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett slowly walked up, and as the words on the tombstone came into view, his world collapsed in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a despairing scream. "No... This can't be true. You must be lying to me. Aurora was fine when I went to prison, how could she have died..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears surged uncontrollably from his eyes, and his body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked at the out-of-control Barnett and said, "Today is the tenth anniversary of Aurora's death."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tenth anniversary? </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora has been gone for ten years?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So that means she passed away shortly after I went to prison?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible. I don't believe it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shook his head desperately, shouting at Julian, "You're just trying to make me suffer, aren't you? You're lying to me!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, if you dare curse Aurora again, I swear I'll fight you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria looked at Barnett's mad behavior, clearly upset, and said, "Shut up. You don't have the right to speak about my dad. My mom was killed by your family. I hate you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett was stunned. "Aurora really is gone? She was fine when I went to prison. How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked at him, his gaze cold. "Aurora became deaf, her legs were crippled, she lost a kidney, and while they were taking her kidney, they also injected her with ovulation hormones, forcibly harvesting more than ten eggs from her. Even with proper care, her body was already at its breaking point. But Isabella and Frank still wouldn't leave her alone. After kidnapping Aurora, they scalded her with boiling water and beat her..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and cold, each word cutting sharply into Barnett's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, please stop." Barnett covered his ears, his body trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Barnett</span><span>'</span><span>s face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I... I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know. I really didn</span><span>'</span><span>t know it would end like this. I thought...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice caught in his throat, choking off any more words. The guilt pressed down on him, suffocating and relentless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian let out a cold, scornful laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You thought? What you thought pushed her straight into hell.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>She died without hearing a single apology from you. Not once did she feel warmth from her so-called family.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett crumpled to the floor, clutching his hair like a man on the brink of madness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Aurora, I was wrong. I know I was wrong... I</span><span>...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice broke into sobs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn</span><span>'</span><span>t flinch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What use is regret now? Her life was ruined&mdash;because of all of you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed from Barnett</span><span>'</span><span>s mouth. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He doubled over in agony, but nothing could compare to the torment inside his soul.</span></p></div>
