        <h1>Chapter 210 Aurora's Epilogue IV</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was utterly confused as William practically yanked her along, dashing at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her short legs had a hard time keeping up with his rapid strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, they arrived at the backyard garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The garden was a veritable explosion of colors. Flowers were in full bloom, their sweet fragrance wafting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William guided Aurora into a lovely area filled with blossoming flowers and then turned to her, wearing a dead-serious look. "Aurora, how about we play hide-and-seek? You hide, and I'll come looking for you. But don't come out until I say so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't get it.</span><br><span>He dragged me all the way here just to play hide-and-seek?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora batted her big eyes, and William's heart just melted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Joe and Oliver see how cute Aurora is, they'll be over here every day just to get a peek at her. That means less time for me to spend with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't worried about Julian, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of all his friends, Julian was the least bothered about anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always had a poker face, and William knew Aurora wouldn't take to someone so cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to make sure Joe and Oliver didn't steal his adorable little sister away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gently held Aurora's chubby cheeks in his small hands. "You have to hide real good, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he really just want to play a simple game of hide-and-seek?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora thought it seemed fishy, but she decided not to say no. After all, she was the grown-up inside, and William was just a ten-year-old kid. It was better to humor him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora broke into a smile, her eyes curving like crescent moons and showing a row of pearly whites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I'll do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William couldn't help but be charmed by her grin. He leaned down and gave her a quick peck on the forehead. "You're such a sweetie, Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took off, leaving her to find a place to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora snuggled deeper into the flower bed, where the colorful petals partly hid her small figure. As the gentle breeze played through the branches, it filled the air with a soft rustling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She closed her eyes and let the surrounding sounds wash over her&mdash;the rustle of leaves and the faint whispers of the flowers swaying in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora'd been deaf for so long that by the time she died, she'd even started to forget how to use language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, having gotten a second chance, she cherished every sound, every bit of joy. Her world was no longer silent; it was full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The symphony of nature&mdash;the rustling leaves and the mixed scents of different flowers&mdash;filled her with pure happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the villa, William barged through the door only to find Joe and Oliver rushing in, with Julian sauntering in at his own relaxed pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will, where's your sister? Bring her out to say hi!" Joe exclaimed. His playfully messy hair bounced as he got all fired up, and his eyes were lit up with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, wearing a cocky smirk, spoke up, "Yeah, I wanna see if your sister is cuter than mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian kept quiet, his expression as calm and unreadable as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William let out an over-the-top frown and spread his arms wide, blocking their way. "What are you guys doing here? I'm not letting you see my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe let out a chuckle and leaned in closer. "Oh, come on! Don't be such a spoilsport."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver added, "That's a laugh coming from you! If you didn't want us to see her, why'd you post that pic last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd posted that photo just to brag, not to spark a competition over his cute sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted people to shower her with compliments, not have these guys butt in and steal her focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nope means nope!" he said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we're not budging until we lay eyes on her!" Joe and Oliver dug in their heels, dead-set on meeting Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was so preoccupied with fending off Joe and Oliver that he barely noticed Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian cast a disinterested look at the three of them, then turned on his heel and strolled out of the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He preferred the spacious and peaceful backyard. Making his way towards the rear garden, he held his small frame upright with determination. Each step he took was measured and unhurried, as if the world's chaos couldn't touch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Aurora had been patiently waiting in the flowerbed for what seemed like ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour of squatting, her legs started to go numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does William forget about me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh well, I'll just stand up and stretch my legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she got to her feet, the numbness took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Aurora rose, her legs gave way, and she stumbled forward, landing heavily on the ground. Right then, a pair of shoes appeared in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it was William, she put on a fake pout. "William, where have you been? I've been waiting for you in the flowers for ages!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked up while speaking, she was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in front of her wasn't William at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy standing there was bathed in sunlight, his face softly aglow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes seemed to sparkle like stars but held a frosty detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With delicate features, he had an air about him that demanded attention, even at such a tender age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was easy to picture him growing into a heart-stopper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loose strands of hair fell over his forehead, stirred by the gentle breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tilted his head slightly and fixed his eyes on Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, their eyes met. A flash of surprise tempered the coldness in his gaze as he sized up Aurora, who sat there, dazed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he reached out his hand, his voice cool and aloof. "Will's sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's mind went blank. She couldn't hear anything else; her world shrank to just the boy in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd dreamt up a million scenarios for their reunion, but this sudden and unexpected meeting was way beyond her imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he didn't match the tall, handsome image she recalled, Aurora recognized him right off the bat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the ray of light that had cut through her darkest days and pulled her out of the pit of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Mr. Hawke&mdash;Julian, a mere ten years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the cherubic look and the baby fat still on his cheeks, it was already obvious that he was the kind of guy who kept people at arm's length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gorgeous, ice-cold eyes were frigid, yet they triggered a flood of nostalgia in Aurora, making her feel like she could burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, nothing else mattered; he was her entire universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgetting about the numbness in her legs and the pain from the fall, Aurora sprang to her feet and rushed towards Julian, throwing her arms around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, I finally found you again," she blurted out, her voice quivering with a mix of overwhelming emotion and lingering pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wept without holding back, her shoulders trembling violently. Each sob seemed to be a release of all the sorrow and longing she had pent up from her past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears soaked through Julian's chest, and the warmth of them was so intense that it felt as if it could scorch his very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood there, flabbergasted. Confusion mingled with an unfamiliar sense of concern in his wide-eyed stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body went rigid, and his hands hung awkwardly in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will's sister?" he murmured, his voice so soft it was almost inaudible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lifted her head from his embrace. Her eyes were red-rimmed and her nose was pink from crying. Her small face was damp with tears, making her look utterly pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at Julian's young face with almost ravenous hunger, as if she were desperate to burn every feature into her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It was all my fault in my past life. I was just so insistent on going deep into the mountains to see poor Bertha's pitiable state with my own eyes. That silly whim of mine led to dear Mr. Hawke having his legs crushed by those huge rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I passed away so prematurely that I never got the chance to see his legs heal completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If his legs never fully recovered because of me, it would be more agonizing than if someone broke my heart into a million pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Hawke was always so kind and gentle to me. How heart-wrenching would it be for him to find my cold, lifeless body!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory made her tears pour down even harder. Between stifled sobs, she wailed, "Mr. Hawke, I missed you so much. I really, really did..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sorrow deepened, and she clung tighter to Julian's waist, scared stiff that if she let go, he'd disappear right before her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, who usually kept a poker face, looked at her in utter confusion as she sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"D-Don't cry," he stuttered, lifting his tiny hand to clumsily try to brush away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time someone had held him so tightly, and the first time a little girl had told him how much she'd missed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually sharp-witted Julian was at a loss at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why does she seem to like me so much, yet cry like her heart is breaking when we meet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to wipe away the tears streaming down Aurora's cheeks, but they kept coming, like an unstoppable flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through her sobs, she managed to blurt out, "Mr. Hawke, I won't leave you again. I'll never let anything happen to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't quite get what she was saying, but he felt an urge to make her stop crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since losing his mother, his heart had grown colder with each passing year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, seeing little Aurora sobbing uncontrollably broke down his defenses, and a surge of pity welled up in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to console her, William's angry voice suddenly boomed. "Julian, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William rushed over, pushed Julian aside, and wrapped his arms protectively around Aurora. "Julian, why are you picking on my sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Aurora out of his arms, Julian felt an unexpected pang of emptiness in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attitude changed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth he'd shown Aurora vanished as soon as he faced William, replaced by a cold, detached look. "I didn't pick on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, William retorted, "If you didn't pick on her, then why is my sister crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian fell silent. He had no clue why she'd started crying the moment she saw him, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not saying a word is as good as admitting it," William insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe and Oliver exchanged bewildered looks, still trying to make sense of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, Aurora squirmed out of William's protective hug. "William, he didn't bully me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his sister's tear-streaked face, William said sincerely, "It's all right, don't be scared. I'm here to protect you. Just tell me the truth&mdash;did he hurt you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched by her brother's unwavering backing but not wanting Julian to take the rap, Aurora shook her head vigorously. "No, seriously, it's not like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William frowned, clearly skeptical. "If he didn't hurt you, then why are you bawling your eyes out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were things from her past life that she couldn't spill the beans about. After a moment's thought, Aurora replied, "Because... because I like him. I felt so happy that I cried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This confession hit William like a thunderbolt, leaving him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I just got my sister yesterday, and she hasn't even said she likes me yet. But she meets Julian for the first time and falls for him just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Aurora, as if trying to read her face to see if she was pulling his leg. But her earnest expression left him with no option but to believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you... you just met him, and you're already smitten with him?" William's voice carried a hint of betrayal, mixed with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded eagerly. "Yeah, I like him very much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, William felt his heart break into a million pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julian listened to Aurora's confession, a faint blush stole across his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, when he saw her photo, he thought she was a real cutie and couldn't wait to meet this little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing her in the flesh today, she was even more adorable than in the picture. His heart just melted. She was so sweet and huggable, a sight that disarmed him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe and Oliver exchanged excited looks, their eyes twinkling with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, they were practically jumping up and down with glee.</span><br><span>Holy cow, this little girl is so chubby and soft! Just like Will said, she's a doll!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All fluffy, I'm totally smitten with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe, the daring one, grabbed Aurora's tiny hand.</span><br><span>Whoa! I just touched her little hand. It's as soft as I've always pictured it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, let's play house! I'll be the groom, and you can be the bride, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to be left out, Oliver spoke up, tugging at her other hand, "Nah, I wanna be the groom! You be the bride, and let your brother be the dad, and Julian can be the mom! Hee-hee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his precious sister about to be snatched away by Joe and Oliver, William frowned. "Aurora doesn't want to play these kiddie games. Right, Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her big eyes darted back and forth between Joe and Oliver. Seeing their eager-beaver faces, she broke into a wide grin. "I'm up for playing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe and Oliver whooped with joy, jumping around like little kids on a sugar high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, William looked like his world had just crashed down, his face falling in utter disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paying no heed to him, Joe and Oliver leaned in closer. "So, Aurora, who's gonna be your groom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both boys stared at her with bated breath, fully expecting her to pick one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their utter shock, Aurora's eyes landed on Julian, and she pointed at him. "I want him to be my groom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wriggled free from Joe and Oliver and marched right up to Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the stunned silence of the others, she gracefully dropped to one knee in front of him, looking all serious. "Will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd been deaf, had a limp, and even lost a kidney. Through all those tough times, Julian had never turned his back on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his grandma had nudged them to get closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could feel the quiet, deep-seated affection Julian had for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reborn in a healthy body, she was dead set on living life differently this time around. No longer weighed down by past screw-ups, Aurora could go after what her heart truly wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was set on choosing Julian, no matter if it was just a silly game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was caught completely off-guard by her bold move. He stood there like a deer in the headlights, his face flushing a bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the tips of his ears were as red as a cherry, and his eyes popped wide open in total shock. His mouth hung slightly ajar, but he was too stunned to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, William watched the scene unfold, feeling like his heart had been smashed into a million little pieces.</span></p></div>
