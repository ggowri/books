        <h1>Chapter 27 Repayment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, if you touch Daisy again, I'll kill you," Aurora threatened, her eyes blazing with a reckless intensity that cut through the air like a cold blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was taken aback, momentarily frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, his anger surged back like a tidal wave. "You ungrateful brat! How dare you threaten me? I'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the belt at Aurora again, his movements wild and uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy quickly threw herself in front of Aurora once more to shield her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The belt cracked mercilessly against Daisy's back. She staggered but remained stubbornly on her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's tears flowed even more fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Kill him. Kill him. Kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the only thought echoing in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life had already been shattered. She had no future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was released from prison, she had hoped to find a place where no one knew her to live out her days in obscurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Elvador family wouldn't let her go.</span><span> </span><span>They wanted to torment her endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in too much pain. </span><span>N</span><span>o point in </span><span>staying with them</span><span>. She'd rather die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, she would drag them all down with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all her strength, Aurora pushed Daisy aside. Daisy stumbled backward, nearly losing her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the pain in her leg, Aurora sprinted into the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she emerged, she was holding a kitchen knife, her eyes locked on Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the knife in Aurora's hand, Joshua felt a flicker of fear. But he still bellowed, "Aurora, what are you doing with that knife? Are you mad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mad? Yes, I'm mad. You've driven me to madness!" Aurora screamed, her voice hoarse and eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swung the knife at Joshua without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, there was no hesitation or fear in her eyes&mdash;only boundless hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's face turned pale with terror as he instinctively dodged to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife whistled past his ear and struck the nearly six-foot-tall vase behind him with a resounding crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vase shattered into pieces, fragments flying everywhere and scattering across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrifying scene left everyone present wide-eyed with shock. They could see that Aurora was determined to kill. She was no longer just making empty threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was really terrified now. His legs began to tremble uncontrollably, and he backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected that Aurora, who had always silently endured all the beatings and humiliations, would now be willing to take his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When someone had nothing left to lose, fear belonged to the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua shouted in panic, "Aurora, this is criminal behavior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid of dying. Why would I fear committing a crime?" Aurora continued to swing the knife at Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua scrambled backward, losing all his patriarchal dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Celeste finally snapped out of her preoccupation with Bertha's delicate state. She rushed over and tried to stop Aurora. "Aurora, put the knife down. What are you doing? We're family. We can talk this through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk this through? That's hilarious..." Aurora laughed bitterly, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I wanted to talk, you wouldn't give me a chance. Now that I don't want to, you're trying to guilt-trip me. Am I supposed to be a punching bag for your entire family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, it's not like that." Celeste shook her head frantically. Seeing Aurora's irrational state, she felt as if her heart was being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, let me explain. It's not what you think. You can tell me anything that's bothering you. I'll listen with an open heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave a mirthless laugh. "It's too late for that, Mrs. Elvador. I don't want to talk. Out of respect for giving birth to me, I won't hurt you. But Joshua and Bertha have to die today. I'll turn myself in after I've killed them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face drained of all color, her eyes wide with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't do this. Killing is a crime. You're still young. You'll regret it. Please, put the knife down," she pleaded, her voice hoarse with fear and desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered. This was the true face of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she threatened to take them all down, they were willing to compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was beyond that point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regret? The only thing I regret is coming back to this family. Mrs. Elvador, tell me, have you ever regretted a single thing you've done to me? Where were you when I was in prison, being tortured? Where were you when I had my leg broken? You only had room in your hearts for Bertha, that outsider, never for me, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You </span><span>all </span><span>call me a monster, a criminal, but who's the real criminal here? Bertha! She framed me and sent me to prison, and you turned a blind eye. You even acted as accomplices, pinning all the blame on me. Now that I'm out, you still want to torment me. I'm not the one in the wrong! So why does everything become my fault? Tell me, tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's roar left Celeste trembling helplessly. "Aurora, it's not like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what is it like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speechless? I guess that means I'm right. Then let's all go to hell together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora raised the knife high again. The blade glinted menacingly under the lights as she swung it straight toward Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned ashen with terror. Without thinking, she threw her arms around Aurora and shouted, "Bertha, run! Go find Barnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora struggled like a wild animal caught in a trap. "Mrs. Elvador, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wailed through her tears, "Aurora, I'm your mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you're not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am. I gave birth to you. Aurora, listen to me. Please, stop this, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's struggle suddenly ceased, giving Celeste a glimmer of hope that she might have been persuaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, a mocking laugh escaped Aurora's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You gave birth to me? Yes. That's your trump card, isn't it? Well, I'll repay you for the 'gift' of life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was cold, her eyes filled with a chilling detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt a chill run down her spine. She had a terrible premonition that something even worse was about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she tightened her grip on Aurora, as if holding on could prevent the impending disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, Aurora found the strength to break free. She placed one hand on the table and looked at Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Elvador, your act of giving me life is worth one finger. I'll repay you with a severed finger." With that, she raised the knife and aimed it at her own finger.</span></p></div>
