        <h1>Chapter 112 The Tedious Performance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett fell to his knees in the mud with a thud, but the sound was swallowed by the thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howling wind, carrying raindrops, pounded heavily on him, causing him pain. Yet, this pain was nothing compared to the agony in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rainwater streamed down his forehead and cheeks continuously.</span><span> For a moment, he couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was raindrops or tears on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams were torn apart by the </span><span>wind</span><span>, and a metallic taste of blood rose in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled all the harm he had inflicted on Aurora in the past. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scenes of him humiliating Aurora for Bertha's sake were like needles in his eyes, stinging him with every blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each scene magnified and looped in his mind, tormenting him unbearably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm such </span><span>an asshole</span><span>! How could I treat her like that? Aurora&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heartfelt repentance moved even Darren, who stood beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren frowned, feeling both sympathy and a sense that Barnett deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">If he had known this day would come, why did he act that way?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Barnett is miserable, but compared to the suffering Aurora endured, his misery is less than a fraction of hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora was about to enter a top university but was wrongfully imprisoned and left with multiple disabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't imagine what </span><span style="font-style: italic;">she had</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gone</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">through in prison. She was beaten deaf, had a leg </span><span style="font-style: italic;">broken, and a kidney removed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How much torment did Aurora endure in those dark days?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Barnett's pitiful state, Darren couldn't bear it. He advised, "Barnett, Aurora can't hear you. You should go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Barnett, as if out of his mind, knelt on the ground, facing Aurora's room, and continuously slapped himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of slaps echoed in the rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Barnett's cheeks became swollen and red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was shocked and quickly intervened, "Barnett, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett pushed him away and roared, "Aurora can't hear, but she can see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pouring rain couldn't mask his torrential tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ruined Aurora, so I must atone. I will wait until she forgives me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a face full of sorrow, he continued to slap himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stood by, watching the seemingly insane Barnett, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora saw all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't moved at all, only felt that Barnett was putting on a show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time he had done it</span><span>, but after each repentance, he would still humiliate her for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already tired of his performances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only person Aurora cared about was Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her, Julian had fought with Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned quickly, dragging her heavy leg, and jogged out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed downstairs, desperate to make sure Julian wasn't hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, </span><span>Julian walked in from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His black shirt clung tightly to his body, outlining his chest</span><span> muscle</span><span> and </span><span>his eight packs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair was wet, with droplets continuously falling. Even soaked, he couldn't hide his innate elegance. The rain made him even more sexy and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke&mdash;" Aurora saw him and quickened her pace, but accidentally missed a step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's heart clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everything around him blurred, only Aurora's falling figure was crystal clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot like an arrow, breaking through the air, striding swiftly towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rainwater slid from his hair, across his cheeks, and gathered into droplets at his chin, splashing away with his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to hit the floor, Julian reached out and firmly caught Aurora's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was lifted by a pair of gentle yet strong hands and sat on Julian's lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's other hand protected her back, holding her securely in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, time seemed to stand still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the wind still howled, and the rain poured, but inside the living room, only their breaths could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian panted heavily, his deep eyes filled with concern and fear. He locked his gaze </span><span>on Aurora's eyes as if confirming her well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared blankly at Julian, so close, feeling his strong heartbeat and the warmth from his body. She gripped Julian's arms tightly as if she never wanted to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian keenly caught the worry in Aurora's eyes.</span><span> And he was deeply moved by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was like a hot iron, firmly locked on Aurora. His hand holding her arm involuntarily tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, feeling the pain, struggled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, immersed in complex emotions, </span><span>snapped out of it</span><span> and immediately loosened his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking</span><span> a deep breath</span><span>, he managed</span><span> to calm the turmoil inside. Then, he slowly took Aurora's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Aurora's astonished gaze, he removed his pinky ring, a simple yet exquisite ring that sparkled with a cold light on his fingertip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian slid the ring onto Aurora's middle finger, the action slow and devout as if performing a sacred ritual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ring slid over Aurora's knuckles and finally rested steadily on her middle finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart felt as if gripped by an invisible hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up, her eyes filled with confusion and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke..." Aurora's voice trembled slightly. She seemed shocked by Julian's sudden action, yet also suppressing the complex emotions rising from deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gazed at her, his voice deep and powerful. "Wear it, and you are mine. I will always protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice echoed in the quiet living room, carrying a power that reassured Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the window, Barnett was still </span><span>slapping himself</span><span> amidst the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora had no time to care about Barnett. She was overwhelmed by the sudden happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes moistened. Her heart was a mix of emotions&mdash;touched, surprised, but mostly filled with anticipation for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> </span><span>had noticed the ring on Julian's hand the first time she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always wore it, never took it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, </span><span>Aurora guessed he liked the ring very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had taken it off and placed it on her hand himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora wanted to ask Julian what it meant, was it what she thought?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't dare. She feared it was her own wishful thinking, yet also feared it was exactly what she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lowered her eyes, </span><span>feeling that her mood was on a roller coaster</span><span>.</span><span> She was happy, but then sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it, she found herself being lifted</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian effortlessly picked her up and step by step, carried her up the stairs.</span></p></div>
