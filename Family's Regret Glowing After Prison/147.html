        <h1>Chapter 147 Begging for Forgiveness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, seeing Frank injured, was filled with pain and rushed to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could reach him, Ethan kicked her hard in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, searing pain shot through her, and she instinctively clutched her abdomen, curling into herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wracked with agony, she rolled on the ground, gasping for breath, completely unable to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan let out a scoff and yanked a strand of Frank's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he strode over to Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was about to resist, but heard Ethan's cold voice, "You saw the consequences of not cooperating just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shudder ran through Joshua's body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was futile&mdash;there was no sense in making things worse for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a strand of his hair was plucked next. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lastly, it was Bertha's turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had previously ordered someone to shave Bertha's head, but after some time, the hair on the sides had started to grow back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ethan plucked a strand of her hair, she trembled uncontrollably, terror clouding her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all three strands of hair collected, Ethan handed them over to Darren</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Lowell, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll leave this to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, who had been watching the drama unfold, was in complete shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So this is the cruel truth behind why Aurora ended up in an orphanage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora was only twenty-three, and for over two decades, she had been hurt at every turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Joshua, this bastard, how could he treat his own daughter like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Absolutely despicable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora </span><span style="font-style: italic;">i</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s the only normal person in the Elvador family</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet, I had mocked her, given her nothing but coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren already felt guilty for Aurora, but after learning the entire pitiful truth, he despised himself even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted ever listening to Barnett and Bertha's lies, instead of using his own eyes to verify whether Aurora was really as terrible as they had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren took the strands of hair and said seriously, "Give me an hour, and I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make sure the tests are clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to leave, but suddenly felt someone clutching his ankle. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down, he saw Isabella, lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don</span><span>'</span><span>t go," Isabella cried out hoarsely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren looked at her with utter disgust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked Isabella aside with force and walked out with large steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, desperate, shouted at Darren from the floor, "I</span><span>'</span><span>m the director! If you don</span><span>'</span><span>t listen to me, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll fire you immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stopped and turned around with a disdainful expression. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You probably don</span><span>'</span><span>t know that Orley Central Hospital has shares from </span><span>our</span><span> Lowell family, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I became a doctor because I actually enjoy helping people. If I wanted to, the position of director wouldn't even be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to business dealings between the Elvador Group and the Lowell Group, Joshua had used this relationship to help Isabella climb her way to the director position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the </span><span>major</span><span> shareholder's eldest son, Darren only needed one word to kick Isabella out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So to him, the fact that she dared to pull rank on him as the director was downright laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Darren turned to look at Aurora, his eyes filled with both apology and determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was silently saying</span><span>,</span><span> "In the past, I failed you, but from now on, I will firmly stand by your side and protect you forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Aurora a deep, meaningful glance and then walked away without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into complete silence. No one spoke, and the atmosphere was so tense it felt suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Bertha, like a woman gone mad, rushed toward the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all she wanted was to escape this terrifying place. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even one more second here felt like torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Aurora wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sherwood family knowing the truth from five years ago wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t scary either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t even terrifying that Joshua had discovered she wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t his biological daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was terrifying was only one person&mdash;Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still vividly remembered what Julian had done on Beatrice's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was truly as ruthless as rumors said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those who had bullied Aurora were either maimed, disfigured, or had their teeth knocked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even his own father was spared; Julian had left him so traumatized that </span><span>his</span><span> sanity was hanging by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t imagine how cruel Julian would be when he wanted to take revenge for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she had to escape, even if it meant abandoning her own parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ran to the door and yanked it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, sunlight poured in, bathing her in warmth, as if calling her toward the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha</span><span>'</span><span>s face also lifted into a smile, as if she was about to escape the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw the man standing at the door, her smile instantly froze, and all that remained in her eyes was pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small, exquisite dagger gently lifted Bertha</span><span>'</span><span>s chin, forcing her to take a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she continued to retreat, the man holding the dagger slowly appeared in full view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was tall and imposing, his body wrapped in a black suit, which accentuated his broad shoulders, his long legs striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was cold, and his face showed no emotion, especially his eyes, which exuded a chilling aura of someone who had been through countless battles and seen endless bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back</span><span>!</span><span>" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel coldly uttered two words, his voice like a bullet, directly hitting Bertha's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pupils dilated as she stiffly turned around, reluctantly walking back to Isabella and Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua</span><span>'</span><span>s heart sank at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha</span><span>'</span><span>s instinctive reaction had already shown that she was closer to the driver Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they argued, Adolph looked at Aurora in pain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs gave way, and with a loud thud, he fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face as he said</span><span>, </span><span>"Aurora, I</span><span>'</span><span>m sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s face remained calm, without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her calmness made Adolph feel more despair than any anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because her calmness meant she had completely given up on him and no longer cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, his body began to sway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll atone for my sins. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll make it up to you. Even if you want my kidney, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll give it to you. Please don</span><span>'</span><span>t ignore me, please?" Adolph begged tearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how he begged, Aurora merely averted her gaze, her expression indifferent. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to hear another meaningless word from him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she didn't look at him, his voice became nothing more than empty noise, fading into irrelevance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her unmoved, Adolph lost all control and started slamming his head against the floor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy thuds echoed through the room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, his forehead split open, blood seeping down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth turned away, unable to watch. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Camille let out a sneer. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Adolph, don't you look exactly like Aurora did back then when you forced her to kneel by my bedside and beg for forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's movements halted abruptly, and he turned to look at Camille in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "That's right. I may not have been conscious, but I was fully aware. I remember everything you did to Aurora over the past five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how it felt? Every time I heard you standing by my bed, describing Aurora's suffering in prison, while you just stood by and did nothing, it was like pouring salt into my wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of this... was supposed to be Bertha's punishment. You treated Aurora with such cruelty while sparing Bertha, and yet you dare to claim you loved Aurora? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve her! She will never forgive you. You brought this on yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Adolph felt the world spin around him. His vision darkened, and his legs gave out beneath him, sending him crashing to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wilson and Lizeth instinctively moved to help him up, but Camille's words echoed in their minds, making them hesitate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting their teeth, they forced themselves to stay put, their eyes instead turning toward Bertha and the others, filled with seething hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room plunged into a suffocating silence, a silence that stretched on endlessly&mdash;until Darren suddenly rushed back, holding a set of test results in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Striding over to Joshua, he slapped the papers hard against his face and asked, "Now, do you finally get it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The DNA test results came in two copies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was for Bertha and Joshua, and the other for Bertha and Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua</span><span>'</span><span>s trembling hands picked up the report, and he read it word by word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his hopes shattered in that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The report clearly showed that Bertha was not his biological daughter, and Frank was her real father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This heavy blow hit Joshua like a thunderclap, leaving him half paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Celeste, who had been unconscious, slowly began to wake up.</span></p></div>
