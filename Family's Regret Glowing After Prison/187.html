        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You drugged me?" Aurora's face went ghost-white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's mouth curled up. "Wasn't me. The doctors did that when they jammed Bertha's kidney into you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been out cold the whole time - didn't know jack about any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't figure out why Mr. Hawke's got such a hard-on for trash like you," Cynthia spat. "Pretty face, that's it. You're useless otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know his legs got crushed by rocks trying to save your sorry ass? And with all that pain? He waited outside the operating room all day, making sure you got Bertha's kidney okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wouldn't let them touch him 'til they wheeled you to recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart felt like it was being ripped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes wild with panic, she choked out, "Julian, is he okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the fuck should I know? That idiot's got shit for brains. </span><span>World'd</span><span> be better if he just died," Cynthia snarled, looking straight-up psycho.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the elevator chimed as it reached the basement level. The doors slowly slid open to reveal a di</span><span>m</span><span> parking garage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia </span><span>wheeled</span><span> Aurora</span><span> o</span><span>ut while </span><span>she</span><span> fought desperately against her. "Where are you taking me? Let me go! I need to see Julian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia lost it when Aurora fought back, backhanding her so hard it split her lip open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, you little piece of shit - quit fighting! Now that I've got my hands on you, you're fucked. You </span><span>ain't</span><span> going anywhere, ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cynthia spoke, she grabbed Aurora by the hair and yanked her head upward, continuing her vicious tirade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That bastard Julian forced me to eat cake every day six months ago. </span><span>I'm getting fat as fuck. N</span><span>o matter how </span><span>hard</span><span> I tried to diet, I </span><span>just </span><span>couldn't lose it</span><span>!</span><span> I even developed diabetes! </span><span>He put me through hell, so now he can get a taste of what it feels like to lose the one woman he can't live without!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's laughter echoed maniacally through the garage. "And that whore Lily who cares about you so much? Imagine how heartbroken she'll be when she discovers you're missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just picturing her running around like a headless chicken, frantically searching for you in complete despair... God, that's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be sweet! Haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shoved Aurora toward a car and yanked the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora spotted who was inside, the hate rolled off her in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes went lethal as she spat, "Hubery, you and Cynthia set this whole thing up, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery flinched when Aurora's death glare hit him, but he bounced back quickly, putting on a fake, caring smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward slightly and reached out to caress Aurora's face, but she turned away in disgust, avoiding his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery didn't seem bothered by her rejection. He </span><span>said</span><span>, "Aurora, </span><span>we </span><span>are meant to be together. </span><span>Julian</span><span>'s</span><span> loaded</span><span>. Why would he ever be interested in someone like you? He's nothing but a con artist playing with your feelings. Being with him only means being his plaything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, his tone becoming earnest. "Aurora, stick with me. I'll treat you right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, you're the most shameless person alive," Aurora spat, looking at him like something she'd scraped off her shoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tired of wasting time on conversation, Cynthia roughly dragged Aurora into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anesthesia hadn't worn off yet, so Aurora couldn't break free no matter how hard she tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was scream for help. "Help! Someone's kidnapping&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could get the words out, Hubery slapped a cloth over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell hit her like a truck, and her blood ran cold. She knew this move all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she'd made a break for </span><span>Sounan</span><span> Station from the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa&mdash;Darren had taken her down the exact same way. Cloth over the face, lights out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure panic flooded her eyes as history repeated itself. Her head went fuzzy, then everything went black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the hospital, the operating room doors finally swung open. Julian was wheeled out on a gurney, still unconscious from the procedure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor removed his mask and addressed Daniel, who had been waiting outsid</span><span>e </span><span>the entire time. </span><span>"We got his leg fixed up. The surgery went well. He just needs proper rest now, but remember, absolutely no getting out of bed for at least a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel nodded and wheeled Julian into </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>ward</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Julian woke up. The first thing he did was to </span><span>check on</span><span> Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Aurora doing?" he </span><span>ask</span><span>ed weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Hawke," Daniel reassured him. "Ms. </span><span>Elvador's</span><span> kidney transplant was completely successful. Since it was her original kidney, there won't be any rejection issues. With proper care, she'll recover quickly, possibly even faster than your leg will heal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this news, a smile spread across Julian's pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's wonderful. With her kidney back, Aurora's health will improve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once her health improved, she might stop feeling guilty about being a burden to him. Maybe then she wouldn't want to leave him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, her leg and ear would require treatment from the world's top specialists. Whatever the cost, he was determined to get her the help she needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he asked about Bertha, "What </span><span>about</span><span> Bertha?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel let out a cold laugh, his voice tinged with contempt. "She's dead." He stated flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dead?" Julian </span><span>froze for a while</span><span>. "She just had one kidney removed and died that easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's death wasn't simply from losing a kidney. During the landslide, she had been struck by falling rocks. Her entire lower body was trapped beneath a massive boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was the insane pain, but somehow, right before the end, the half-crazy woman snapped back to reality. Her survival instinct went into overdrive as she begged Daniel to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, </span><span>help</span><span> me! I don't want to die! Please!" she had begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that critical moment, Daniel was focused solely on rescuing Aurora and Julian. He completely ignored Bertha's pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay face-down on the ground, frantically clawing at the earth. All ten fingernails had broken off, leaving her hands a bloody, mangled mess. It was a horrific sight to witness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all her efforts, she couldn't free herself from under the boulder. Her life slowly ebbed away in absolute desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, she and Aurora were rushed into surgery at the same time. Already barely clinging to life, Bertha died after the kidney removal procedure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Daniel's rundown, Julian's face stayed stone cold. Bertha had dug her own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine here," Julian said. "Go make sure Aurora's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel nodded and bounced, heading straight for Aurora's room. But when he found it empty, his heart stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She just got out of surgery! She can't even get out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is she missing?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bolted down the hallway, frantically searching for any medical staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's face went white as a sheet when they found the empty room. "This isn't possible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pulled up the security tapes, and there it was</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Aurora being pushed out in a wheelchair by some thick-set woman in stolen scrubs, playing nurse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora finally came to, pain ripping through her like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drugs were gone, and her kidney ached like someone was going ham with a hot poker. The pain was so brutal that she broke out in cold sweats instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes cracked open to pitch black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then whoosh&mdash;someone ripped off what turned out to be a huge black tarp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Cynthia, rocking that bitchy smirk. Pure "I won" energy coming off her. "How's that kennel treating you, Aurora?" she sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She strutted around Aurora like she owned the place. "Look at you now - Hawke Group CEO's trophy wife, chilling in a dog cage. Fucking priceless!"</span></p></div>
