        <h1>Chapter 179 They Will Pay Dearly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian appeared in the doorway, cutting an imposing figure in his tailored black suit. The moment he saw Aurora's disheveled state, his deep eyes blazed with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian strode across the room and delivered a precise kick that sent Gavin&mdash;who had been roughly gripping Aurora&mdash;sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's bulky frame crashed to the floor with a dull thud, and he let out a yelp of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paying no mind to the cream smeared across Aurora's clothes, Julian gathered her protectively into his arms, his hand moving in gentle circles across her back. She clung to the edge of his jacket like a lifeline, pressing herself against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room froze the instant Julian appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's presence was overpowering. His perfectly tailored black suit highlighted his tall, commanding stature, while his sharp features&mdash;high cheekbones, a prominent nose, and tightly pressed lips&mdash;exuded an air of authority that left the entire crowd speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a long moment, no one dared to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they snapped out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell do you think you are?" someone shouted. "You can't just hit our classmate unless you've got a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking all fancy in that suit doesn't mean shit," another chimed in. "Do you even know where you are? This is a super VIP suite at Grand Hotel. James is basically the Hawke Group CEO's favorite. Mess with us, and you're basically declaring war on Mr. Hawke himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman pushed her way forward. "Hey handsome, are you friends with Aurora? That girl is absolute trash&mdash;she stole someone else's boyfriend and did time in prison. You're too good to hang around someone as bad news as her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept going, voices overlapping as everyone tried to get a word in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, James stood to the side, the smug look completely wiped from his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared in disbelief at Aurora nestled in Julian's protective embrace, his mind completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to say something, but the crowd's noise drowned him out. All he could do was stand there, his gaze darting nervously around the room as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's ice-cold stare swept across everyone present. Wherever his gaze landed, people couldn't help but shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Julian's gaze settled on James. "</span><span>So</span><span> you're the James everyone's talking about?" he asked, his voice deep and arctic cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinking feeling spread through James' gut as his knees went weak. Still, he managed to plaster a desperate smile across his face. "Y-yes, that's me. Mr. Hawke, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes could have frozen hell itself. "I reserved this VIP room. Why do you think I'm here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked at each other in disbelief, their smug faces dropping into shock before pure fear took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> this handsome guy in the expensive suit is actually the CEO of Hawke Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And the way he's holding Aurora so protectively...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait, could he really be her fianc&eacute;?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the men transformed instantly. Their postures shifted as they bent forward slightly, eyes now filled with respect and faces plastered with fake smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women, meanwhile, couldn't tear their eyes off Julian. Their gazes glittered with naked ambition as they mentally calculated how they might connect with this wealthy man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia couldn't look away from Julian for even a second. She'd completely dropped her nasty attitude from earlier and was now trying her hardest to look sweet and approachable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke," she smiled, flipping her hair with practiced ease. "That woman in your arms was coming onto James. We were just putting her in her place for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't even bother </span><span>glancing at her</span><span>&mdash;like she wasn't even worth acknowledging. His eyes stayed locked on James as he continued his interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reserved this room for my friend's birthday," he growled. "Who the hell gave you permission to crash? And who had the balls to mess with the cake I ordered?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James was trembling like a leaf. "Mr. Hawke, I swear to God, I didn't know this was your reservation," he stuttered. "I wouldn't have set foot in here if I'd known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all their fault!" James squealed, throwing his classmates under the bus. "I only showed up </span><span>'cause</span><span> they were partying in 101!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His classmates' loyalty evaporated </span><span>real</span><span> quick when they saw him playing that card. No way in hell were they </span><span>gonna</span><span> take the fall - not with Hawke Group's CEO breathing down their necks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, hold up! We're not taking the heat for this," one of them spat out. "James, you straight-up told us to hit up 101."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's total BS! I said 107, you idiots went to the wrong damn room. How's that on me?" James fired back, sweating bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one throwing Mr. Hawke's name around to impress people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian couldn't be bothered watching their little dog fight. "James, the sales manager, right?" he said coldly. "You're fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James' eyes bulged like saucers. "Mr. Hawke,</span><span> </span><span>no!" he begged, his voice cracking. "I swear I didn't mean it. Please give me another chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give you a chance?" Julian's voice cut through the air. "Did any of you give my fianc&eacute;e a chance to explain herself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went dead silent as everyone's faces flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian turned to Daniel, who stood behind him. "Spread the word&mdash;any company that partners with Hawke Group is banned from hiring James. Anyone who dares employ him is declaring themselves my enemy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James trembled, knowing he was completely screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to the Grand Hotel manager, Julian added, "Since they love cake so much, </span><span>m</span><span>ake sure they get their fill. Order a five-tier cake for each of them. They'll stay at Grand Hotel for a month eating cake. No one leaves until they finish every last bite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julian scooped Aurora into his arms and strode out, leaving the group behind him literally shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the cake tasted amazing, but being forced to eat a massive five-tiered one every day for a month was basically a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention how the calories would pile on&mdash;nobody wanted to imagine how fat they'd get after that punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had barely reached the hotel entrance with Aurora in his arms when they ran straight into Ethan and Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart jumped to her throat when she saw Aurora's disheveled state. "What the hell happened to her?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, her eyes red and puffy, quickly explained everything that had gone down in the VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's fists clenched instantly.</span><br><span>Does Aurora have some kind of trash-magnet quality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How does she keep running into these absolute garbage humans wherever she goes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Hawke's punishment is way too soft for </span><span>them</span><span>. I need to handle this myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll make sure they never forget it</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flashed in Lily's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan frowned. He'd seen Lily's methods before. It was bloody and brutal&mdash;the kind that crossed the line into criminal territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snagged her arm, shaking his head with a clear "don't even think about it" look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily just ripped her arm away and stomped toward the room like a woman on a mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butterfly knife danced between Lily's fingers, its steel glinting coldly in the light as it spun, reflecting her </span><span>icy </span><span>expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel manager had already set out all the cake as instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Eat!" Lily's voice cut through the room, emotionless as a winter wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James looked absolutely miserable as his trembling fingers broke off a huge chunk of cake and stuffed it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cheeks puffed out like a bullfrog as he struggled to chew, then started gagging almost immediately. He made awful gurgling sounds in his throat while his eyes, full of pain and silent pleading, looked toward Lily&mdash;only to be met with an even colder stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could recover, Lily kicked him hard in the leg, sending him crashing to his knees with a loud thud. The cake fell from his hands onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick it up and eat it!" Lily pressed the butterfly knife against his neck, drawing a thin line of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James didn't dare disobey. With trembling hands, he picked up the cake from the floor, now lightly dusted with dirt, and forced it down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia never would have guessed that these two bitches&mdash;Lily and Aurora&mdash;were actually friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily </span><span>stole </span><span>her boyfriend Samuel, and now Aurora snatched away Julian, her next target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">These </span><span style="font-style: italic;">two </span><span style="font-style: italic;">shameless sluts </span><span style="font-style: italic;">are</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the bane of </span><span style="font-style: italic;">my </span><span style="font-style: italic;">existence</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Cynthia stared at the mountain of cake in front of her, her stomach churned violently. She reluctantly took a tiny bite, and the sickening sweetness instantly overwhelmed her, setting off her gag reflex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh&mdash;" She couldn't help retching, but the moment she started to spit it out, she caught Lily's knife-sharp glare cutting in her direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've warned you before. Now, eat everything you spit out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia sobbed in despair as she scooped up her own vomit with trembling hands and stuffed it back into her mouth. Her lips were smeared with puke and cake crumbs, making her look absolutely pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin and Stella had gone ghostly pale. Their stomachs were stretched like balloons, and every bite of cake they swallowed felt like it might tear their guts open.</span></p></div>
