        <h1>Chapter 246 Epilogue: Aurora XL</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not yet accustomed to high heels, Lily lost her balance and fell backward after being jostled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a large hand encircled her lithe waist, drawing her into a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes widened in shock. Gazing up at Ethan, she realized that he was the same man who'd taken her to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, he found himself drawn to her, and his grip around her waist tightened instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the pressure on her waist, she snapped out of her daze and shoved him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"T-thank you," she stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span> smiled, "Let's go. The wedding is about to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily arrived just at the opportune moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora beamed at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily grinned from ear to ear, feeling as if she were floating in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she was a child, Aurora had been her idol and the goal of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By entering the same university as Aurora and joining the Science and Technology Research Institute where her idol worked, Lily had formed a much deeper connection with her. Moreover, she </span><span>was now </span><span>attending Aurora's wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily believed that Aurora was the one who had brought good luck into her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Aurora came along, she was just another basic girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the second she spotted Aurora on TV, everything clicked. Like someone flipped a switch in her brain and suddenly her whole future made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily murmured, "Aurora, happy wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gently stroked Lily's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How wonderful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In this lifetime, Lily's happy and carefree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She won't get hurt because of me anymore, nor will she be driven by my misfortune to become a murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, later I'll throw the bouquet at you. You must catch it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hoped to share her bliss with Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, Lily had spared no effort to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, she, in turn, would not hesitate to safeguard Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Lily nodded energetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Aurora looking like a whole snack in her wedding dress, all happy and stuff, got her feeling some type of way. Like she might cry, but in a good way&mdash;like everything was finally right with the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora pouted and grumbled, "Aurora, you're being too partial. I'm not married yet either. Why don't you throw the bouquet at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora just smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was different though. Daisy and Lily were closer than family to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the emcee exclaimed, "Let's welcome the bride and groom," the doors of the hall slowly opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the watchful eyes of numerous celebrities and prominent figures, Aurora and Julian pledged their love and commitment to each other for a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged rings, hugged, and kissed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, everything was incredibly beautiful and progressed seamlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan sat in his seat, staring intently at Lily all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but pick up his phone and record her every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant she caught the bouquet, her smile was so radiant that she seemed to be glowing with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily wasn't the most beautiful woman, but she had a fatal attraction for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding was truly magnificent. Everyone was overjoyed and indulged in a great deal of wine, creating a lively and festive atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lily's first time drinking. Her cheeks were </span><span>all </span><span>flushed</span><span> after </span><span>several</span><span> drinks</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stumbled towards the restroom, her body swaying, on the brink of falling at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The high heels are killing my feet," </span><span>she</span><span> mumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she kicked off her heels angrily and walked barefoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan shook his head in a light mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crouched down, picked up Lily's heels, and tried to put them on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she was so dizzy that the man before her was </span><span>just </span><span>a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't </span><span>need</span><span> them</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span> she protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll catch a chill and fall ill if you go barefoot," Ethan coaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily just refused. "No way. The heels hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan </span><span>sighed</span><span>, "Are you really not going to wear them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Definitely n</span><span>o."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan cast a deep glance at her and rose to his feet. Clutching her high heels in one hand, he effortlessly swept her up into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily straight up wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed up against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was the booze making her all warm and red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Face against his chest, she couldn't get enough of how cool his body felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You feel so good. I love it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tilted her head up and rubbed her rosy cheeks against Ethan's well-defined, handsome visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her scarlet lips grazed his, and instantly, his eyes narrowed while his body tensed like a coiled spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse. "Lily, be good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily didn't register Ethan's words in the slightest. Even if she had, her alcohol-addled brain was in no condition to make sense of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wriggled against him nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span> took a deep breath. "How reckless you are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, it was me. Otherwise, you might have been bullied by someone with ill intentions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about some other guy trying to get at Lily had him ready to throw hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't figure out why he was acting all possessive over a girl he met one time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, if some random woman tried coming at him, he would've curved her quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, here he was playing driver, holding her umbrella, and getting all close with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan glanced down at Lily. She curled up in his arms, as docile as a lazy kitten, utterly vulnerable and defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You</span><span> did this</span><span>, so don't deny it when you sober up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan carried Lily to the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully laid her on the bed. Yet, her hands, firmly clasped around his neck, suddenly tugged him down, making him fall on top of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their noses touched, and in that intimate proximity, he could make out every detail of her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gulped nervously and summoned every ounce of self-control to compose himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he</span><span> took Lily's hands off his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and was about to leave, but an idea </span><span>just </span><span>flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have to do something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Otherwise, she will just ghost me after she wakes up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan pondered for a bit, and a smile spread across his face as an inspiration struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shrugged off his suit jacket and flung it to the floor. Then, with a forceful motion, he ripped open the collar of his white shirt, causing two buttons to pop off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still not satisfied, he ruffled his hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he resembled an innocent guy, unwillingly falling victim to flirting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan put his tie in Lily's hand and then lay prone beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time, the effect of the alcohol on </span><span>Lily</span><span> gradually wore off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly got up and had a terrible headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon catching sight of Ethan, she let out a startled cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan feigned being roused from his slumber. He lifted his head, still looking drowsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily frowned tightly. "What did you do to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan found it a bit amusing but put on a frustrated expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you ask </span><span>that</span><span>? </span><span>Look, </span><span>I'm the victim</span><span> here</span><span>," he point</span><span>ed</span><span> at himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked Ethan up and down. Each second that passed made her more freaked out, and her face went bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a total mess&mdash;hair all messed up, shirt ripped open showing his chest, looking like someone had jumped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even worse, she was still holding his tie in a death grip, keeping him from getting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything pointed to her being the guilty one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The booze must've made me lose it and jump his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why else would there be lipstick all over his face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was screaming inside, wanting to crawl into a hole and die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no clue that the same tricks she'd used on Ethan in her past life, he was now using on her in this one.</span></p></div>
