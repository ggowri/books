        <h1>Chapter 146 DNA Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The development of the situation far exceeded Isabella's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she had eagerly gone to the</span><span> country jail</span><span>, hoping that Joshua would bring good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that as long as Joshua could convince Julian to let Bertha go, she would be able to joyfully bring Bertha back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of receiving a call from Joshua, Isabella was met by Julian's personal assistant, Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span> </span><span>bailed </span><span>both </span><span>Bertha and Adolph out of the county jail</span><span>, </span><span>and Isabella happily thought that Joshua had convinced Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them then followed Ethan to the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>t that moment</span><span>, </span><span>Isabella belatedly realized that everything had been carefully planned by Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purpose was to gather them all together and publicly expose everything that had happened all those years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's heart pounded in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was a ticking time bomb, and she knew the second it was confirmed that Bertha and their son weren't Joshua's, their entire family would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isabella wasn't the type of woman to crumble under pressure. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how chaotic her thoughts were, she kept her composure, her expression betraying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a natural expression, she took the document from Joshua's hand and casually flipped through it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, suddenly, she let out a soft laugh, before tossing the document carelessly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joshua, do you </span><span>trust</span><span> me, or do you </span><span>trust</span><span> Aurora?" Isabella asked softly, locking her gaze onto Joshua.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, whose face was filled with anger and on the brink of exploding, was stunned by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Isabella. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, he saw sincerity and what seemed like an unwavering love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head helplessly, Isabella sighed, "Come on, haven't you figured it out yet? This whole thing is a trap set by Aurora and the Hawke family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora hates us. She resents Bertha for ruining her life. That's why she forged these documents&mdash;to drive a wedge between us. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can</span><span>'</span><span>t be deceived by this. If we turn against each other, it will play right into Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All these years, you know better than anyone how I feel about you. If I didn't love you, why would I still be single? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm</span><span> now the head</span><span> of Orley Central Hospital, and countless successful men have pursued me, </span><span>e</span><span>ven young men in their twenties were lining up, hoping I'd take them in. But I never once wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn</span><span>'</span><span>t this prove how sincere my feelings for you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was undeniable that Isabella</span><span>'</span><span>s quick thinking and eloquence were extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have been able to win Joshua over in just half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached for Joshua's hands, holding them gently, her eyes filled with warmth as she continued, "Joshua, I fell for you at first sight, and all these years, my heart has only belonged to you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though your health isn</span><span>'</span><span>t what it used to be, I</span><span>'</span><span>ve never thought of leaving you. I truly want to spend my life with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua looked at Isabella's beautiful face, listening to her gentle words, and all his doubts vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his anger faded, the tension in his body relaxed, and only then did he feel the sharp pain in his legs, reminding him that his broken bones hadn't fully healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swayed, and Isabella immediately supported him, helping him into a wheelchair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt her concern for him and gently patted her hand, comforting, "Isabella, I </span><span>trust</span><span> you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing those words, Isabella</span><span>'</span><span>s heart finally settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a fool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Only a woman like Celeste, who was obsessed with love, could be so easily deceived by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it weren</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t for Celeste being born into a rich family and having a father who adored her, she would have been used and discarded long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It was her fault for being so naive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whoever was born as her child was just unlucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s miserable life was all because of Celeste</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s foolishness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Isabella subtly gave Frank a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Joshua dispel all doubts, Frank couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but smile slightly, an almost imperceptible smile forming on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, now looking at Aurora with a look of extreme disgust, coldly laughed,"Trying to drive a wedge between me and Isabella with this little stunt, huh? You've got the wrong guy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I</span><span>'</span><span>ve been in business for nearly thirty years. Your little tricks don</span><span>'</span><span>t even register in my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are a Jerome through and through&mdash;vile to the core. That arrogant face of yours makes me sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua thought Aurora would be embarrassed and ashamed by his humiliating words, but instead, she was looking at him with pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes seemed to look at him as though he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stand that kind of look, as though he were worthless, something beneath her notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came from a poor mountain village, and his family was the poorest in that village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that small village, anyone could bully him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had had enough of people looking down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua</span><span>'</span><span>s expression twisted into a snarl. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "What</span><span>'</span><span>s with that look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered, "Joshua, you really are beyond redemption. The evidence is right in front of you, but you refuse to see it, blindly trusting Isabella</span><span>'</span><span>s one-sided story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don</span><span>'</span><span>t believe the information on the document? Your eyes can</span><span>'</span><span>t be that blind, can they? Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you see how Bertha looks nothing like you, but resembles your driver perfectly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, all eyes in the room turned to Frank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank, being just a driver who usually tried to stay out of the spotlight, was rarely noticed by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Aurora's reminder, everyone realized that Bertha's nose and mouth were strikingly similar to Frank</span><span>'</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isabella who reacted first, quickly saying, "People always say nephews take after their uncles. What's so strange about Bertha looking like her own uncle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua let out a slow breath, his tension easing&mdash;only to scoff the next second, "Funny how the guilty always think everyone else is just as rotten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s mocking smile deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that</span><span>'</span><span>s the case, let</span><span>'</span><span>s do a DNA test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those words left her mouth, it felt like a spell had been cast, freezing Isabella, Bertha, and Frank in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fixed her gaze on Joshua and said, "You're so sure Bertha is your biological daughter, right? Then why don't you take a DNA test with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Joshua's hands clenched tightly around the armrests of his wheelchair, turning his knuckles white. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen, but he said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What</span><span>'</span><span>s wrong? Are you afraid?" Aurora continued to mock him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or how about we do a test between Bertha and Frank?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's heart sank instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was too confident, so confident that it terrified him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was proven that Bertha wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t his daughter, all his actions over the years&mdash;hurting his wife, son, and daughter for Bertha&mdash;would become a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t that he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to do the test; he simply couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t bring himself to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Julian finally spoke up, "Dr. Lowell is here. Ethan, go pull some hair samples from Joshua, Bertha, and Frank and give them to Dr. Lowell." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, Ethan stepped forward immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank's heart sank.</span><br><span>If the truth </span><span>i</span><span>s exposed, the three of us will never make it out of Hawke Estate unscathed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, no... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to grab Isabella and Bertha and get the hell out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, he clenched his fist and swung it at Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before his fist could land, Ethan grabbed it, twisting Frank</span><span>'</span><span>s arm with such force that Frank was brought to his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, Frank</span><span>'</span><span>s shoulder dislocated, and he screamed in agony, instantly losing the ability to resist.</span></p></div>
