        <h1>Chapter 208 Aurora's Epilogue II</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stole a glance at Hannah, whose face had suddenly turned serious. "Come on! Aurora's always been a well-behaved and sensible girl. There's no way she'd go around hitting you. If she did, you must've started it. Now, say sorry to Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart did a little flip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words rang a bell; she'd heard them a million times before, but back then, it was the Elvador family standing up for Bertha, not her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua, Celeste, and Barnett would chew her out like she was the bad guy and make her apologize to the real troublemaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, having someone stick up for her felt like a dream&mdash;a total 180.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally dawned on her why Bertha always acted so high and mighty. Being defended like that must feel like a million bucks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Kaur, I'm bleeding like a stuck pig from my nose! Why are you taking Aurora's side?" Hubery whined, pulling up his shirt to show a bruise on his belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! She not only clobbered my nose with that basketball but also gave me a kick in the gut! You can't just let her get away with it because she's smart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah frowned disapprovingly. "Hubery, you're always stirring up trouble! I bet you did something to set Aurora off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned to Aurora, and her face softened. "Aurora, honey, tell me&mdash;did Hubery pick on you first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five-year-old Aurora looked up at her, blinking those big, innocent eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chubby cheeks puffed out so adorably as she showed her tear-streaked face, all pure and unmarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible not to feel a pang of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't be scared. If Hubery was giving you a hard time, you can count on me to sort it out," Hannah soothed her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded, her face jiggling cutely, which just added to her charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Kaur, he whacked me with the basketball and started ordering me around, saying I had to go get it for him. He said if I didn't, he'd hit me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he called me a dumb nerd, said all my studying was a waste of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Hannah with those big, puppy-dog eyes, playing the innocent card. "Ms. Kaur, is he right? Is studying really no good? Maybe I should just mess around like them every day instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was clearly goading Hubery with her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Hubery had turned out to be a totally ungrateful little punk. After she'd busted her butt to pay for his college, he'd started showing off his new-found cash, splurging on designer stuff and throwing money around like it was nothing. And on top of that, he'd helped Bertha frame Aurora, which landed her in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, Aurora figured it'd be sweet to let him feel what it's like to be on the receiving end of injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was seething. As she took in what Aurora had said, her face went all sorts of colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just about a smart little girl; Aurora was a ray of hope, a future star that the country was crying out for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was only five and already gearing up for the SAT. A prodigy like her needed to be nurtured, not held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was so clueless. Not only was he picking on her, but he was also telling her to ditch her studies and just mess around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a disservice to the nation's talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had half a mind to give Hubery a good slap, but with the grown-ups around, she held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, her voice turned ice-cold as she scolded him, "Hubery, who do you think you are, telling Aurora to slack off on her studies? You're always causing a ruckus yourself, and now you're trying to tell her what to do? At your age, you ought to have more sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's eyes welled up with tears after Hannah's scolding. He shook his head like crazy, protesting, "Ms. Kaur, I didn't do jack! She's pulling your leg!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah crossed her arms and shot back sharply, "After you messed things up, instead of manning up, you're trying to pin it on Aurora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Ms. Kaur, you have to believe me! I swear I never said a word to make her stop studying! It's all Aurora's baloney. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut it out!" Hannah pointed at Hubery, looking utterly disappointed. "Aurora's always been a well-behaved and respectful kid. She'd never stir up trouble or tell fibs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, still just a little kid, felt a huge sense of injustice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down his cheeks as he wailed, "Wahhh... Ms. Kaur, you have to trust me! I'm not lying! I never told her to quit studying, I swear..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much he bawled, Hannah wasn't gonna change her tune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him blubbering, Hannah frowned. "How can you even cry like a baby? Look at how calm Aurora is! You whacked her on the head, and she didn't say a peep, but here you are acting like the poor victim."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery bit his lip, too deflated to argue back. Tears of frustration still rolled down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of him being so wrongly accused gave Aurora a strange sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, Hubery, you don't like being wrongly accused either, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, the woman, who had been quietly watching from the sidelines, bent down to look Aurora in the eye. "Hey, sweetie. You must be Aurora, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up at her, instantly drawn in by the woman's lovely perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This family of three was dressed to the nines in custom-made clothes, clearly from money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wide-eyed innocence, Aurora asked, "Pretty lady, do you know me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman beamed even wider at the compliment. She gently ruffled Aurora's hair and said, "Oh, you little whiz! Not only do I know you, but half of Peloland probably does too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora squinted her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her age, aside from reading, she had no access to the internet or the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow, I had no idea I'd become such a big deal. If the Elvador family finds out I'm one of them, they might take me back early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked at her tenderly and said, "Aurora, I'd love to adopt you. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her head, Aurora thought.</span><br><span>In my past life, they didn't recognize my smarts, but they still wanted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, they're still so keen on adopting me this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I turned them down last time, but this time, I must grab this chance with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Extending her chubby little hand, she grasped the woman's. "I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her sentence, Hubery interrupted, "You can't adopt her! She's just a little liar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, what are you talking about?" Hannah snapped, exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The couple had promised to donate a million dollars to the orphanage&mdash;not someone to provoke lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had been going smoothly, but she never expected Hubery to suddenly pop up and mess things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not lying! Aurora's the real liar here! Just now, I never told her not to study. But she went and accused me of it! She's only five, and already she's telling fibs. When she grows up, she'll be no good. For all we know, she might even turn into a cold-blooded killer and end up behind bars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubery, you better zip it! That's enough!" Hannah was fuming, raising her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden from prying eyes, Aurora gave herself a fierce pinch. Immediately, tears welled up and spilled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd never hurt a fly! I'm not a criminal! Waaaaah..." she whimpered quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stigma of being a former inmate from her past life still stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, Aurora was damned if she'd let anyone smear her reputation again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was just a five-year-old kid, and this innocent act was her best cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, good students, especially a recognized prodigy like her, always got the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as Aurora started blubbering, Hannah's heart went out to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Aurora had shown off her smarts at just one-year-old, Hannah had taken a shine to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past four years, Hannah had doted on Aurora like her own flesh and blood, and Aurora had never disappointed&mdash;graduating from high school at such a tender age, she'd brought glory to the whole orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora's tears streamed down, Hannah's heart ached worse than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fed up to the back teeth with the mess, she lashed out and smacked Hubery across the face. "You're just a snot-nosed kid, and here you are talking a load of rubbish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows what a sorry state you'll end up in when you grow up! Get someone to haul Hubery off and teach him some manners!" Hannah barked, her voice brooking no argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hubery was dragged away, a wave of relief washed over Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she'd finally given him a dose of his own medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to see how Hubery would make it as a lawyer without her help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head in helplessness, Hannah turned to the couple. "Mr. Barron, Mrs. Barron, I'm really sorry you had to see this. Aurora's a fantastic, sharp-witted kid, and she's always been the pride of our orphanage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe with the right kind of backing, Aurora'll turn into one of the great talents for the country."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin Barron and Laura Barron were quite satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura then turned to Aurora, her eyes going all soft. "Aurora, how about coming home with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bobbed her head up and down like crazy, her face lighting up like a Christmas tree. "I'd love to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meet your brother, William Barron," Laura said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora swiveled around to face William. Her big eyes were twinkling as she cooed, "Brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, who was ten years old, mostly kept a poker face, looking like a mini grown-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Aurora called him "brother" in that cute voice, his cheeks went as red as a beet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister," he managed to say, trying to keep his cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora raised an eyebrow. It was just too cute seeing this little hunk getting all shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out for his small hand, and his face went even redder. But William still kept that serious look on, which just made him even more appealing to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Benjamin and Laura wrapped up the adoption paperwork, Aurora hopped into their car, a jumble of excitement and nerves churning inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drive was quiet, and she was on her best behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they drove out of Orley, her curiosity got the better of her. "Mom, Dad, where are we headed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the front passenger seat, Laura twisted around with a loving smile. "Sweetie, our home isn't in Orley. We're making our way back to our place in Putnam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of "Putnam", Aurora's eyes popped wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Putnam?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't that the city where Julian lives? I might just get a shot at seeing him again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Julian stirred up a whole mess of feelings in her&mdash;happiness all tangled up with a bit of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder how he's been since I... since I kicked the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she gnawed on her lip, a flood of emotions hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared out the window, watching the streets of Orley fade away, replaced by vast fields and the guardrails along the highway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, noticing she was deep in thought, leaned over a bit and asked in a soft voice, "Aurora, what's up? You okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice had that kid-like innocence, a sharp contrast to his serious look. And even though he was a bit clumsy about it, you could tell he was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of her daydream, Aurora turned to William with a sweet smile. "I'm good, William! I was just itching to know about going to Putnam. It's my first time in Joliffe, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In both her past life and this one, it really was her first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, William reached out and gently ruffled her hair, trying his best to sound all grown-up. "Putnam's a real good place! I'll take you around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a warm glow spread through her heart. The family love she'd yearned for in her past life seemed to start filling that empty spot right then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey from Orley to Putnam would take a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, being so small, wasn't used to long rides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after about an hour, she started to feel wiped out. Aurora's eyelids started to droop as she gradually dozed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, when the car smoothly pulled into Putnam, she felt someone's arms wrapping around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waking up from her sleep, she suddenly opened her eyes and saw Benjamin's large, good-looking face right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you're awake?" he asked, gently getting ready to pick her up. His actions were so gentle, trying not to wake her up, but well, Aurora was wide awake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin felt a twinge of disappointment.</span><br><span>Why does she wake up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My little girl looks like a cute, squishy cake. I wish I could just hold her. Imagine how snug it'd be, not like that stubborn boy who's such a bore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His desire to get close to his dear daughter was dashed when Aurora, being so considerate, reached out her little hand to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I can walk on my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she jumped out of the car, tilted her little face up at Benjamin, and gave him a big, proud smile as if to say, "Look, Dad, I'm so good at this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin could only let out a soft chuckle. "Wow, our Aurora is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took her left hand while Laura grabbed her right, and the three of them, just like a happy little family, walked towards the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, William lagged behind, his face gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Aurora whipped her head around and called out, "William, come on, speed it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyes sparkled. Even though he'd been keeping his lips zipped, a faint smile managed to sneak onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">See? I knew she wouldn't leave me in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mom and Dad were right&mdash;my sis is just the cutest! I'm head-over-heels for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they stepped into the house, Aurora's jaw dropped. The Barron family was even richer than she'd ever dreamed. The villa was decked out with class, a perfect mix of understated luxury and a warm, grand vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sofas in the living room were worth a small fortune!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was just the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole villa was done up with rare solid wood, and the renovation alone cost well over 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What on earth have I missed in her past life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Aurora was lost in these musings, Laura took her upstairs and showed her to a room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the door swung open, a room straight out of a princess' dream, all decked out in pink, came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bright sunlight streamed in, bathing the room in a cozy, golden glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura asked, "Aurora, this here's your very own special room. Do you dig it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The princess-themed room, about 300 square feet, was roomy and flooded with sunshine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora took in the sight, she couldn't help but recall the first time she'd gone back to the Elvador family. They hadn't even bothered to fix up a room for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she'd picked the first room, Barnett had said it'd be turned into a study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the second one? He'd decided it'd become Bertha's practice room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she'd gone for the attic, but Barnett had said it was too shabby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, they'd just dumped her in a gloomy, damp storage room without any windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Aurora stood in front of this beautifully-decorated princess room, tears welled up in her eyes and started streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Laura got all flustered. "Aurora, what's the matter? Why're you crying? Don't you like the room? If not, we'll keep changing it till you're tickled pink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head like crazy. "No! I love it! I've never had a room this gorgeous before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, overcome with gratitude, she leaped up and wrapped her little arms around Laura's neck. "Thanks, Mom!"</span></p></div>
