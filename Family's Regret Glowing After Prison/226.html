        <h1>Chapter 226 Epilogue: Aurora XX</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste grabbed a rock from the ground. With cold precision, she hurled it at Joshua's face, aiming straight for his eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his scream was a bloodcurdling howl that echoed through the barren space. Within seconds, crimson liquid began to seep from the wound, dripping down his cheek in rivulets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste rose to her feet, towering over him as he writhed on the ground, clutching his injured eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their past life, Joshua had blinded one of her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because they were married, society dismissed it as nothing more than a trivial spat between spouses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this lifetime, she would repay him in kind. After all, if he could get away with blinding her, why couldn't she do the same?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her foot and pressed it firmly onto his head, grinding down without mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you now, rolling around like some pathetic dog," she mocked, her voice dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone sharpened, venom lacing every word. "No, wait. You're worse than a dog. Even dogs know to wag their tails when I'm near. You're so ungrateful that you never learn loyalty."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua felt like his skull might cave under the pressure of her heel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in his wildest nightmares had he imagined Celeste capable of such ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart pounded wildly in fear. Overwhelmed by the sheer brutality of it all, his body gave out, and he slipped into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Celeste wasn't about to let him off so easily. The hatred festering inside her ran deeper than death. It couldn't be erased by simply killing him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ruthless efficiency, she dragged his limp body like a sack of garbage, hauling him back toward their run-down rental apartment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally arrived, voices spilled from within the cramped walls.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat slowly, Bertha. All of this is yours."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Barnett! You're so much nicer to me than Mom is. She yells at me and hits me. I don't want her as my mom anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, be good. Mom doesn't mean it. She's just stressed. Once she calms down, she'll go back to loving you like before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll never forgive her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door flew open with enough force to rattle the hinges. Standing there, chest heaving, was Celeste, her presence electrifying the room. Both Barnett and Bertha jumped in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glanced at Celeste, and for a fleeting instant, he quickly masked his guilt. </span><br><span>Mom has lavished love on Bertha for years. The fact that Bertha is the daughter of Daddy's mistress can't eclipse the irrefutable reality that Mom has raised Bertha with unconditional devotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Celeste would be so heartless as to just cast Bertha aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Bertha was such a sweet and adorable girl that he loved her deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, he said, "Mom, you're back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shot him an intense glare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've told him the truth about Bertha. Surely, armed with this knowledge, he should sever ties with the brat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yet here he is, not only inviting Bertha into our home but also devouring the snacks meant for Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by deliberate step, Celeste moved closer to her son.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flickered across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, wh-what's wrong?" he stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, she raised her hand and struck him with full force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap resounded like thunder, sending him sprawling to the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vivid red handprint bloomed across his cheek, swelling almost instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know exactly what Bertha is. A bastard child!" Celeste yelled. "And yet you coddle her while ignoring your own sister. When have you ever shown such care for Aurora?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stared up at her, wide-eyed and trembling. He had never seen this side of his mother before. He was still just a kid, after all. Terrified, tears streamed down his face as he struggled to find words, but none came.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her icy glare shifted to Bertha, who shrank back visibly, shaking like a leaf.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"M-mom..." Bertha stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Celeste snapped. "You're not my daughter. A slut's spawn like you has no right to call me 'Mom.'</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you the one who's always raving about how much you love this stuff? Aren't you the one who always has to swoop in and snatch whatever Aurora wants? Fine. Today, I'm gonna let you have all you can handle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She strode forward, grabbing Bertha by the collar and yanking her close. Then, with brutal determination, she scooped up the remaining pastries and shoved them forcefully into the girl's mouth, one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat!" she barked. "I said, eat! If you don't finish every single bite, I'll beat you until you choke on it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's cheeks bulged painfully as her mouth was stuffed. Her terrified eyes watered as she gagged repeatedly, desperate to vomit but unable to escape Celeste's iron grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agonizingly, she swallowed everything, even though it was five times more food than she had ever eaten in one sitting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she collapsed onto the floor, clutching her stomach and sobbing silently, too weak to make a sound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Barnett had regained his composure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you treat Bertha like this, Mom?" he yelled, his voice cracking with anguish. "It was Dad's mistake, not hers! She's innocent!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her to the hospital now. Can't you see she's suffering?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste glanced at him. "If you care so much about her, then take her back to her real mother."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm your biological son!" Barnett shouted, desperation creeping into his tone. "Why are you treating me like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he was her son. But Aurora was her daughter too, a daughter who had endured years of relentless abuse at the hands of her own parents and brother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight long years, including three years trapped in the Elvador Villa and five soul-crushing years behind bars, had left Aurora battered and scarred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All those responsible for her suffering deserved punishment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out," Celeste shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett clenched his jaw, fury blazing in his tear-filled eyes. "Mark my words, Mom. You'll regret being so heartless someday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great effort, he hoisted Bertha into his arms and staggered toward the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Joshua had regained consciousness, his single good eye blazing with hatred as he took in the sight of his battered children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "Celeste, you just wait. I'll repay the humiliation you've dealt me today tenfold, no, a hundredfold, in the future. You care so much about your precious biological daughter, don't you? I swear, I'll rip her up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that venomous promise burning in his eyes, Joshua led Barnett and Bertha away. The three of them staggered off together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stood frozen, watching as the trio limped away together. Not once did she flinch or attempt to stop them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed in silence. On the third day, it was time for Aurora to register at university.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura canceled all their appointments, determined to accompany their precious daughter on this momentous occasion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Laura clung tightly to Aurora, reluctantly being separated from Aurora. "Baby, you're still so young. Living alone on campus won't work at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, everyone else will be adults. It'll be inconvenient for you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, there's no way you're staying in the dorms. I've made up my mind. For all four years of college, I'm tagging along. I'll buy a place just outside campus, so you can come home every single day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin nodded in agreement. "That's right. Taking care of our daughter comes first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pouted dramatically. "Mom, transfer me to Aurora's school! I want to see her every day."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter filled the car.</span></p></div>
