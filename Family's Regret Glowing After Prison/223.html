        <h1>Chapter 223 Epilogue: Aurora XVII</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stumbled back to her room, collapsing onto the bed in a haze of despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "No</span><span> way</span><span>. I can't let the Barron family steal Aurora away from me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they showered Aurora with love now, Celeste remembered the past when their so-called love turned to neglect, leaving Aurora back in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had suffered enough in that lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, as her biological mother, Celeste swore she would never let history repeat itself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yes! I need to get Aurora back. She's still young and impressionable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can just show her love and build our bond, she'll eventually see how much I care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then it hit her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, the top scorer, would have a big college admission party thrown by the Barrons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be the perfect stage. Crowds of people, influential and curious, would gather in one place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste planned to step up and announce she was Aurora's real mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barrons, under all that public pressure, would have to give her daughter back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her plan set, Celeste's heart calmed, and she drifted into a restless sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The days flew by, getting closer to the start of the school year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days before the term began, the Barron family hosted a lavish college admission banquet for Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they didn't choose Celestia Palace as the venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the celebration unfolded within the grandeur of their estate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the banquet hall, guests mingled in clusters, their laughter and chatter filling the air with a festive buzz.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment Benjamin and Laura stepped forward, leading Aurora into the spotlight, a hush fell over the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to the girl at their side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, breathtaking in her elegance, commanded the room without effort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some gazes held adoration, others tenderness, and a few glinted with calculated curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just five years old, Aurora had already secured a place at the prestigious MIT.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a prodigy! Her future was </span><span>bright!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests, mostly savvy business folks already tight with the Barrons, saw Aurora as an even bigger reason to cozy up. She was a golden opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin faced the crowd, his smile radiant with pride. "Today is my daughter's..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, chaos erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stole my daughter and drove my family to bankruptcy! Shame on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious roar sliced through the room as Joshua stormed into the banquet hall, his face flushed with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, a swarm of security guards surged forward, ready to seize him and drag him out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joshua fought like a man possessed, his strength almost inhuman as he wrestled against their grip, refusing to be subdued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Aurora, glinting with a feral greed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unbelievable! Aurora, this little bastard, scores top honors in the entire state at just five years old?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's got my brains. My flesh and blood. Brilliant. A genius.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known this little brat was a child prodigy, he never would've dumped her at the orphanage all those years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A prodigy like Aurora could've brought unimaginable glory to the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was five years old, Aurora enrolled in MIT as the top scorer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The credentials stacked up like a towering monument, rendering her worth virtually priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a walking goldmine, her fame already rivaling that of A-list celebrities. Her name was splashed across headlines and trending online.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the Elvador family bankrupt and desperate, Joshua saw his ticket to a comeback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he had to do was reclaim Aurora and squeeze every ounce of worth from her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if, down the line, Isabella's kidney disease worsened, they could always harvest Aurora's kidney to save her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella had kidney disease, and what if Bertha inherited it too?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solution was to keep Aurora under his thumb as a living organ donor for Isabella and Bertha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these vile thoughts churning in his mind, Joshua had stormed into the banquet hall, heedless of the occasion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's big day? He couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selfish to the core, he only ever thought of himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking free from the security guards, Joshua fixed his gaze on Aurora, tears welling in his eyes as he painted the picture of a heartbroken father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He choked on a sob with feigned anguish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, my sweet girl, </span><span>I</span><span> finally f</span><span>ind</span><span> you! Do you have any idea how much my heart has ached since you were stolen by traffickers the day you were born?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mom was devastated. She couldn't eat or sleep. I had to adopt Bertha just to keep your mother from falling apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I never gave up on you, Aurora. For five years, I've searched high and low, and now, seeing you here, I'm just so happy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Joshua inched closer to Aurora, outstretching his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, honey, can I give you a hug? Please?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a master of deception, his sniffling and tear-streaked face fooling many of the unsuspecting guests.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, most of them only knew Aurora as the girl the Barron family had adopted from the orphanage in Orley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had assumed her biological parents had abandoned her, perhaps favoring a son over a daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this dramatic tale of traffickers and a grieving father turned their assumptions upside down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poor thing," one guest whispered. "So she wasn't abandoned. She was stolen by traffickers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, poor little thing," another agreed. "From the moment she took her first breath, her life was hijacked by cruelty."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, I think her biological parents are the real victims here. They waited nine whole months, hearts full of hope, only to have their precious daughter ripped away by those heartless traffickers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you imagine the agony? It'd shatter any parent's soul."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They should give her back," someone else cut in. "The Barron family have only had her for a month. The bond can't be that deep. Let her go back to her real family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, swept up in Joshua's performance, began to turn against the Barron family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even pulled out their phones, recording the spectacle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua watched the scene unfold, his heart swelling with joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The mighty Barron family has been brought to their knees by public opinion!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as these gullible fools believe my sob story, the Barron family will have no choice but to surrender Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate to revive his fallen family, Joshua was willing to do anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Benjamin and Laura, dropping to his knees with a dramatic thud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. and Mrs. Barron, I'm begging you! Give me back my daughter!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my everything. You might not know this, but my wife and I always dreamed of having a girl. I'm a total girl dad, through and through.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When my baby was stolen, I spiraled into depression. For five years, I've been on meds, barely hanging on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when I found out Aurora was my daughter, I stopped taking the pills. She's my cure and my reason to live.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, I'll do anything for you. Just give me back my little girl."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were sweeter than a love song, his acting so convincing he could've won an Oscar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd ate it up, completely deceived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora, who knew the depths of his cruelty, watched him with icy detachment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura, meanwhile, exchanged a knowing look. Their smiles looked sharp and unyielding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin sneered. "So, you're saying Aurora was stolen by traffickers at birth?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua nodded eagerly, emboldened by his own lies. "Yes, absolutely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no one had seen him abandon the child. He was untouchable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you claim to love your daughter dearly?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Joshua exclaimed, his voice dripping with faux sincerity. "She's my flesh and blood. How could I not love her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's smile deepened, like a predator toying with its prey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, h</span><span>e raised a hand and snapped his fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, then, let's take a look at just how much Mr. Elvador loves his daughter."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his signal, the massive screen behind them flickered to life.</span></p></div>
