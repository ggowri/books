        <h1>Chapter 130 A Tragic Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> furious roar nearly shattered the cold iron bars. His veins bulged as he glared at the woman, the woman who had destroyed his life and hurt Aurora. He wanted to tear her to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You venomous witch!" His voice was hoarse, raw with rage that surged from the depths of his soul. At this moment, he looked like a wild beast driven to madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, however, only tilted her head back and laughed even more recklessly. With her current disheveled state, she looked like a ghost from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, </span><span>Hubery</span><span> had been one of </span><span>Orley's</span><span> most renowned elite lawyers, confident and full of ambition. Back then, he had been valuable to Bertha, she had put on a gentle, charming facade to please him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his legs were crippled, he was confined to a wheelchair, his clothes were cheap and wrinkled, his complexion sallow, and he reeked of an unbearable stench from days of unwashed filth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To a selfish woman like Bertha, a man with no value was worthless. No need to maintain pretenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you weren't such a hopeless fool, how could I have ever used you? You have no right to blame me. Blame yourself for being blind, na&iuml;ve, and utterly stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me guess, Aurora told you the truth, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, a sinister smile creeping, "She must be heartbroken, utterly disappointed in you. No matter how much you begged, she still refused to forgive you, didn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, clutching her stomach, she let out a sharp, piercing laugh. "Oh, poor little </span><span>Hubery</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had always been </span><span>an</span><span> self-centered person. Now that she had fallen into such a wretched state, she couldn't stand the thought of suffering alone. She wanted to drag others down with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, now useless to her, was the perfect target for her cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She unleashed all the negativity pent up, watching with twisted satisfaction as </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> face contorted with fury, guilt, and regret. The sheer torment on his face gave her a sick sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery</span><span> violently shook the iron bars, his expression terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wicked woman! Wretched snake! You'll never have a good ending!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of Bertha's deception flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used Aurora's hard-earned money to please Bertha. He had even sent Aurora to prison for five years for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was consumed by overwhelming regret, drowning him in unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha sneered, "I'll never have a good ending? I am the heiress of </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group. My parents and my brother adore me. They will get me out of here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> expression twisted with rage, but soon, a cruel smirk formed on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heiress of </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group? You? You really don't know, do you? </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Group has gone bankrupt. Your brother was arrested, your parents offended Hawke Group's president, and both had their legs broken. They can't even protect themselves, let alone remember a pathetic fake heiress like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfaction surged through him as he finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had tormented him. Now it was his turn to return the favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expected to see her panic, anger, or desperation. But no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she merely smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said casually, "What does their bankruptcy have to do with me? My biological parents are billionaires. They would never let me rot in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's</span><span> expression froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Bertha, trying to see through her, to prove she was bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop playing games. If they were so powerful, why did they let you stay in the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family for so many years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth, his voice filled with reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha gave him a mocking smirk. "Do you think I wanted to stay there? It was all part of my parents' plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What plan?" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back leisurely in her chair, Bertha looked at him like he was a fool. "Oh, please. You think I'd just tell you? Don't flatter yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wasted all your intelligence on Aurora. Do you know why you were chosen as my defense attorney? Because they knew you and Aurora were childhood friends. Only if you personally sent her to prison would her pain be unbearable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was filled with twisted pride. "Otherwise, do you really think a fresh graduate would be qualified to defend for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, each lawyer can win that case. Whoever took it would have become famous overnight. You weren't special, </span><span>Hubery</span><span>. Just lucky and happened to ride </span><span>the our</span><span> coattails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Poor Aurora. What&rsquo;s the poor girl&rsquo;s luck? A mother too busy chasing love, a father who just walked away, a brother who wanted her gone, and then you&mdash;a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; who threw her under the bus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora's downfall wasn't my fault. It was you, the ones closest to her, who pushed her into the abyss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha never once believed she had done anything wrong. In her mind, she had simply fought for what she deserved in a world where only the strong survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora's so-called loved ones had truly trusted her, if they had been strong-willed enough, how could they so easily </span><span>swayed</span><span> by her manipulations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Aurora weren't even blood-related. Why should she have given up everything just because Aurora came back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had managed to trample Aurora, the real heiress, into the dirt, then that was simply her own skill and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora wanted revenge, she could try doing the same to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha crossed her arms, watching </span><span>Hubery's</span><span> ever-changing expressions with great amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw his hatred for her, his guilt for Aurora, but not a single trace of reflection on his own mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Shut up!" </span><span>Hubery</span><span> screamed like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was furious, his eyes bloodshot. "Bertha, you're a devil! I was just a pawn in your schemes. You are the true mastermind behind all of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil?" Bertha let out a cold laugh. "This world is survival of the fittest. I simply did what I needed. And you, weren't you after my beauty and my status? Didn't you want to gain something from me? Otherwise, why would you have ignored Aurora's sincerity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used you, yes. But did I ever force you to take Aurora's money and use it to buy designer brands and pretend to be a rich heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with mockery as she stared straight at </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, enunciating each word. "Aurora was slapped in prison, forced to be humble, stabbed with needles, and had her legs broken. You knew about it, didn't you? And yet, you did nothing to stop it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck </span><span>Hubery</span><span> in his very core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he had to admit it. He had been blinded by vanity, leading him to commit an unforgivable mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been brilliant in high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had shined too brightly, overshadowing him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A part of him had been jealous. He had merely wanted to dim her light a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora is just a woman. What good is being so accomplished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he still </span><span>had to</span><span> get married, raise children, and become a housewife</span><span>.</span><span> As for me... I'm perfectly capable of making money. I can provide for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is she so proud?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had buried these thoughts deep, knowing they were distasteful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had watched as others bullied Aurora, never lifting a finger to stop it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that once she was broken, he could swoop in, offer her warmth, and she would finally depend on him, abandoning any dreams of becoming a scholar, mentor, or professor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wanted to clip her wings not to hurt her, she wouldn't have to struggle anymore. He would be her harbor, take care of her, and love her. He believed this was the better outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had never expected that even after all the suffering, Aurora remained unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did she refuse to rely on him, but she also despised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent over a decade together in the orphanage, sharing a deep bond. Yet, Aurora abandoned him without hesitation. To </span><span>Hubery</span><span>, she was far too heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She now finds a man who clearly has a violent streak and is even carrying his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How shameless!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated how foolish Aurora was. But he hated Bertha even more, for manipulating </span><span>him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it weren't for Bertha, how could things have ended up like this?</span></p></div>
