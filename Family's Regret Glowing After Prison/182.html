        <h1>Chapter 182 Celeste Recognizes Aurora Instantly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched Celeste from the shadows, her gut churning with pure hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did it ever hit you, Celeste?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just because you fell for some lowlife and rushed into marriage, you'd end up dragging your life into such a hopeless pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Your son's rotting in prison, your daughter's permanently disabled, and you lost an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You could've been something, but you were too stupid and small-minded to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now look at you. Everything that's happened? You brought this on yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips twisted into an ice-cold smirk. Having a mother like this was the biggest shame of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated Joshua, but she hated Celeste even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her pathetic life&mdash;over twenty years of bullshit&mdash;sure, Joshua started this mess, but Celeste was neck-deep in it too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at Celeste with complete indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was gently "putting to sleep" the doll in her arms, before starting to mumble to the empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, </span><span>sweetie, Mommy's </span><span>gonna</span><span> keep you safe. Won't let those bad people steal you again. You believe me, right? God, I love you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed that doll's face like it was her actual kid, her precious baby she claimed to love so damn much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mockery in Aurora's eyes grew even more evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where were you when it mattered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that you've lost everything, you finally understand what's precious</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad it's way too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Celeste finally getting what was coming to her, Aurora felt some of that weight lift off her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora saw no reason to stick around any longer. After all, during those miserable days when she was wrongfully imprisoned, Celeste hadn't visited her even once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> was</span><span>n't here to check on </span><span>h</span><span>e</span><span>r</span><span>. She just wanted to see firsthand how pathetic the woman who had caused her endless pain had become. Now that she'd witnessed it, she could leave with closure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was about to turn away, a wild-eyed patient suddenly rushed up to Celeste, snatched the doll from her hands, and took off running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, who had been lost in her loving fantasy just seconds before, completely lost it. Her emotions exploded like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! My daughter! Stop! Give her back to me!" Celeste screamed at the top of her lungs, chasing after the other patient without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the madman was too fast. No matter how hard Celeste pushed herself, she couldn't catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give her back! My daughter! My Aurora!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After putting some distance between them, the madman seemed to realize Celeste wasn't keeping up. He stopped and turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Celeste sobbing her heart out, he broke into a huge grin, showing a mouthful of crooked teeth, and laughed with childish delight, "She's crying! </span><span>So </span><span>fun</span><span>ny</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shook with rage at the madman. "Give me back my daughter!" she shouted, pointing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The madman treated it like some sick game. "No way. What are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> do about it, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he held the doll high above his head and slammed it violently against the ground. Each brutal impact felt like a hammer to Celeste's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you, you monster!" Celeste </span><span>screamed,</span><span> her eyes bloodshot as she lunged forward again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her coming, the madman quickly snatched up the doll and bolted, cackling as he ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste chased after him desperately but couldn't catch up this time either. During the pursuit, she spotted Aurora standing nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped dead in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes locked onto Aurora, face going through recognition, confusion, and bewilderment before something finally clicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears running down her face, but now she was grinning like a kid on Christmas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora? Is it really you? You finally came to see me?" she reached out, all desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora just stood there, ice queen mode activated, staring through her like she was looking at some rando off the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stumbled toward her, babbling, "Aurora, </span><span>I</span><span> miss you so much. </span><span>S</span><span>tay with me, okay? Don't leave me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she rushed toward Aurora, medical staff intercepted Celeste, blocking her from getting anywhere near her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go!" Celeste struggled wildly. "I need to hold my daughter! That's my daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strength was surprisingly powerful as she clawed at the air with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched it all go down, face cold as stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she expected. The moment she stopped giving a shit about that mother's love she'd been chasing, it all seemed like garbage anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile was dead inside. "Mrs. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>, after today, we're done. For good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Daniel. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her mind was unraveling, Celeste understood every word Aurora said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head </span><span>violent</span><span>ly. "No! Don't leave! I will protect you! I can't lose you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how gut-wrenching her screams became, Aurora acted like she couldn't hear a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora's figure grew smaller in the distance, Celeste's emotional defenses completely collapsed. Her voice turned hoarse from screaming, now sounding more like a wounded animal's growl. "Don't go! Don't go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strength was so overwhelming that several medical staff members almost lost control trying to restrain her, even with all their combined efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a doctor jabbed a needle into Celeste's arm, injecting a sedative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's body jerked, her consciousness starting to blur around the edges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, her eyes stayed locked on Aurora's retreating form, filled with pure desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical staff huddled around Celeste. "This patient's way too emotional today. We should strap her to the bed when we get back. Saves us the trouble if she wakes up and goes crazy again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, totally." They dragged Celeste away without a hint of gentleness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside the mental hospital, Aurora took a deep breath, savoring the taste of freedom in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are we heading now, Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora paused, thinking it over. "Tomorrow, I want to see Joshua and Bertha. My kidney's been doing time in Bertha's body long enough. It's about time I got it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Hawke Estate, Aurora trudged to her room, each step feeling heavier than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just that small outing had wiped her out completely. Her legs ached, and her whole body felt like a phone on one percent battery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a bitter laugh. It seemed like her time really was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, she'd finished her embroidery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been almost a year since she'd lost her hearing, plunging her into a world without sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had seriously messed with her ability to speak. Several times, she'd had words right on the tip of her tongue, only to find herself unable to get them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she couldn't stay in the Hawke Estate much longer. Once she got </span><span>her </span><span>kidney back tomorrow, it would be time for her to </span><span>leave</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's thoughts drifted as she slowly fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the study, Daniel was updating Julian on Aurora's schedule for the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span> wants to visit Joshua and Bertha tomorrow," Daniel said. "The </span><span>mountain </span><span>trails are rough, and I'm worried about her health holding up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat quietly in his chair. After a long pause, he finally spoke, "I'll go with her."</span></p></div>
