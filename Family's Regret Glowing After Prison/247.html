        <h1>Chapter 247 Epilogue: Aurora XLI</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily glanced down at herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was neatly dressed, and it was clear that Ethan hadn't taken advantage of her when she was drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's head was killing her. Never drank before, so she had no inkling that she'd wild out when drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Aurora's big day. Lily was so hyped that she went too hard with the drinks, didn't see this mess coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to keep it together. Staring at Ethan's pitiful appearance, she murmured, "I'm sorry. I was drunk, I didn't mean for any of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan </span><span>fixed his eyes on her. "</span><span>Miss</span><span>, you took advantage of me. Do you think a mere apology suffices?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt that she was in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Ethan wasn't going to let it go easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily knew she was in the wrong this time, so his anger came as no surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were her</span><span>, she would have called the police long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, her face etched with shame, said, "I'm really sorry. I understand apologies won't fix this. Just tell me what you want. If it's within my power, I'll do everything I can to make amends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan found it amusing, yet his expression remained perfectly neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that he really enjoyed teasing Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this behavior wasn't commendable, he didn't want to miss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice in his heart whispered that she was the only girl who was an absolutely perfect fit for his taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to go to any lengths to get involved with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan took a deep breath and said, "Look, I know it wasn't </span><span>your </span><span>intention, but what's done is done. You even stole my first kiss. I'm old-fashioned. Since you almost took my virginity today, why don't I be your boyfriend from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd assumed Ethan would demand financial restitution or some arduous task, yet his request caught her completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she remained silent for an extended period, </span><span>Ethan became nervous</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Will she disagree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan steadied his nerves and continued, "Remember when you promised me a favor in the car? Well, consider this. Be my girlfriend, and I'll be your boyfriend. If we're a couple, all this will make perfect sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily came back to her senses and stared at him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very handsome and exactly her cup of tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very first moment she laid eyes on him, an inexplicable sense of familiarity and closeness welled up within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she didn't </span><span>hate</span><span> him and had indeed taken advantage of him, she'd</span><span> better</span><span> take </span><span>her </span><span>responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span> cleared her throat to relieve the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this your only request?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan nodded. "Yes, it is. Do you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan dropped his eyes, holding back his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally, she's mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him, as if he'd finally claimed a treasure he'd yearned for </span><span>like forever</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew for real&mdash;he'd never caught feelings this hard for any girl before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe this was that love at first sight stuff hitting different, coming outta nowhere, just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily tidied up her clothes, stood up from the bed, and said, "The wedding is almost over. Let's go out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was positively elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He straightened his clothes and then, side by side with Lily, exited the lounge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the banquet hall, they met Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy grabbed Lily's arm and asked, "Lily, where have you been? You've been gone for so long, and you didn't even answer my calls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily </span><span>stole a glance</span><span> at Etha</span><span>n</span><span> and blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was drunk, so I took a nap in the lounge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see." Daisy didn't think much of it and pulled her in front of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took Lily's hand. "Lily, you must be tired today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily smiled gently, "It's your wedding day. I'm not tired at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora patted her hand. </span><span>"</span><span>W</span><span>here are you going later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Maybe head back to the</span><span> Institute</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"T</span><span>hen t</span><span>ake our car. We'll drop you off on the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily shook her head. "</span><span>Nah, </span><span>I can go back by myself. It's your wedding day, and being with Mr. Hawke should be your top priority."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pushed Aurora into Julian's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian raised his eyebrows. "Why don't we let Ethan take you back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was all over that idea. "Mr. and Mrs. Hawke, I got you. I'll make sure she gets back safe and sound."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then h</span><span>e turned to Lily. "</span><span>You ready?</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span>et's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting his earnest, unwavering gaze, she felt a twinge of embarrassment, yet found herself unable to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stepped out of the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, the rain had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily got into Ethan's car and left first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Julian were close to the car when, all of a sudden, a soft voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped in her tracks. Despite a decade passing since she'd last heard that voice, it was still familiar to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without responding, she continued on her way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste pleaded, "Aurora,</span><span> </span><span>I simply want to extend my best wishes for your wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stopped again and said coldly, "I heard it. You can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face contorted with pain. "It's been ten years. Won't you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ten years straight, she was missing Aurora like crazy. All she wanted was to face her, say sorry for all the messed up stuff, and take care of her, trying to fix what she did wrong before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Celeste knew Aurora wasn't having any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing how Aurora didn't play, even though she was dying to see her, she never showed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been holding back for ten whole years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Celeste wasn't even fifty but her hair was going gray and she was looking old enough to be somebody's grandma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her constant yearning for Aurora all day long resulted in her very poor health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell that she didn't have much time left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste merely wished to see Aurora get married with her own eyes and bear witness to her happiness before her own passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped she could hold out until Aurora became a mother. Should Aurora allow her to visit her future grandchild, she would have no lingering regrets in her lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such expectations, Celeste came to Putnam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't get into Celestia Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> just</span><span> wait</span><span>ed</span><span> outside. In a sense, it felt to her as though she had witnessed Aurora's wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste regarded Aurora with eyes brimming with anticipation, aching to earn Aurora's forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the end, she was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at her with extreme indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask yourself if you deserve my forgiveness."</span></p></div>
