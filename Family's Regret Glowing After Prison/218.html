        <h1>Chapter 218 Epilogue: Aurora XII</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched eagerly, but Celeste's expression didn't show the doting affection she had expected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, when Celeste saw the unconscious Megan and Bertha, along with Barnett writhing in pain on the ground, her head throbbed violently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashbacks hit her har</span><span>d.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you knew Bertha pushed Camille down the stairs. Why </span><span>cover for </span><span>her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my birth mo</span><span>m</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>Yet you erased the footage that could've cleared my name. How could you </span><span>be so cruel to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, it wasn't me. You've got the wrong person&mdash;it was Bertha!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Was I just a pawn for you</span><span>? Fine, I'll repay your 'kindness.' You only b</span><span>irthed me</span><span> but never raised me. That debt isn't worth much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all murderers. You drove me to my death. I don't care about my innocence anymore&mdash;I just want you dead!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celeste, your beloved husband </span><span>took</span><span> your kidney for his mistress, and the daughter you coddled was that woman's child. Karma's finally catching up with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene in the stairwell was </span><span>a mirror of</span><span> the past, flooding Celeste with memories of her former life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those brutal images tore through her mind, making her head feel like it was splitting, her heart aching as if stabbed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The daughter I carried for ten months was abandoned by that bastard Joshua to suffer in an orphanage, while he forced me to raise Bertha, that illegitimate child</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> kidney was t</span><span style="font-style: italic;">aken</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and given to Isabella.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My daughter's kidney was </span><span style="font-style: italic;">taken</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and given to Bertha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When I learned the truth and tried to take revenge on Joshua, he stabbed me in the eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories tortured her until she collapsed, her body convulsing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora frowned at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Celeste so heartbroken seeing Barnett and Bertha covered in blood that she can't even stand?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But in my old life, when I was covered in scars, Celeste was living her life like nothing happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Guess </span><span style="font-style: italic;">she can't even be bothered to pretend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shot Celeste a cold glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the total lack of hope in Aurora's eyes felt like a thousand arrows hitting Celeste's hear</span><span>t. I</span><span>t hurt so much she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting through the agony, she stretched a trembling hand toward Aurora. Her gaze was filled with endless remorse and anguish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I know how stupid I was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, please believe in me one more time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, I'll give you all my love and cherish you. You're my true treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's voice was so faint that Aurora didn't even catch what she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not that it matters. Whatever she's saying, it's definitely nothing good.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's the same old insults&mdash;calling me a monster, ungrateful, wicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've heard it all before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, let's go. My mom will worry if she can't find me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian took Aurora's hand, and the two walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste tried to stand and chase after them, but her grief had paralyzed her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was let tears of regret stream down her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hadn't gone far when Laura and William came running toward her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura immediately pulled Aurora into a hug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh, my s</span><span>weetheart, you scared me to death! Let me check&mdash;are you hurt anywhere?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shook her head. "Mom, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's expression darkened with fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they lay a finger on my princess? They've got a death wish."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William added angrily, "Mom, it was that same brother and sister from the children's store yesterday. They got into Celestia Palace, barged into the lounge, and tried to hit Aurora and me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura instantly </span><span>turned</span><span> into protective mo</span><span>de</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pointed toward the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're over there. They even tried to frame me for pushing Megan down the stairs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Laura's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried Aurora step by step to the stairwell, looking down </span><span>with authority</span><span>, just as Celeste's remorseful gaze met hers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste saw Laura cradling Aurora so tenderly, </span><span>the undeniable </span><span>mother-daughter bond between them, her heartache momentarily vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scrambled to her feet, pointing at Laura and shouting, "Put down my daughter!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura froze. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes locked onto Aurora. "The child in your arms is my daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm your mother. Come to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste's behavior was off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She shouldn't even recognize me at this point. Yesterday at the store, she didn't know who I was and even helped Bertha bully me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why the sudden change?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Celeste also </span><span style="font-style: italic;">get a second chance</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought almost made Aurora laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste hurt me so deeply in my old life. Just because we've gone back in time, does that mean I should forgive her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Let her keep dreaming!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have a better mother now,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">who</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">truly loves m</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. I don't need Celeste's affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tightened her arms around Laura's neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy, that woman looks scary. I'm afraid."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura patted her back soothingly. "I'm here. Don't be scared."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phrase "that woman" hit Celeste like a hammer, making her head pound.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not some stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm </span><span style="font-style: italic;">her </span><span style="font-style: italic;">mother. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Her</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> real mother</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora was supposed to be in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is she in Putnam? And adopted by someone else?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She has a new mother now. From yesterday, it's clear this woman gives her all the love she needs</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. S</span><span style="font-style: italic;">he's no longer starved for affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That makes me, her birth mother, completely unnecessary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I haven't even atoned yet. I haven't repaid the debt I owe her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can Aurora already not want me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streaming down her face, Celeste reached out desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your real mother. Aurora, please, come to me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora inwardly sneered</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now you remember you're my mother? Too late!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her head from Laura's shoulder, feigning childish innocence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're my birth mother, why did you abandon me in an orphanage the moment I was born? Did you hate me that much?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question struck Celeste like a fatal blow.</span></p></div>
