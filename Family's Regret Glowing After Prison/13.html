        <h1>Chapter 13 Living a Laid-Back Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora knew they didn't care, those words still hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua didn't even pretend to love her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora hid her feelings well; no one could see the pain behind her tough exterior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," said Aurora indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned, "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, her gaze solemn as she stared at </span><span>them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving Elvador Villa now. From today, I'm cutting all ties with the Elvador family. Don't worry, I won't bother you anymore." In her heart, she vowed she'd rather die outside than return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she let go of any attachment to this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three years of hurt, Aurora had learned her lesson. Why wish for family love that wasn't hers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked quickly, her injured leg aching, but she gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was finally a light in her eyes&mdash;the light of breaking free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Aurora opened the living room door and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't look back, and her back was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's </span><span>eyes widen</span><span>. He wanted to chase after Aurora, but the excruciating stomach cramps made him too weak to even stand up. He could only shout at the slowly closing door, "Aurora, come back here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shout echoed through the large living room and drained all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't look back and only vaguely heard someone shouting something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't make out exactly what it was because the door behind her had closed, and her right ear had poor hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, whatever it was, it had nothing to do with her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Aurora stepped out of the Elvador Villa, her tense nerves finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked briskly. After about five minutes, a man appeared in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, seeing a man suddenly, Aurora felt her heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively moved away from the street light and stood in the pitch-black shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was walking in a hurry. As he got closer, Aurora recognized him at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Darren Lowell, Barnett's friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's deepest impression of Darren could be summed up in two words&mdash;sarcastic and mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered the first time she had seen him. He sized her up from head to toe and casually commented, "So shabby. If it weren't for the slight resemblance to Barnett, it'd be hard to tell you're from the Elvador family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said this, Barnett was right beside him. Barnett didn't stop Darren's rudeness to her but just let out a non-committal snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, what hurt Aurora the most wasn't Darren's deliberate provocation but Barnett's indifferent attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was only fifteen years old then. Despite having a family, when she was being bullied, not a single family member stood up for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like a stray dog at that time, which was so pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren walked past her without noticing her in the shadow of the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes followed his figure until he entered the Elvador Villa. Then, she realized that Darren was probably going to see Barnett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping out of the shadow, Aurora quickened her pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she had planned to find a hotel to stay for the night and look for a job the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she changed her mind and wanted to leave Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had heard what the three members of the Elvador family said in the study. Joshua intended to follow Adolph's demand and make her go to the hospital and apologize to Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why should she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste knew that it was Bertha who had pushed Camille downstairs and caused her to become a vegetable, yet they still insisted on making Aurora take the blame for Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had yearned for her parents' love and had paid the price of five years in prison, a broken leg, partial deafness, and the loss of a kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was already in a mess, barely able to bear any loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Joshua and Celeste wanted Aurora to pay for Barnett's impulsiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of the Elvador Group, Aurora was certain that the Elvador family would come looking for her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She resented the Elvador family and was even more afraid of Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had experienced Adolph's means of torture in prison. It was the darkest period of her life, and she didn't want to go through it again. Her body couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she had to leave Orley as soon as possible and run far away. She wanted to get to a place where they couldn't find her and live out the rest of her life in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She counted the money in her hand. There were two thousand dollars, all given to her by Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes became moist at thinking of Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know if she would ever have the chance to repay Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood by the roadside for a long time before finally flagging down a taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" asked the driver, rolling down the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora asked, "Sir, how much does it cost to go to Sounan Railway Station?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you leaving Orley? During the day, three hundred dollars would be enough, but it's so late now. It'll be a bit more expensive. Five hundred and fifty dollars. Can you accept that?" said the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora got into the car without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was set on leaving Orley. Her plan? Head to Sounan Railway Station, then catch a train to Gelaun in northeast Peloland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The houses there were super cheap, and they were perfect for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By staying in a remote, cold city like Gelaun, she was sure the Elvador family would never find her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about a peaceful life alone in Gelaun, hope flickered in her cold heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against the car window, taking in the beautiful night view of Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyscrapers stood in rows. The outer walls of the buildings were decorated with various neon lights, creating a colorful display. Some flashed fashionable brand logos, and some showed exquisite advertisements, adding charm to this bustling city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm yellow glow of the street lights spread across Aurora's face, giving her a touch of softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were few cars on the road, and the taxi sped along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, she finally arrived at Sounan Railway Station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took her ID card and went to the ticket counter. Fortunately, she managed to buy a ticket for the train that departed at one in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only needed to wait for one more hour to embark on the journey to Gelaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiting room of the railway station was relatively empty at night. Aurora found a quiet and unoccupied corner and sat down to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, she seemed to hear announcements on the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, she was tired and sleepy, and with her poor right-ear hearing, she couldn't make out anything at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about five minutes, the announcement on the platform came again. "Dear passengers, the train departing from Sounan to Gelaun is now starting to check tickets. Passengers taking this train, please organize your luggage and proceed to the ticket-checking gate to check in and board the train."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was startled and quickly opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurriedly looked towards the ticket-checking gate. At this time, passengers were already queuing up to check in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was filled with uncontrollable excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she passed the ticket-checking and boarded the train, the Elvador family would never be able to find her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't waste any more time and quickly got up, going to the ticket-checking gate to queue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora followed the person in front of her closely. When it was her turn, she immediately handed the ticket to the ticket checker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the ticket checker was about to reach for the ticket, a large hand suddenly reached out from the side, tightly covering Aurora's slender hand and the ticket in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned around and widened her eyes suddenly.</span></p></div>
