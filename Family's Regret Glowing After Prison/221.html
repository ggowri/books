        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was so shocked that his eyes nearly </span><span>popped out of his skull</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Julian was a little devil, but he never expected the boy to be cunning enough to frame him for a crime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson glared at Julian with pure hatred. "You vile bastard&mdash;I hope you </span><span>rot in hell</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smirked coldly, "I'm a bastard? And what does that make you? Anderson, you should worry about yourself first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yo-you!" Anderson was so furious he nearly passed out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'd known you'd grow up this wicked</span><span>," he spat, voice trembling, "I</span><span>'</span><span>d have drowned you at birth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained unfazed by his outburst. After all, the man was just flailing in his death throes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the Hawke household was in chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson was arrested for intentional assault, while Judy was rushed to the </span><span>ER</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian lay in bed, staring out the window, completely at peace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't wait for tomorrow. Then I'll see Aurora again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month </span><span>flew by, and a lot went down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, Anderson was sentenced to five years in prison for intentional assault.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, having lost her tongue, suffered a massive psychological blow and became emotionally unstable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, ever the "thoughtful" child, even paid her a visit at the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Judy saw him, she flew into a frenzy, practically foaming at the mouth with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Julian had her committed to a psychiatric facility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one questioned it. They thought she'd gone nuts after Anderson cut out her tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one suspected that a ten-year-old boy had orchestrated it all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month later, the Barron household was buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's acceptance letter had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her outstanding academic record, she had been admitted to MIT.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura clutched the acceptance letter, tears of joy streaming down their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora really got the highest SAT score?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora really got into MIT?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God, </span><span>Julian is </span><span>a genius</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barrons looked at Aurora as if she were a rare treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly caught them off guard was the swarm of reporters who descended upon their home upon hearing the news.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cameras flashed incessantly, their blinding lights nearly overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Microphones were practically shoved into Aurora's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, a perfect SAT score was wild.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at five years old?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was insane. A full-blown miracle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters' eyes burned with fervor as they stared at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could already see the headlines: Prodigy Genius! Future Nobel Winner?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They scrambled over each other for the exclusive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barron residence was packed, the atmosphere electric.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By evening, Benjamin and Laura were exhausted, their throats dry from nonstop talking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they looked at Aurora, their eyes were pure adoration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but feel grateful for the Elvador family's stupidity. </span><br><span>How could they have abandoned such a brilliant child in an orphanage?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura cradled Aurora in her arms, gently stroking her hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Look at how brilliant this little mind is.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said softly, "Aurora, how about we throw you a grand celebration party for your admission?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled sweetly, playing the perfect little angel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll have my celebration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, both she and Bertha had gotten into college.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had only made it into a mediocre school, while Aurora had been accepted into the prestigious Vertar University.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Elvadors had only thrown a celebration for Bertha.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that very party, Aurora had been handcuffed by the police.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, their lives had diverged completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha became the Elvador family's heir, the darling of Orley's high society.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, overnight, became a murderer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, not only did she have loving parents and a</span><span> big </span><span>brother, but she also had friends&mdash;and now, her celebration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her greatest regret had been missing out on college, forced to spend those years behind bars instead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everything was different. She would finally experience university life for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome with emotion, tears spilled uncontrollably down Aurora's cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura panicked. "Sweetheart, why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hugged her neck tightly. "Mommy, thank you for bringing me home from the orphanage. Otherwise, I'd never have known </span><span>what </span><span>happiness </span><span>feels </span><span>like."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's </span><span>heart </span><span>softened further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry, my love. Whatever others have, you'll have them, too&mdash;no, even better."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin wrapped his long arms around both Laura and Aurora, and William joined in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family of four embraced, and the scene was heartwarming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, once again, the moment was shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I've come to take you home. Come with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's voice rang out from outside the villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't go in!" a servant protested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move! Don't stop me</span><span>! M</span><span>y daughter is in there!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief commotion, Celeste barged in&mdash;only to see Aurora nestled happily in the Barrons' arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart lurched. The sight was like a knife to her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora is my daughter. How dare they hold her like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In my old life, when I brought Aurora home, she was still in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the hell </span><span style="font-style: italic;">is she in Putnam now?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes flicked around&mdash;then lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So that</span><span>'</span><span>s what happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, the Barrons must</span><span>'</span><span>ve taken Aurora i</span><span>n </span><span>and dumped her later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s how she ended up back in the orphanage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were just gonna toss her away again, then fine.</span><span> </span><span>Celeste would take her back first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I know the truth now. This time, I won't hurt Aurora like before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll give her all my love, spoil her like a princess</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">and make Bertha </span><span style="font-style: italic;">pay for everything she did. Ten times over. No, a hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste convinced herself she was absolutely right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then</span><span>, she shot the Barrons a disdainful look. "You already have a son of your own. Why must you steal my daughter?"</span></p></div>
