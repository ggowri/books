        <h1>Chapter 229 Epilogue: Aurora 23</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart clenched tightly, and a searing pain shot through her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this new life, Daisy had never crossed paths with her, which meant she didn't have a clue who Aurora was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora had </span><span>steeled</span><span> herself mentally for this very scenario, the harsh reality still hit her </span><span>hard</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, in the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> Villa, </span><span>Daisy</span><span> was the sole person who truly had Aurora's back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in this lifetime, they were </span><span>strangers to each other</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a lump in her throat and a stinging in her nose. She quickly dropped her gaze, desperately trying to mask the roiling emotions within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft, dulcet voice, she said, "I'm Aurora Barron. I'm here to see Mrs. Celeste Elvador."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated for a second, a bit taken aback, and then replied, "You mean Ms. Jerome, don't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Jerome?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, she must be talking about Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It looks like a whole lot has gone down between her and Joshua while I've been buried in my research.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, she </span><span>nodded and flashed a smile. "Is Ms. Jerome home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy then graciously invited Aurora inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Aurora stepped into the villa, a flood of memories washed over her. It was as if she'd been back in time to when she'd first been welcomed into the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family straight from the orphanage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place looked pretty much the same as she remembered, as if time had stood still.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her most was seeing Barnett standing awkwardly next to the couch, getting scolded by Celeste, whose expression was icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett protested, resentment written all over his face, "Mom, how did you become this way? You pampered Bertha so much when we were kids, and now you're so cruel! You divorce Dad and kick Bertha out of the house!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha</span><span>'s</span><span> a child of an affair, but she's innocent! Why punish her for something </span><span>her parents</span><span> did? She's always been sickly. You were always beating and scolding her. If something were to happen to her, it would be on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being punished, Barnett showed no empathy toward his mother, directing all his accusations at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no understanding of what she must have been feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father had an affair with a mistress and even brought the mistress's daughter home, dumping her on his wife to raise. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Celeste hadn't regained her past-life memories, she'd have been in the same boat as before, raising Bertha as if she were her own and spoiling her rotten like a little princess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All for the sake of that mistress's daughter, Celeste had humiliated her own flesh and blood at will.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a </span><span>cruel </span><span>deal for any mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet</span><span>,</span><span> Barnett had no pity for his mother; instead, he chose to sympathize with the daughter of his dad's mistress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, she grabbed an ashtray from the coffee table and slammed it onto Barnett's head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact split his forehead, blood spilling down his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she stared at the injured Barnett, a flicker of recognition crossed Celeste's mind&mdash;not compassion for her son but a painful memory from her past, where she had once struck Aurora with the same ashtray.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, nobody cared about </span><span>Aurora</span><span>. She lay on the cold floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daisy hadn't taken Aurora away, she might have died that cold, rainy night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those thoughts filled her, Celeste's eyes welled up with tears, and her body began to tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett caught sight of </span><span>it</span><span> and sneered. "You hurt me with your own hands, and now you pretend to feel hurt? Isn't that a bit hypocritical?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over all these years, all you've cared about is </span><span>that</span><span> Aurora. You've never seen the good in me or Bertha.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" Aurora was spoiled by the Barron family; she didn't even care to come back home. What's so great about her anyway? She was such a brat growing up, and she hasn't changed.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and by the way, she vanished eight years ago. Who knows if she's alive? What good is being a genius if you can't enjoy life? She's probably dead by now</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste saw red. In a flash, she whipped her hand up, ready to slap Barnett across the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett, with a blood-smeared face, craned his neck defiantly and spat out, "Come on</span><span>! Take </span><span>a swing at me! Now that Bertha's gone, I've got no reason to hang around. Death would be a sweet release.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your own daughter is six feet under! If you off me too, you'll be all alone in this world!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You&mdash;"</span><span> Celeste was shaking like a leaf with fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a gentle voice cut through the charged atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid you're in for a letdown, Mr. </span><span>Elvador</span><span>. I'm </span><span>very much</span><span> kicking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste snapped her head up and saw Aurora striding in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, tears gushed down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, is it really you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There stood eighteen-year-old Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was both familiar and yet a stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was a carbon copy of the one from her past life. Thanks to the good genes from both Celeste and that no-good Joshua, she was a real stunner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current Aurora was worlds apart from the one Celeste remembered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Aurora was a pretty thing, but she was </span><span>tiny</span><span>, skin-and-bones.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she stood there, tall and self-assured, a statuesque 5 feet 7 inches, with a figure that was both eye-catching and well-nourished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stark contrast was a glaring reminder of how the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family had never given a hoot about her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste sprang up from the couch and made a beeline for Aurora. "Aurora, is it really you?</span><span> </span><span>Have you finally come back to see me?</span><span> </span><span>Does this mean you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> take off again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste peppered her daughter with questions, beside herself with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora kept her cool. Despite Celeste's enthusiasm, her expression remained as calm as a cucumber.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste approached with open arms, ready to wrap her in a hug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, she'd yearned for a mother's embrace, but it had always been out of reach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she had a father, a mother, and a brother. To her, Celeste and Barnett were nothing more than distant kin, strangers tied by blood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, she gave Celeste a hard shove.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste staggered backward, nearly biting the dust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of hurt crossed Celeste's face. "Aurora, can't you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept her lips zipped and just shot her a look full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Celeste felt the full weight of her past screw-ups. She knew deep down she didn't deserve forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing her pride, she forced a smile and asked, "Aurora, where have you been all these years?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of your business."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The awkwardness between them was thick enough to cut with a knife, and Celeste was left tongue-tied again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Barnett let out a sneering laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly walked over, </span><span>looking</span><span> every </span><span>bit</span><span> the tall, good-looking guy he'd been in her past life.</span></p></div>
