        <h1>Chapter 171 The Reunion</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily felt her sanity teetering on the edge, caught in the double torment of anger and embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shoved against Ethan with all her strength, her hands pounding on his chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! What</span><span> the hell </span><span>do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan remained unmoved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His large hands firmly seized her wrists, pinning them against the partition of the stall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the confined space, their breaths mingled, thickening the charged atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want? Don't you already know? What? You used me last night, and now you want to cast me aside? What do you take me for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was deep and husky, and his warm breath brushed against Lily's ear, sending a wave of heat coursing through her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel her legs weaken in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s face burned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last night was an accident... Can we just pretend nothing happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan let out a cold laugh, his expression darkening. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used me up and now want to walk away like nothing happened? And you call that an accident?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, do I look like the kind of guy who lets things slide after being played?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Lily speechless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't find a single retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, it had been her insisting on drinking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had gotten drunk and clung to him, refusing to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though many details were blurred by alcohol, one particular scene stood out clearly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had straddled him, completely uninhibited. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That scene was etched deeply in her mind, making her awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, she wanted to slap herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must be crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I was desperate enough to sleep with a gay man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily turned her head away, unable to meet Ethan's gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't mean to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan didn</span><span>'</span><span>t buy her excuse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, she had confessed to him in her drunken state, admitting that she had fallen for him at first sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder she</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'s</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> so forward in bed</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">S</span><span style="font-style: italic;">he must have wanted </span><span style="font-style: italic;">me</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, it was also the first time Ethan had experienced anything so intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the day, all he could think about were the images of them tangled together, and he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t focus on his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the one who caused it all, didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to take responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t let that slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan suddenly lowered his head and kissed Lily's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was shocked by the sudden action, her eyes wide open, and as she tried to pull away, footsteps and voices echoed from outside. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone entered the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s heart skipped a beat, and she quickly gave Ethan a look, signaling that someone was coming, urging him to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan only teased her, not loosening his grip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his hand slipped under her shirt, starting to roam freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s heart leapt to her throat, but she dared not make a sound, fearing the others might hear them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps grew closer and turned to another stall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the sound of voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I just saw Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't she in prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She must be out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, who would've thought? The former top student of Orley High School turned murderer. You really can't judge a book by its cover. Back in high school, she seemed so quiet and well-behaved. It turns out it was all just an act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! What good is being smart? Now she</span><span>'</span><span>s just a convict."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In high school, she was so full of herself just because she had good grades. Even when the most popular guy in our class pursued her, she barely paid him any attention. Look at her now. She's a convict. What's left for her to be arrogant about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow</span><span>'</span><span>s our high school reunion</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>That guy</span><span> is doing the best out of all of us. He's now a sales manager at Hawke Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Aurora knew, wouldn't she just die of regret?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! With her criminal record, she's not even worthy of serving him. Oh, speaking of which, Aurora isn't in the group chat, so she probably doesn't know about the reunion. Should we invite her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! I'd love to see her reaction when she realizes what she missed out on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter echoed as the two </span><span>women</span><span> boldly ridiculed Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and Ethan heard every single word clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clenched her fists tightly, itching to storm over and slap those two gossiping </span><span>bitches.</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan was holding her back, and she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after the two </span><span>women</span><span> left did Lily finally explode. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ethan, let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan didn't loosen his grip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of her hair as if completely addicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Annoyed, Lily lifted her knee and struck him hard between the legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan groaned in pain, his face twisting in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, are you trying to murder me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him entirely, Lily yanked open the stall door and stormed out, shouting after the two </span><span>women</span><span>, "Hey, you</span><span> bitche</span><span>s, stop right there! I</span><span>'m gonna kill you</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was speechless.</span><br><span>What a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by the time she burst out of the restroom, </span><span>they</span><span> were already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, she marched straight toward the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she arrived, she saw the two </span><span>women</span><span>, dolled up in flashy outfits, standing in front of Aurora, saying something to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to rush over and slap them, but in front of Aurora and Daisy, she had to pretend to be the good girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swallowing her fury, she straightened her clothes and approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could reach them, the</span><span>y</span><span> turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what did they say to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were my high school classmates. They wanted to invite me to the reunion tomorrow. But tomorrow is your birthday, so I declined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Lily finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her biggest worry was Aurora being bullied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she was around, she wouldn't let anyone lay a finger on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora studied Lily's face curiously. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily frowned while responding, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are your lips so red and a little swollen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be from Ethan kissing her in the restroom earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to say she got bitten by a bug, but Aurora obviously wouldn't believe that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she said, "I got bitten by a mosquito earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Ethan overheard and smirked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like that mosquito was considerate, biting both your upper and lower lips. It</span><span>'</span><span>s so symmetrical."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian raised an eyebrow at Ethan but didn</span><span>'</span><span>t say anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had seen through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of them sat around the table. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the birthday cake was brought out, but Lily had no appetite at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bite felt tasteless because of her bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish eating, Julian suddenly spoke, "Ethan, take Ms. Walker back to school later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's head shot up in shock, eyes wide in disbelief while looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, what about you guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already called Daniel. He'll pick us up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily wanted to disappear on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What is Mr. Hawke up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We all came together. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Ethan the only one sending me back?</span></p></div>
