        <h1>Chapter 159 A Hot Potato</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily finally breathed a sigh of relief inside the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked out with her pasta, about to sit next to Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she remembered Aurora couldn't hear, so she changed direction and sat across from her instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, Aurora could easily read her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she ate, Lily casually asked, "Aurora, who was that man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Mr. Hawke's assistant, Ethan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart skipped a beat, and her fork froze mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So he really is Mr. Hawke's subordinate?</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then why was he hanging out with Darren?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of the one million dollars she had scammed from Ethan weighed heavily on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated arrogant rich people, so scamming them had never bothered her conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want to deceive good people, especially those who protected Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily suddenly lost her appetite. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That one million dollars felt like a hot potato, and she just wanted to return it to Ethan as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Aurora finds out I scammed Ethan, she'll be so disappointed in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hung her head low, her emotions in turmoil. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mechanically shoveled food into her mouth, but it tasted like nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Lily helped Aurora clean up the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preoccupied with her thoughts, she spoke very little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, who couldn't hear, was naturally quiet as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen was filled only with the sound of running water and the faint clinking of dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was tidied up, Aurora took Lily into her studio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Aurora spent almost all her time in the studio embroidering, except for eating and sleeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked around at the colorful threads filling the room and then at Aurora, who was completely absorbed in her embroidery. Her heart ached with pity and admiration for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora excels at everything she does.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She even managed to learn such a complex skill while in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And in just five years, she's reached a master level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But if Aurora hadn't gone to prison, her life after graduating from university would have been so much more brilliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily sat quietly, watching Aurora embroider without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat by the window at her embroidery frame, the morning sunlight streaming through and casting a golden glow over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora looks so serene and beautiful while embroidering. If she were dressed in ancient attire, she'd look like a noble lady straight out of a painting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily couldn't help but take out her phone and capture a photo of Aurora embroidering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking the photo, she continued to watch Aurora quietly, but her thoughts drifted far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was busy figuring out how to return that one million dollars to Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she was also thinking about other things.</span><br><span>Aurora said she wants to finish this piece within a year. How am I supposed to save enough money to go abroad in just one year?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and soon it was lunchtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having lunch at Hawke Estate, Lily bid farewell to Aurora and headed straight back to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the afternoon, Aurora continued her embroidery, while Lily attended her classes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sun set, the sky turned a warm orange-red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her classes, Lily received a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man on the other end spoke in an intimate tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily had been irritable all day since seeing Ethan, so her tone was impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spit it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was caught off guard by Lily's coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Samuel was at home. His phone was on speaker mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's voice came through, immediately drawing laughter from Kelson and Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel had a reason for putting the call on speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier that day, their family had held a meeting with one main agenda&mdash;hoping that one of the two brothers would go into business and take over the family company soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren showed little interest.</span><br><span>"I'm a doctor. I have no interest in taking over the family business."</span><br><span>Samuel shrugged.</span><br><span>"I'm still young and want to enjoy life for a few more years. Dad, you're still young too. As long as you're in charge, everything's fine."</span><br><span>Kelson's face turned red with anger.</span><br><span>"A useless doctor and a good-for-nothing slacker. When I'm gone, who's going to take over the business? Don't you need some time to learn the ropes?"</span><br><span>Samuel smirked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, just quit being a doctor. It's exhausting. Being a CEO is way more comfortable. My future wealth depends on you."</span><br><span>Darren shot Samuel a glare. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being a doctor is my calling. I love saving lives, and I know nothing about running a company. Samuel, you should step up. When you're in charge, build a few more hospitals."</span><br><span>"No way. My youth is precious. I'm not wasting it dealing with businessmen."</span><br><span>"Then I'm not doing it either."</span><br><span>The two brothers avoided the topic of business like the plague, neither willing to take charge.</span><br><span>This infuriated Kelson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive company, and yet no one wanted to inherit it.</span><br><span>"If neither of you wants to take over, then get married. Have kids right away. If I can't count on you, I'll train my grandchildren."</span><br><span>At this, Samuel immediately imagined Lily's beautiful yet fierce face.</span><br><span>He couldn't help but swallow hard.</span><br><span>Winning over Ms. Walker is going to be a long and difficult journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he said, "Why go through all that trouble? Dad, you're only fifty. You and Mom can have another kid. Right, Darren?"</span><br><span>Darren nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Samuel's right. Dad, instead of relying on us, you and Mom should get to it."</span><br><span>Kelson was taken aback.</span><br><span>"None of you are taking me seriously. What do you even want?</span><br><span>"Darren, Samuel is still young, but you're almost thirty and don't even have a girlfriend. Tell me the truth, are you gay?"</span><br><span>Darren retorted, "Dad, what are you talking about? It's just that I'm busy with work. I'm not gay.</span><br><span>"Samuel doesn't have a girlfriend either. Why aren't you questioning him?"</span><br><span>Samuel immediately shot back, "I do have a girlfriend. I just broke up with her, okay? I can find the next one in no time."</span><br><span>"You're bluffing</span><span>!</span><span>"</span><br><span>"I'm not bluffing. I may not be good at much, but I'm great with women."</span><br><span>Kelson's eyes lit up. "Really?"</span><br><span>"Of course." Samuel lifted his chin proudly.</span><br><span>Darren, however, poured cold water on his enthusiasm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really have a girlfriend, then make a call and let us hear it."</span><br><span>"Fine, I'm not afraid."</span><br><span>Samuel pulled out his phone, about to call a female friend he was close with, but Darren snatched it away.</span><br><span>Lily's number was at the top of his contacts, labeled "Goddess Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If this girl is Samuel's goddess, she must be someone he likes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Darren dialed Lily's number, flashing a mischievous grin as he put the call on speaker.</span><br><span>Samuel's heart nearly stopped.</span><br><span>He wanted to hang up, but the call had already connected.</span><br><span>Reluctantly, he decided to brazen it out, pretending to be close to Lily. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, did you miss me?"</span><br><span>He thought that, even though Lily was fiery, hearing such an intimate remark would soften her tone.</span><br><span>But to his surprise, Lily replied impatiently, "Spit it out."</span><br><span>Samuel's face turned bright red.</span><br><span>Kelson and Darren both doubled over with laughter.</span><br><span>When they finally calmed down, Kelson shot Samuel a look of suspicion, as if asking, "This is what you call being popular with women?"</span></p></div>
