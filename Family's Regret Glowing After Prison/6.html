        <h1>Chapter 6 Here We Go Again</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora was giving mad side-eye, sweeping her gaze across the room like a boss. Joshua, Celeste, and Bertha were acting sketch, dodging her stare like she was medusa. Even Barnett, who was clearly salty about the whole thing, couldn&#x27;t keep eye contact.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Nobody wants to spill? Fine, I&#x27;ll break it down for you,&quot; she said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Elvador, facts are facts. That dress was pristine when you got it. The security footage will show I didn&#x27;t lay a finger on it during the drive. So if it turned up damaged after Bertha got her hands on it, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to connect the dots.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She planted her feet firmly. &quot;That&#x27;s exactly why you won&#x27;t check the footage, right? Because once that tape rolls, you can&#x27;t pin this mess on me anymore. You can&#x27;t make me take the blame for someone else&#x27;s mistake. We both know that&#x27;s the truth.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Take the blame for someone else&#x27;s mistake.&quot; These words were like knives, slicing straight into Joshua and Celeste&#x27;s hearts, forcing them to face what had happened five years ago.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Celeste&#x27;s tears streamed down her face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Aurora, it&#x27;s not like that. Let me explain. You and Bertha are both my daughters. How could I ever bear to...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Aurora were still the girl she had been five years ago, longing for her mother&#x27;s love, she might have softened at Celeste&#x27;s tearful plea.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, after five years in prison, those words only made her feel sick.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Say whatever you want. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me anymore.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With that, she turned and walked away without sparing them another glance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she passed by Hubery, her heart skipped a beat and her chest tightened. Yet, she didn&#x27;t let it show and kept on going without a single falter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Every step felt like a stab to her own heart. She wanted no interaction with him and just needed to escape this suffocating place as quickly as possible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just as she was about to pass him, his familiar yet distant voice rang softly but firmly in her ear. &quot;Aurora, I believe you didn&#x27;t do it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His words didn&#x27;t comfort her. Instead, they struck her as laughable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing &quot;I believe you&quot; from his mouth felt like the cruelest irony.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She paused briefly, then quickened her pace.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her limp made her hurried steps seem clumsy, almost as if she were fleeing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Watching her retreat, Hubery felt his heart clench painfully as if pierced by countless needles. The ache spread through him, making it hard to breathe.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He wanted to call out her name, but his throat tightened, refusing to let out a sound.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora dragged herself back to her crash pad in the storage room, feeling totally beat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She flopped onto the janky old folding bed, running on empty. The day&#x27;s drama had her straight-up exhausted, like she&#x27;d been hit by a truck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Staring blankly at the wall, she finally accepted that she was finished with this family. Any remaining warmth she&#x27;d felt toward them vanished, leaving only an icy void in her chest. The last three years had been nothing but endless torment—constant disrespect and cruelty that cut deeper than physical wounds. These painful memories had carved themselves permanently into her mind, leaving scars that time couldn&#x27;t heal.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She took a deep breath, forcing herself to sit up and start packing her things.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A glance around the tiny, cluttered space reminded her how little she had. There was barely anything here that belonged to her. The only item she could take was the set of clothes she&#x27;d just changed out of. She stuffed them into a plastic bag.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew it was time to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As she reached for the door, her fingers hadn&#x27;t even touched the handle when it swung open from the other side. Standing there was an older woman, perhaps in her late fifties.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The woman&#x27;s face lit up with joy the moment she saw Aurora. Her voice trembled with excitement. &quot;Ms. Elvador, you&#x27;ve really come back?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Aurora froze for a moment, then murmured, &quot;Daisy?&quot;</p></div>
