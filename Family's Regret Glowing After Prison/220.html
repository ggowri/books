        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, Barnett, Bertha, and Megan were all taken away by security.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those scum gone, Aurora's birthday celebration proceeded smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the video of Bertha pushing Megan down the stairs had been handed over to the police.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Bertha</span><span> wa</span><span>s too young to face charges, but Celeste and Joshua would have to answer for it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barron family was one of Putnam's elite, and while the Carter family wasn't quite on their level, they were still far above the Elvadors.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With pressure from both families, Celeste and Joshua ended up detained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the</span><span> </span><span>footage of Julian pushing Barnett and Bertha down the stairs? It had been deleted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's birthday party was a grand </span><span>event</span><span>. In front of all of Putnam's </span><span>elite</span><span>, Benjamin and Laura introduced her as the Barron family's princess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that day on, everyone knew her, and </span><span>they </span><span>were all </span><span>kind to her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, these folks didn't give her the time of day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, t</span><span>hey treated</span><span> her with warmth and respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides the Barrons, she had Julian, Joe, Oliver, and others backing her up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Oliver's </span><span>little </span><span>sister, Dora Mills, who adored Aurora, flutte</span><span>red</span><span> around her like a butterfly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder my brother keeps praising you! You are as adorable as he said</span><span>, </span><span>like the prettiest flower in the garden."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled in thanks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dora threw an arm around </span><span>her neck</span><span>. "Aurora, when school starts, </span><span>I've got your back. Nobody's gonna mess with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sighed inwardly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweetheart, I</span><span>'</span><span>m about to start college. You</span><span>'</span><span>re, what, ten? I could be your mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she played along, letting Dora have her moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, a</span><span>t just five years old, Aurora was already dozing off before the party even ended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even remember how she got home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she was out cold, chaos exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste? Thrown into detention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elvador Group? Under fire from the top four families in Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they were released two weeks later, the Elvador Group had already gone bankrupt, nearly two decades earlier than in her previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Elvadors weren</span><span>'</span><span>t the only ones to fall. The Carters went down with them, thanks to Megan</span><span>'</span><span>s little stunt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and Laura </span><span>found</span><span> out about </span><span>she tried </span><span>to bully Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Messing with </span><span style="font-style: italic;">my baby girl </span><span style="font-style: italic;">at her party?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Carters clearly don't respect us</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The</span><span style="font-style: italic;">n, the</span><span style="font-style: italic;">y'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">re done</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> in Putnam</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Aurora's previous life, Megan had harassed Julian</span><span> </span><span>until he was twenty-two.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To keep other </span><span>girls </span><span>away, she'd even spread rumors that Julian had sexual dysfunction and a twisted personality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian hadn't cared about the gossip, but her obsession had worn him down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he'd bankrupted the Carters and shipped Megan abroad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around</span><span>, the Carter family's downfall </span><span>came ten years early</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And </span><span>Judy</span><span>? She</span><span> didn't fare much better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Megan's hostility toward Aurora </span><span>was all</span><span> her doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night the party ended, Julian walked into his father and Judy's bedroom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was calm as ever, knife in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson nearly jumped out of his skin at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What </span><span>the hell </span><span>are you doing with that?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> knew</span><span> Julian's ruthless</span><span> side</span><span>. He wanted nothing more than to banish Julian to the old </span><span>estate </span><span>and never see him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian refused to leave, insisting on staying in the main villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, he'd cowed Anderson and Judy into absolute submission.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes were dark, his face expressionless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He toyed with the blade. "Judy incited Megan to hurt Aurora. Cutting out her tongue </span><span>sounds </span><span>fair, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson didn</span><span>'</span><span>t argue. He couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Julian's fathomless gaze, he couldn't muster a single word of protest&mdash;only a numb nod.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian almost seemed to smile, though his expression remained eerily blank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, h</span><span>e tossed the knife at Anderson's feet. "You do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's hands shook as he picked up the blade. He hesitated, pity flickering in his eyes when he looked at Judy, but fear quickly smothered it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's face twisted in terror. "No! You can't do this!</span><span> I'm your wife!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson grimaced. "I don't want to either, but I can't disobey Julian."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I dare refuse, that little monster will cut off my cock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's happened before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night Anderson brought Judy home after his first wife's death, Julian hadn't just pushed Judy down the stairs, causing her to miscarry&mdash;he'd also crept into Anderson's room while he slept and sliced off his cock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it had been reattached, Anderson had lost all virility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That fiend was already this vicious at five. Now he's ten&mdash;he's only gotten worse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, losing your tongue just means you can't talk. But if you resist, you'll lose your life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy thrashed wildly. "Call the police! We need to call the police!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're adults! How can we be afraid of a ten-year-old? He doesn't even have the knife now&mdash;we can </span><span>take him down</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>And then, have him locked up</span><span> </span><span>in </span><span>a </span><span>psych ward</span><span> for life!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson hesitated. Her words made sense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Julian let out a low laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Knew you</span><span>'</span><span>d try something stupid.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, h</span><span>e pulled a lighter from his pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forgot to mention&mdash;I turned on the gas. The whole house is filled with it. If I spark this, what do you think will happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and Judy's faces went slack with horror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you insane?!" Judy shrieked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson nearly wet himself. "Julian, don't be rash! I'll do it right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gas explosion would level the entire villa&mdash;none of them would survive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did I have to father this demon? He's worse than the devil himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, he wondered if Julian was a sociopath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save his skin, Anderson pinned Judy down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judy, don't blame me. You brought this on yourself. Why did you have to provoke Aurora? Megan crossed the Barrons&mdash;her family will be ruined soon enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You'</span><span>re about to pay for it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No!" Judy fought like a wild animal, but she was no match for Anderson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening slice, her tongue hit the floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She howled, blood pooling around her like a dark river.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anderson, you're still as cowardly and stupid as ever. You believed I'd turned on the gas?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'd throw away my life&mdash;and Aurora's future&mdash;just to take you two out?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's eyes widened in dawning terror. "Wh-what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, there was never any gas leak. But you just mutilated Judy&mdash;and that's a felony. Congratulations, </span><span>Dad</span><span>. You're going to prison"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's grin was more terrifying than any nightmare.</span></p></div>
