        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood there, numb, as if Adolph's cries hadn't even reached her.</span><br><span>His heart twisted in agony.</span><br><span>He was consumed with regret.</span><br><span>If he had known that his actions would cause her so much pain, shortening her life and leaving her scarred, he would have never taken that fateful step.</span><br><span>He regretted it deeply.</span><br><span>How he wished he could turn back time. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could, he would do everything in his power to protect her and ensure she never suffered again.</span><br><span>But there were no do-overs.</span><br><span>He had hurt the person he loved most, and no amount of guilt or apology could undo it.</span><br><span>Kneeling at her feet, he grabbed her hand and slapped it desperately against his face.</span><br><span>The sharp crack echoed down the hospital corridor.</span><br><span>Soon, red handprints bloomed across his pale cheeks.</span><br><span>Aurora stood like an emotionless puppet, allowing him to do as he pleased.</span><br><span>Daisy couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t take it anymore. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed forward and shoved him away with all her strength.</span><br><span>Caught off guard, Adolph collapsed onto the cold floor.</span><br><span>Daisy gently lifted Aurora's hand, revealing a palm already red and slightly swollen.</span><br><span>Fury flared in her chest as she glared at Adolph, her eyes filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly feel sorry for Ms. Elvador and want to make amends, then stay out of her life! You know she hates you, yet you keep clinging to her. You're only making things worse on purpose!"</span><br><span>She showed Aurora's swollen hand to him, demanding, "Is this your way of punishing yourself, or tormenting her?"</span><br><span>Adolph's gaze was fixed on that red palm, a searing pain spreading from his chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so overwhelmed with anguish that words failed him; he shook his head helplessly.</span><br><span>His eyes sought Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s, filled with pleas and regret, but she refused to look at him.</span><br><span>A suffocating tightness gripped his chest, leaving him breathless. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was so sharp that he couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t even manage another apology.</span><br><span>Daisy saw his pitiful state and scoffed.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Where was this remorse before?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Who was he trying to fool with this lovesick act now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since getting out of prison, Aurora had tried time and again to prove her innocence to him, but he never believed her, always siding with Bertha.</span><br><span>His so-called love was cheap and revolting.</span><br><span>With one last cold glance, Daisy guided Aurora past him.</span><br><span>Adolph reached out desperately, but his fingers grasped only air.</span><br><span>He wanted to chase after her, to beg for redemption, but his stomach churned violently, and his chest felt like it had been stabbed.</span><br><span>With a heavy thud, he collapsed, his regret-filled eyes fixed on Aurora's fading figure.</span><br><span>"Aurora..." he rasped.</span><br><span>She never looked back, leaving him to wallow in his misery alone on the floor.</span><br><span>Outside the hospital, Aurora walked toward the bus stop, Daisy by her side, lost in a daze.</span><br><span>Before they reached it, her attention was drawn to a trash can beside the stop.</span><br><span>A man with no legs was rummaging through the garbage nearby.</span><br><span>He pulled out a moldy steamed bun and devoured it as if it were a treasure.</span><br><span>His clothes were filthy, his tangled hair matted from neglect.</span><br><span>Long strands of hair fell over his face, hiding most of it as he kept his head down.</span><br><span>Flies buzzed around the trash can, but he seemed oblivious.</span><br><span>Aurora's gaze lingered on his bony frame, a flicker of pity rising in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Life is really unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Some are born with a silver spoon in their mouth, while others are stuck with a rough start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she couldn't see his face, the condition of his skin suggested he wasn't old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still young, yet he had lost both legs, which meant he also lost the ability to live a normal life. Now, he could only scavenge through trash to feed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was autumn now, and the weather was still bearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when winter came, he was in for a rough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at him, she couldn't help but see herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but mock herself.</span><br><span>My life's a mess, and here I am feeling sorry for someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's probably </span><span>because she had struggled through darkness and weathered life's storms that she could better understand others' pain and feel a strong desire to offer them some comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned her steps and entered a nearby convenience store. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bought bread and water, then walked over to the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said gently, "Moldy buns will make you sick. Take this instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held out a paper bag to him, filled not just with bread and water but also some cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept only ten dollars for the bus fare, giving him all the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her voice, the man froze mid-bite, his ravenous eating coming to an abrupt halt. His body stiffened as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat there, dazed, on the ground. Beneath the hair covering his face, his eyes brimmed with fear, panic, shame, and unbearable humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora bent down slightly, gazing at him with kindness, and repeated softly. "Take it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man remained still, as if he hadn't heard her, his body trembling faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora assumed he had been mistreated so often that he was afraid of her, a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She softened her tone even more. "Don't be scared. I mean you no harm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she reached for the moldy bun in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto her slender, pale fingers, and a wave of sorrow hit him. Tears spilled over, one dropping onto the back of her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora paused, her heart aching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself that this man must have gone so long without warmth that even the slightest kindness from a stranger overwhelmed him, bringing him to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Aurora snatched the moldy bun from his hand and tossed it into the trash. Then, she placed the bread, water, and money into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the process, he never looked up or said a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to offer some encouragement, but just then, the bus arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy tugged her arm. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora gave the man one last deep look before boarding with Daisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only as the bus pulled away did he muster the courage to lift his head, revealing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, battered and broken, he had been taken to the hospital by Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Julian's orders, Ethan had instructed the doctors to amputate Hubery's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the hospital, the doctors informed Ethan that Hubery's legs had been smashed to a pulp. His feet and leg bones were shattered beyond repair, with fragments piercing through his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without Julian's command, amputation was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Hubery was wheeled out of the operating room, both of his long legs had been severed at the thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anesthesia wore off, he awoke in excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he had lost his legs, he felt all hope drain away, consumed by despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no money for the hospital bills, they kicked him out after a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wheelchair vanished somewhere along the way, leaving him to drag his ruined body across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For days, he scavenged through trash during the day and slept on park benches at night, living a life worse than that of a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even that misery paled in comparison to the pain of encountering Aurora now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must look hideous. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She didn't even recognize me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He longed to call out to her, to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that wretched state, he couldn't face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery clutched the paper bag tightly, his gaze locked on the departing bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, I was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When will you forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When will you remember me and take me home?</span></p></div>
