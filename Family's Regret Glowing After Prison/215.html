        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestia Palace was the only seven-star hotel in Putnam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To celebrate Aurora's birthday, the Barron family had reserved the entire hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura </span><span>had </span><span>dressed Aurora </span><span>in</span><span> a custom-made pink princess puff dress</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>W</span><span>ith her flawless skin and cute, soft look, </span><span>Aurora </span><span>was like a living doll.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When t</span><span>he four </span><span>of them </span><span>arrived</span><span>, </span><span>Benjamin crouched down to</span><span> </span><span>Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s level, gently patting her </span><span>head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, there are many guests outside</span><span>. I have to play the host, </span><span>so I can't stay with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the guests were </span><span>big shots</span><span> in Putnam, and as the head of the family,</span><span> </span><span>it was his duty to greet them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Aurora had never had her own birthday party before, she</span><span>'</span><span>d seen the Elvadors throw grand </span><span>ones</span><span> for Bertha many times, so she </span><span>knew how it worked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded obediently. "Okay, Daddy. You can go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>eeing how</span><span> mature </span><span>she was </span><span>for her ag</span><span>e, </span><span>Benjamin</span><span> felt </span><span>proud </span><span>but</span><span> a little heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually tough and cold Benjamin </span><span>now </span><span>turned into putty in his daughter's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With reluctance written all over his face, he said, "</span><span>Not</span><span> even a little sad to see me go</span><span>, sweetheart</span><span>? I don't want to leave my </span><span>baby girl </span><span>for even a minute."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even pretended to cry, putting on an exaggerated display of sorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fatherly love is just too overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cupped </span><span>his</span><span> face and </span><span>played along</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"Daddy, you're a grown-up. </span><span>Don</span><span>'</span><span>t</span><span> cry like a</span><span> </span><span>kid, or you won't look handsome anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin sniffled.</span><span> </span><span>"Then I want a big hug to make me feel better."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, </span><span>Aurora felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since joining the Barron family, her days had been filled with hugs, kisses, and over-the-top affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was sweet&hellip; but </span><span>kind of </span><span>overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>till</span><span>, she</span><span> </span><span>gave him </span><span>a tight hug and even threw in an extra kiss as a bonus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, hurry and greet the guests."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now with Aurora's kiss and hug, Benjamin instantly revived and </span><span>then </span><span>handed Aurora over to Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he left, Laura pointed to the grand door in front of them and said to Aurora, "When the birthday party starts, I'll </span><span>walk</span><span> you through this door. </span><span>Y</span><span>o</span><span>u wi</span><span>ll be the shining</span><span> star of this celebration, my dear</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the </span><span>old </span><span>Aurora, this door had seemed like an insurmountable chasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd dreamed so many times that the Elvadors would throw her a party, walk her through this door, and proudly introduce her as their daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet,</span><span> </span><span>it was just a fantasy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvadors had never given her an ounce of love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now here were the Barrons, showering her with everything she'd craved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each kind gesture made her hate her old self more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't stayed in the orphanage for Hubery and had </span><span>just</span><span> agreed to be adopted by the Barrons in her old life, she would have had all this much sooner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No manipulation by the Elvadors. No disability. No drinking poison in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse still, she'd dragged poor Lily down with her, turning her into a</span><span> </span><span>murderer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, Lily is far away from my miserable past</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm sure she'll </span><span style="font-style: italic;">live a normal life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora silently vowed that when she grew up, she would visit Daisy and Lily and make up for everything she owed them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Aurora was lost in thought, Laura spoke again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, sweetie, we've got time before the party. Why don't we chill in the lounge for a bit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mommy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Aurora, Laura, and William headed toward the lounge together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they arrived, Laura turned to Aurora with a serious expression.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>I need</span><span> your opinion on</span><span> something, </span><span>Aurora."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora blinked in confusion. "What is it?"</span></p></div>
