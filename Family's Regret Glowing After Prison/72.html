        <h1>Chapter 72 She Only Has One Kidney</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was curled up on the bed, her face flushed red, her body burning as if she had just been pulled from a furnace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips were cracked, and she </span><span>let out</span><span> low, pained moans</span><span>. At the same time,</span><span> her hands clutch</span><span>ed</span><span> the bedsheet tightly as if the pressure could ease the raging discomfort inside her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice stood helplessly by the side, unsure of what to do. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy were also distressed, their eyes red with sorrow. Seeing Aurora in such agony felt like a blade twisted in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Julian entered, he immediately scooped her up and rushed downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the intense heat of her body, so scalding it seemed as though it might burn him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To the hospital!" Julian said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone hurried downstairs and got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Daisy suddenly recalled something, her voice anxious. "Don't go to Orley Central Hospital, go to Orley Caring Hospital instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elvador family, Hubery, and Adolph were all at Orley Central Hospital. They were all out of their minds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing they needed was for Aurora to run into them. Every time she crossed paths with them, she ended up in misfortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, no matter what, they had to ensure she escaped the Elvador family's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan floored the accelerator, and the car shot forward like a</span><span> rocket</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than twenty minutes, they arrived at Orley Caring Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Darren and his colleagues had just finished their academic conference at Orley Caring Hospital and were preparing to head back to Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked, they discussed the contents of the conference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his usual aloof and carefree demeanor, Darren was, in fact, a key doctor at Orley Central Hospital, highly skilled in the medical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he was frequently invited to represent the hospital at academic conferences and seminars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he and his colleagues were chatting and about to exit the hospital building, Julian rushed past him, holding Aurora in his arms and heading straight for the emergency room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Daisy were hurriedly following behind, breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Darren's steps faltered. A flash of surprise and confusion crossed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively turned to look back, but all he saw was Julian's tall figure growing more distant, the woman in his arms with long hair swaying in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps I have seen it wrong?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">That woman in his arms couldn&rsquo;t be Aurora, right</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span><span> he </span><span>wondered</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orley Caring Hospital was located on the outskirts of Orley, far from the city center. The Elvador family only ever went to Orley Central Hospital in the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, dismissing the thought. Maybe he was too tired lately and had mistaken someone else for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't think too much of it and continued chatting with his colleagues, shifting the topic back to the case they had been discussing earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the emergency room, the doctors quickly began their examination of Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a flurry of activity, one of the doctors walked over to Julian with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you the patient's husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was taken aback by the question. "I'm not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! He is the patient's husband, and I'm h</span><span>is</span><span> grandmother. Doctor, how is my granddaughter</span><span>-in-law</span><span>?" Beatrice </span><span>chimed in</span><span> anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the doctor immediately scolded them, "What kind of family members are you? You know the patient has only one kidney, yet you let her drink so much alcohol? Are you trying to kill her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Having only o</span><span>ne kidney already makes alcohol metabolism difficult, and with the amount of alcohol she ingested, her blood alcohol level is severely elevated." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, the other kidney is in good condition. If it weren't for that, with her frail state, she would have suffered multiple organ failures and could have already died from excessive drinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lucky you brought her here in time before there was irreversible organ damage. However, the situation is still very critical, and we'll do everything we can to save her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Beatrice heard this, she almost collapsed, but Ashley rushed to support her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's eyes widened in shock</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>F</span><span>rozen in place, </span><span>she couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the doctor returned to the emergency room, Beatrice, looking utterly exhausted, turned to Daisy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daisy, how </span><span>come</span><span> Aurora only ha</span><span>s</span><span> one kidney?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, shaken by the news, replied in disbelief, "</span><span>I don&rsquo;t know.</span><span> Ms. Elvador was in perfect health when she was sent to prison five years ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were like a bomb thrown into still water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, Ashley, and Julian all froze, their eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been fine before entering prison but had lost a kidney after her release, it meant that the kidney had likely been removed during her time in </span><span>jail</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a deathly silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian thought back to the information he had seen earlier that morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan hadn't found any details about Aurora losing a kidney, but given everything she had endured over the years, it wasn't hard to deduce that the kidney she had lost was likely taken by the people who had hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of hatred or grievance could drive someone to do this to a girl</span><span> like her</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He prided himself on being ruthless, but even he couldn't imagine being so inhuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wait felt agonizingly long, every passing minute torturing their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice silently prayed, her hands clasped together, hoping for Aurora's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley and Daisy wept quietly, their hearts aching for the girl's suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, the emergency room door finally opened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor emerged, looking worn out, and removed his mask. "</span><span>She&rsquo;s stable now</span><span>, but she'll need to stay in the hospital for observation. We still need to closely monitor her condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone let out a sigh of relief, their tense hearts loosening just a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Orley Central Hospital, Barnett looked disheveled, his face unshaven, eyes filled with exhaustion and an overwhelming sense of regret. The once confident and spirited man was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked toward the room where his father, Joshua, was being treated, his mind elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he reached the door, the female director of the hospital emerged, pulling the door open from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was the heat in the room, but her face was flushed red, particularly her lips, which appeared swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was startled when she ran into Barnett at the door, her eyes shifting nervously, seemingly guilty. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Elvador, you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett casually hummed, his thoughts consumed with Aurora. The tangled mess of worries in his mind seemed to tighten around him, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even spare a glance at the female director and walked straight into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua had sustained injuries to his arm, shoulder, and hip. Although he had lost a lot of blood, none of the wounds were life-threatening, so there was no major concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett walked in, he saw his father contentedly adjusting his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't think much of it, assuming that his father had just finished using the bathroom. He was too overwhelmed to focus on anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a weary expression, he slowly made his way to a chair and slumped down, as if all his energy had been drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned when he saw that and asked, "</span><span>Still haven&rsquo;t found Aurora, that bitch</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's brows immediately furrowed at his father's words, a flash of anger and disbelief crossing his face. "Dad, Aurora is your daughter! How can you speak of her like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua snorted dismissively, "She tried to kill me. I don't have a daughter like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's expression grew even more troubled, his voice edged with frustration. "Dad, </span><span>we still have no idea if she&rsquo;s alive</span><span>. Can you please stop holding a grudge against her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joshua merely sneered, his eyes cold and indifferent, "I'd rather she die out there. That way, I wouldn't have to worry about her causing me headaches every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face immediately darkened. "Dad, no matter what, Aurora is your daughter. How can you not care about her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irritated, Joshua scoffed, "With someone like her, even if she throws herself at Mr. Hawke, he probably wouldn't care. She's worthless. If she dies, </span><span>so be it</span><span>. Why make a big deal out of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved dismissively and continued, "Enough. Forget about her. </span><span>W</span><span>hy don't you find </span><span>some hot chickes</span><span> in Orley </span><span>and bring them to</span><span> Mr. Hawke? If we can keep him happy, our family's cooperation with him will be smooth sailing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood there, stunned, staring blankly at his father. At that moment, the man before him seemed so unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The father he had once looked up to, who had always held a certain authority but was still somewhat kind and loving</span><span>. But now, all he uttered were</span><span> such cold-hearted words</span><span>.</span></p></div>
