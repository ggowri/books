        <h1>Chapter 58 To Orley</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Camille heard Aurora's name, tears welled up in her eyes, and Adolph swallowed hard, the pain evident in his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e couldn't bring himself to believe that Aurora, whom he had always seen as kind and intelligent, could be so cruel. </span><span>Yet</span><span>, Camille's silent grief felt like a sharp blade, continuously piercing his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto Camille's tear-streaked face. He clenched his teeth, his throat tight as if choked, and spoke hoarsely, "Camille, don't be sad. I won't let anyone hurt you again. Even though Aurora has already spent five years in prison for this, it won't be enough to atone for her actions. I... I will make sure you get justice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even as he spoke, his heart felt as though it were being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it wasn't Aurora&mdash;it was Bertha," Camille tried to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears flowed endlessly. She wished, more than anything, that she could speak, even if it was just to open her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was trapped in this immobile body, unable to do anything while misunderstandings continued to deepen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days passed, and that morning, the rain in Orley finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, who had been sitting restlessly in Putnam, could no longer stay still. "Ashley, is it still raining in Orley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's stopped," Ashley said, noticing Beatrice's impatience, a smile playing on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's head to Orley right away. We should aim to get there by noon, so we can meet my grandson's future wife this afternoon." Beatrice grew more excited with every thought. She couldn't wait to meet Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Julian, a man who was as emotionally distant as a stone, had finally found someone to care for, she was certain that Aurora must be a sweet, sensible girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam Hawke, I've packed everything. We can leave right now," Ashley said, supporting Beatrice as they prepared to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them set off immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Beatrice chattered endlessly about Aurora, her happiness evident in the smile that never left her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the joy that filled their hearts when they left was quickly replaced by disappointment once they reached Orley, as Beatrice wasn't feeling well from the journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, in her old age, found it hard to handle the stress. She was exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley noticed the situation and said, "Madam Hawke, maybe we should call Julian and ask him to come pick you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice, ever stubborn, quickly stopped her. "No, no, what if my grandson's future wife sees me like this, all sickly? She might feel sorry for me and start taking care of me. How will Julian and her have time to talk about their future together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley just blinked, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she thinks Julian is some grandma's boy, and decides not to date him, he'll end up alone forever! His stubborn personality could turn him into an old bachelor. He finally has a girlfriend, and I can't let her slip away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley hesitated but didn't argue. "Uh... I won't say forever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to the hospital first," Beatrice continued. "Once I feel better, we'll call Julian. I have to meet my grandson's future wife in the best possible condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley helped Beatrice toward Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the journey, Beatrice kept muttering to herself, "It's my old body's fault. It ruined my chance to meet my grandson's future wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been enjoying the peace these last few days. The wound on her head was almost fully healed, and she was due to leave the hospital. But she wasn't ready to return to that suffocating house. Staying in the hospital for a few more days seemed like a small luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora lay on the bed, her eyes blankly staring out the window, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two nurses entered, preparing to change her bandages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the nurses carefully removed the gauze, Aurora didn't flinch. Her face remained serene, as if she couldn't feel the pain at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past few days, the nurses had grown accustomed to Aurora's endurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While changing her bandages, they chatted casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's truly a miracle," one of the nurses said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would've thought? A vegetable for five years, and she suddenly wakes up," the other nurse replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but it's a pity that she's awake yet still can't move," the first nurse said with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if she has regained consciousness, it's only a matter of time before she fully wakes up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True..." the other nurse agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Aurora suddenly turned her head sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurses were startled. "Did we hurt you? You'll be fine in a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora locked her eyes on them, her voice trembling with urgency. "The comatose patient you're talking about&mdash;her name is Camille Sherwood, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eh? How do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it was Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille had regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did this mean she could clear her name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora suddenly let out a laugh, though the laughter quickly dissolved into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter, mingled with sobs, startled the nurses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" one of the nurses asked, her voice filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just happy," Aurora replied through her tears. "I'm so happy for that comatose patient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurses exchanged confused glances but didn't probe further. They finished changing her bandages and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's tears flowed freely, her heart torn in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five years of false imprisonment, the constant suffering&mdash;she had borne it all alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Camille awake, it felt like a light had broken through the darkness, offering a glimmer of hope to clear her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a deep breath, Aurora made up her mind. She had to see Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she got out of bed, Daisy walked in with a thermos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face lit up with excitement. "Daisy, Camille is conscious! She can prove that it wasn't me who pushed her off the balcony at Bertha's party five years ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's eyes widened in shock. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Aurora nodded eagerly. "I just heard the nurses talking about it. I need to see her right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Daisy hesitated, concern flashing in her eyes. "Ms. Elvador, you know how the Sherwood family feels about you because of this incident. If they find out you're visiting Camille now, they might think you have ill intentions toward her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze, the reality of the situation suddenly dawning on her. She hadn't considered that angle in her rush to get to Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, her eyes widened as another thought struck her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Bertha know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Camille could prove her innocence, Aurora couldn't let anything happen to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bertha was another matter entirely. She was the one who had pushed Camille, the one who didn't want her to wake up. If Bertha found out Camille was awake...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to see Camille now, even if Adolph misunderstood. She had to convince him to take Camille home where she would be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille could not be left in Bertha's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With urgency in her voice, Aurora turned to Daisy. "Daisy, it was Bertha who pushed Camille. If Bertha finds out Camille is awake, she will hurt her again. I have to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated but saw the determination in Aurora's eyes. Reluctantly, she nodded. "I'll go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they rushed toward Camille's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at Camille's room, they were stopped by a man standing outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart dropped when she recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Elvador family's driver, the same one who had taken her to the auction the other day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been Bertha's personal driver for nearly two decades, ever since Bertha started kindergarten, as Daisy had once told her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him standing there meant only one thing&mdash;Bertha was inside.</span></p></div>
