        <h1>Chapter 117 Lily's Target</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold, calculating smile spread across her face, one that others might miss if they </span><span>weren't paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no qualms when it came to dealing with arrogant people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw Aurora being betrayed by the Elvador family, Lily understood one crucial thing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You're better off relying on yourself than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by growing stronger could you stand tall in this world, untouched and unbowed, never at the mercy of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora, wait for me.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I've saved up enough, I'll take you and Mom far away from Orley, to a place where no one can find us. We'll start fresh, a whole new life</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily swore to herself, her resolve hardening as she turned and headed back to her dorm, her steps firm and decisive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From behind the thin door of the dorm, the sound of laughter cut through the air, harsh, mocking, and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She just left. She won't be back so soon. Let's hurry up and get this over with before that crazy woman comes back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little bitch</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>Her mom&rsquo;s a nanny, yet she&rsquo;s</span><span> acting all high and mighty. I've had enough of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>She&rsquo;s got nothing to lose. What can we do about her?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the worst part. If we can't touch her, at least we can mess with her stuff. Let's use her toothbrush to scrub the toilet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll use her towel to wipe my feet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I poured toilet water into her shampoo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words were venomous, filled with nothing but spite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes narrowed dangerously, cold as a predator stalking its prey. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of anger, there was a strange thrill in her, like she was about to sink her teeth into something delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the rumors about her being a rich man's mistress started spreading, her reputation at Orley University of Technology was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Barnett stepping in, she'd have been expelled by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lily didn't feel the need to thank him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't an idiot. From the moment the rumors started, it was clear Barnett was behind it, probably to pressure Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was despicable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since then, the people who once pretended to be friendly with her had turned into wolves, using their family's status to bully her without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always kept to herself, too quiet and too soft for anyone to think she'd fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Aurora go through all that made Lily realize just how dangerous it was to rely on others. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since high school, she had become a porcupine, prickly, defensive, and unafraid to fight back when threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared to push her would find out just how far she'd go to defend herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned back against the cold wall, arms crossed, her expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes, she could hear the rustling of her roommates cleaning up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what they'd been doing. Her toothbrush had been used to scrub the toilet. Her towel was dirty from their feet. Toilet water had been poured into her shampoo and shower gel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's clean up and head to the cafeteria," one of her roommates said, the sound of things being packed following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the noise died down, the click of the door hinge echoed down the hall, freezing the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily pushed the door open slowly, her lips curling into a twisted smile as she leaned against the doorframe. "Having fun, are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls froze, their faces going pale. The sight of Lily's strange, almost mocking grin made their hearts race, their minds going blank in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked in, Lily locked the door behind her with a soft click.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound made the three girls' blood run cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the girls, the first to recover from the shock, nervously stammered, "You... you came back so early? We were just cleaning up for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's smile deepened, but it was anything but comforting. It sent chills down their spines, like the snap of ice in the dead of winter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really like my </span><span>stuff</span><span> </span><span>that much? If you do, just say the word. I'll give them to you," she said, her voice soft, but with an unyielding pressure that made it clear there was no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls exchanged confused glances, fear rising in their chests. </span><span>They all wondered w</span><span>hat</span><span> Lily </span><span>was </span><span>planning</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could respond, Lily's finger pointed toward the bathroom, her voice as cold as frost. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go in. I want to see you use my toothbrush, shampoo, shower gel, and towel to wash yourselves clean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogant postures they had earlier were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-No, we'll use our own stuff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's smile vanished in an instant, replaced by an icy expression. "I'm not asking</span><span> for your opinion</span><span>. I'm telling you</span><span> to do so</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, she pulled out a butterfly knife, the blade gleaming coldly in the light as she twirled it with practiced ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the knife sent a jolt of fear through the girls, their faces turning ghostly white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You... don't do this. We</span><span>&rsquo;re sorry</span><span>, okay? Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's eyes flicked to the knife, and with a casual flick of her wrist, she grinned. "</span><span>You&rsquo;re sorry</span><span>? You think an apology will make it all go away? </span><span>If so, I&rsquo;ll be damned</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember what I said two months ago?</span><span> </span><span>You can bully me all you want, but I can take your lives. One life for three. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of that cold, ruthless threat hit them hard, and they began to sob in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Lily's cold stare, they had no choice but to comply, like animals led to slaughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by step, they walked into the bathroom, using her toothbrush to brush their teeth, her shampoo to wash their hair, and her towel to wipe off the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stood by the door, watching them the whole time</span><span> with a smirk</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is how it should be</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span> She huffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, you couldn&rsquo;t put an end to bullying simply by dodging it. You had to strike first</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily knew it by heart. And it looked like she had to hit the bar tonight and find that guy with the Maybach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed money, and the easiest way to get it was from men like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she felt no guilt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across the hallway of Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan raced here in his car, switching into a crisp white coat and blue mask, leaving only his sharp eyes exposed. With purpose, he walked straight into Joshua's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua was lounging in bed, thinking it was just another routine check-up when the doctor walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely glanced up, distracted by his phone as he flirted with Isabella, a sly grin creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan's anger flared as he watched this disgusting man. Without a second thought, he marched up to Joshua and shoved a dirty sock straight into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua's eyes went wide in shock, and he reached for the sock, but Ethan's hands clamped down like a vice, yanking his arms back with a sickening crack as he dislocated his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain hit instantly, nearly knocking Joshua out. His face twisted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ethan didn't stop there. He hammered a series of blows into Joshua's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sickening sound of breaking bones echoed in the room as Joshua's legs, just recently set, snapped under the force of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was too much for him to bear. He struggled briefly, then passed out from the sheer agony, his body going limp in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his rage spent, Ethan felt a strange sense of relief, like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exhaled deeply</span><span> and was</span><span> </span><span>about to leave</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>W</span><span>hen </span><span>he turned around to see Darren standing in the doorway, </span><span>he stared</span><span> </span><span>at him with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being reckless. There's a security camera in here," Darren said, his brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan raised an eyebrow, his gaze defiant. "So, Dr. Lowell, what are you gonna do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren glanced at Joshua, his face battered and bruised, then gave a small nod. "You need to leave. I'll handle the cameras."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan walked over and clapped him on the shoulder. "You're a good guy. Drinks are on me tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, as the night unfolded, the city came alive with lights and energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men were deep in drinks at a bar, oblivious to the world around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Ethan, the alcohol was a way to numb the rage boiling inside him after dealing with the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Darren, it was a way to drown the guilt he felt for all the cruel things he had said and done to Aurora. Every harsh word and every snide comment all came rushing back, and he hated himself for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed, and before either of them realized it, they were both heavily drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan was still on his feet, though unsteady, while Darren had passed out on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What neither man knew was that Lily had been watching them from a corner of the bar for a while now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ethan stumbled out, Lily's eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked straight up to Darren, who she recognized as a friend of Barnett. He was the one who'd mocked Aurora more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger flared up. Without a second thought, she slapped him hard across the face. The sharp sound of the slap rang out in the quiet bar, leaving a bright red mark on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a cold snort, turned on her heel, and went after Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, anyone close to Darren was just like him</span><span>. So, Ethan must be</span><span> </span><span>a friend of Barnett's, a guy with no moral compass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them were the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the bar, she spotted Ethan standing on the curb, loosening his tie and taking off his glasses, trying to cool down in the night air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was handsome in a refined, almost delicate way, exactly her target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked over to him, offering him an umbrella with a cautious, almost shy look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was soft</span><span> as she uttered,</span><span> "Sir, your umbrella."</span></p></div>
