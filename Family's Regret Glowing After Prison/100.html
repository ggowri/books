        <h1>Chapter 100 Pay for That</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's face turned ghostly pale in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, in her heated rage, she had only wanted to humiliate Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, facing Julian, it felt like someone had dumped a bucket of ice water over her head. Her feverish mind snapped back to reality, and all her previous arrogance vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thoughts raced through her mind as she tried to think of excuses, but her throat felt gripped by an invisible hand, leaving her unable to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her eyes met Julian's razor-sharp gaze, a chill ran from her toes to the top of her head. His look alone made her feel like she was about to be torn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy forced a weak smile and stammered, "Mr. Hawke..." Her voice came out strained and shaky through gritted teeth. "Today is Beatrice's day. I was trying to liven things up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women who had helped Judy hurt Aurora finally realized the gravity of the situation, and they smiled nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, we were just joking around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's right..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian didn't even spare them a glance. His gaze moved past them to the battered figure lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's clothes were practically in shreds, with bruises covering her exposed skin. Her face was so swollen it was barely recognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair was spread out messily on the floor, matted with blood and tears, creating a heartbreaking sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her condition, Julian recognized her instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed as his breath caught in his throat. The shock on his face quickly transformed into blazing fury, his gaze intense enough to burn everything in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly removed his expensive tailored suit jacket, draping it over Aurora's battered body with urgent yet gentle care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian scooped Aurora into his arms without hesitation and instinctively tightened his grip to hold her securely against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke!" Someone gasped, taking a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood there with their jaws dropped, watching the normally germophobic and unapproachable Julian wrap his clothes around a blood-covered woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's clenched jaw cast a cold shadow under the pearl chandelier's glow. As he bent his long legs, still clad in his suit pants, Aurora's dark red blood immediately began seeping into the expensive fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the collective gasps filling the ballroom, Aurora suddenly twitched in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her blood-matted eyelashes fluttered open with effort, and her unfocused eyes found his grim face. She managed a broken smile and whispered, "Mr. Hawke... have you come to save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words pierced his heart like an ice pick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's arms tensed instantly as Adam's apple bobbed twice. He pulled her even closer to his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," he answered softly, as if afraid his voice might startle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his sweat-soaked shirt, he could feel the prominence of her shoulder blades, which made her seem even more fragile and pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's icy gaze swept across the room like a sharp blade, finally pinning Judy down like a nail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's head started spinning, and her vision went dark as her legs turned to jelly, nearly collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... She..." She stammered, her lips trembling, unable to form a coherent sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lock down the premises," Julian commanded, his voice as cold as ice. "No one leaves until I return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone involved should consider if their body parts are worth the price of hurting someone under my protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ethan reached for his radio, Judy lunged forward with a piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had finally realized the gravity of the situation and was all too familiar with Julian's methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawke, please listen! That bitch seduced your father first! That's why I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seduced?" Julian let out a chilling laugh. "It seems you need another lesson..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He advanced toward her, forcing her to back up against the dining table. "About distinguishing truth from lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like when I taught you the difference between a miscarriage and a hysterectomy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's perfectly styled curls were now plastered to her forehead with cold sweat. Animal-like whimpers escaped her throat as her manicured nails tore through the tablecloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian carried his companion toward the side door, leaving drops of blood scattered across the black marble floor. Each step seemed to fray everyone's nerves even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thick eyelashes cast dark shadows as he glanced down, then suddenly turned to Beatrice, who sat pale-faced in the main seat. "Grandmother, I'll need to borrow your silk shawl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice's heart ached as she watched the girl she had considered family being oppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly removed her cloak and handed it to Julian, saying, "With Grandma here, anyone who dares to bully Aurora won't get away with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," Julian grunted in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightly wrapped the dark red silk shawl around Aurora, completely covering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against the crimson silk, her exposed ankle looked startlingly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deathly silence, Julian carried Aurora straight out of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door slowly closed, the last ray of light cast a harsh shadow across Judy's distorted face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ears were ringing, and her face had grown paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally realized she had misunderstood something, and this misunderstanding might cost her more than she could bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Anderson with pleading eyes and shrieked, "Anderson, that woman is your mistress!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's face darkened as he frowned. "What nonsense are you spouting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy screamed at him like a mad woman, "How is it nonsense? I saw the photos your mother sent you of her, and you said you'd agree to anything as long as your mother approved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family just thinks I'm barren, so you found someone younger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it my fault I can't have children? It's clearly&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"SLAM!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice slapped her hand on the table, deliberately cutting off Judy's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never liked Judy&mdash;not one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands trembled angrily as she spat, "I sent it to Anderson because I wanted him to see Julian's future wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit like a thunderbolt, leaving Judy completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The socialites who had helped Judy hurt Aurora were now shaking in their designer shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were screwed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolutely screwed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Julian now ran the Hawke Group with an iron fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was common knowledge that Julian showed no mercy. Anyone who crossed him met a terrible fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally understood the chilling meaning behind Julian's warning about "considering the value of their body parts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ballroom erupted into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The socialites who had participated in the assault turned pale as sheets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They begged Beatrice to let them leave, but she wouldn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they think they could walk away after attacking Aurora?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their husbands learned what had happened, they ragefully turned on their wives with raised fists. The scene descended into mayhem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian hadn't specified their punishment yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this waiting game only amplified their terror to unbearable levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy trembled uncontrollably like a leaf in the wind, her mind filled with images of Julian's cruel methods of torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson's heart softened at the sight of her distress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how grave her mistakes were, she was still his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, she had only struck someone younger than her. While it wasn't right for an elder to hit her daughter, it wasn't such a serious offense that required severe punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson sighed and approached Beatrice, saying, "Mom, today is your 80th birthday. We should keep the peace. You know how Julian can be hot-headed sometimes. Let's not get caught up in his drama."</span></p></div>
