        <h1>Chapter 155 A Full Body Examination</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, Aurora underwent a full battery of tests, with Daisy by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She handed the results to the doctor, a seasoned professional with over thirty years of experience. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew more serious as he examined the papers, his brow furrowing deeper the longer he studied them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Aurora stepped out of the office. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were hollow and lifeless, as though her soul had been drained, leaving her devoid of all energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's words echoed in her mind, each one a sharp blade piercing her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How does someone so young end up with a body in this condition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been malnourished for years, your blood and energy levels dangerously low. Combined with old injuries, your body has been pushed far beyond its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, you</span><span>'</span><span>re missing a kidney. That</span><span>'</span><span>s left you weak, and it</span><span>'</span><span>s dragging down your other organs as well," the doctor said, shaking his head.</span><br><span>Daisy spoke up, her voice tight with worry.</span><br><span>"Doctor, if we replace the missing kidney and take good care of her, can she improve?"</span><br><span>He sighed deeply. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It</span><span>'</span><span>s not that simple. Years of weakness and hidden damage have already caused permanent harm to her organs.</span><br><span>"As for her ears, if it were just a ruptured eardrum, we could fix it. But her auditory nerves are irreparably damaged. Even a cochlear implant won</span><span>'</span><span>t help. And with prolonged hearing loss, it could begin affecting her speech.</span><br><span>"Regarding her leg, even if we reset it, she</span><span>'</span><span>ll never move like a normal person. At best, she might walk without a limp, but she</span><span>'</span><span>ll never be able to move quickly."</span><br><span>The doctor continued, each word feeling like a blow to her already battered spirit.</span><br><span>Aurora understood now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooked meat can never be fresh again.</span><br><span>No matter how hard she tried, her broken body would never heal.</span><br><span>She couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t marry, have children, or even experience intimacy like a normal woman.</span><br><span>"Doctor, how long do I have with my body like this?"</span><br><span>The question weighed heavily on her, but she had to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're well taken care of, maybe four or five years," he replied.</span><br><span>Four or five years?</span><br><span>That meant she might not even make it to thirty.</span><br><span>Aurora stumbled forward, her body feeling as though it carried the weight of a mountain. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each breath stabbed her chest.</span><br><span>Daisy followed closely behind, her eyes welling up with tears from heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Elvador, don't give up. Medical science has advanced so much. If hospitals in Orley can't help, we'll try elsewhere," Daisy pleaded.</span><br><span>Aurora kept walking, limping with each step, unresponsive.</span><br><span>Then it hit Daisy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora could no longer hear any sound.</span><br><span>Tears spilled instantly.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When had she lost her hearing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daisy hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t come today, she wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t have even noticed.</span><br><span>Watching Aurora</span><span>'</span><span>s fragile, thin frame, Daisy clamped a hand over her mouth, trying to stifle her sobs. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the tears wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop.</span><br><span>Just yesterday, they had struck back at those who had hurt Aurora.</span><br><span>Yet now, Daisy felt no satisfaction from that revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No amount of revenge could bring the girl's health back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and sorrow overwhelmed Daisy, but she was powerless to help Aurora. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sense of helplessness filled her heart.</span><br><span>"Aurora!" A deep male voice suddenly called out.</span><br><span>Daisy quickly wiped her tears and looked up, seeing Adolph in a hospital gown, his face pale, blocking Aurora's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was there because the night before, after learning the full truth, he had been hit harder than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back home, he drowned himself in liquor until alcohol poisoning set in, and his parents rushed him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined he would run into Aurora at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching out, he grabbed Aurora's frail shoulders, his eyes red as he asked, "Aurora, are you here to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's hollow gaze slowly focused. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she recognized Adolph, unmasked disgust flashed across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't even stand the sight of you," she said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's face turned ashen, his lips trembling. "Do you hate me that much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I hate you! I wish you'd just die!" she suddenly shouted at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for them, she wouldn't be this crippled shell of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart felt like it was being ripped apart, bleeding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't gone to prison back then, she would have gotten into Vertar University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years later, she would have graduated smoothly and landed a decent job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she met Julian, she wouldn't have to feel so inferior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had finally found someone she liked, but she wasn't worthy of him, nor could she be with him for the long haul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Aurora's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is my life so miserable?</span><br><span>She almost wished she had never met Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, she wouldn't ache so much over losing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the point of revenge if her life was still a wreck?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, don't ever show up in front of me again. I really despise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words stabbed Adolph like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phrase "I despise you" looped in his mind like a curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged forward, pulling her into a fierce hug as if he could meld her into himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't do this to me, please.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really like you. Hit me, yell at me, anything; just give me one last chance, I beg you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shoved against him, but he only held tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, you got your revenge yesterday. My debt to you is paid. Let's start over. I swear I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Believe me, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice cracked, thick with sincerity, as if he would rip his heart out to prove it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Aurora didn't care for his remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's spilled can't be scooped back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shattered mirror never fits back together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life was ruined, beyond repair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go, Adolph," she said, her tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I won't." Adolph clung to her stubbornly, as if holding on meant there was still hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter smirk flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got something to show you. Let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph hesitated, then slowly released her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what is it?" he asked, hope flickering in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, she slapped the thick stack of test results against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph frowned in confusion but took them, flipping through page by page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened as he scanned through the results. His breathing grew ragged, and his hands shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! This can't be real. I don't believe it," he muttered, but tears betrayed him, falling freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs gave out, and he dropped to his knees before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached up, gripped her slender waist tightly, and sobbed uncontrollably, "Aurora, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't look down at him or catch his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even without looking, she could guess he was apologizing again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unfocused gaze drifted to the end of the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People passed by, staring curiously at them, but she didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm dying soon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's there to care about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph, seeing no reaction from Aurora, looked up and saw her lifeless, hollow expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight nearly broke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he grabbed her hand and struck it against his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, hit me," he pleaded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it makes you feel better, hit me as hard as you want."</span></p></div>
