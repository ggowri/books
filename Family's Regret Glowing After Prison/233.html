        <h1>Chapter 233 Epilogue: Aurora 27</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha shot her mom, Isabella, a </span><span>smug </span><span>look and spoke up, "Mom, if I get her kidney, will I finally kick this sickness?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella, decked out in surgical scrubs, gently tucked Bertha's hair behind her ear and flashed a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetie, don't you worry. With me in charge, you'll be back on your feet in no time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bertha's face clouded over with worry. "Mom, if we yank her kidney out, won't she call the cops?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella waved her concerns away with a sneaky smirk. "Chill out. Once we're done, Joshua will sell her off to some far-flung foreign country. She'll be in a whole different world, and there's no way she can point the finger at us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That seemed to do the trick, and Bertha finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the anesthesia started to work its magic, her eyes fluttered shut, and she drifted off into dreamland.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella sauntered over to Aurora's motionless body, scalpel in hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wicked grin spread beneath her mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bitch</span><span>! It's </span><span>all your fault</span><span> that</span><span> Celeste treated my girl like dirt for over a decade. Today, I'm settling the score."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scalpel glinted under the bright surgical lights as it inched closer to Aurora.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella was so eager that she didn't even bother to sterilize Aurora's body before going in for the kidney.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of the moment had her blood pumping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the scalpel was about to break Aurora's skin, the operating room door slammed open with a deafening crash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A team of cops, guns at the ready, charged in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze! Drop the knife and raise your hands!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden intrusion caught Isabella and the other medical staff completely off-guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella's heart raced with panic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why are the cops here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One officer promptly kicked Isabella to the floor and slapped the cuffs on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest quickly rounded up her accomplices.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police chief dashed over to Aurora's operating table. Seeing her safe, he let out a huge sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't arrived just in time</span><span>, Aurora would've been in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if anything happened to her, his job as chief would be history.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming, he whirled around to Isabella and smacked her across the face. "How dare you kidnap our country's brilliant scientist and try to harvest her organs? You're playing with fire!</span><span> </span><span>Do you have any clue what'll happen if she gets hurt?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On top of kidnapping, you've pulled off illegal organ harvesting. That's practically a national security threat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These combined offenses were enough to land Isabella a death sentence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella stammered, "No, I didn't</span><span>. </span><span>I'm being wrongfully accused!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you're being wronged will be determined at the station. You're coming with us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isabella and the medical team involved in this illegal operation were swiftly taken away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bertha, still under anesthesia on the table, was not spared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they exited the operating theater, Isabella noticed Joshua, the fool who had partnered with her, was also being led away in handcuffs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized in horror that their chances were officially gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all taken back to the police station for interrogation, including Barnett, who had sent them signals. He too found himself in handcuffs, facing the repercussions of his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora finally regained consciousness, she found Celeste sitting by her bedside, worry etched across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, how are you feeling?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat up on the hospital bed as the effects of the anesthetic started to wear off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mental haze cleared, and she became fully aware of the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, she looked at Celeste. "Thanks for stepping in this time. Let's call it quits on our old beef."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's eyes widened in surprise. "Aurora, you're finally ready to let bygones be </span><span>bygones?</span><span> </span><span>Does that mean you'll stick around and come home with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora kept her cool. "Ms. Jerome, I think you're getting the wrong idea. I'm just burying the hatchet from our past. I never said I'd go home with you or recognize you as my mom.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you remember? My last name's Barron now, not </span><span>Elvador</span><span>. I've got my own mom, dad, and a brother. Why would I go back with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face fell. "Aurora, I'm your real mom! The Barron family snatched you away from me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a scoff. "They didn't snatch me. I just don't need you anymore.</span><span> </span><span>You probably don't know this, but the Barron family once came to the orphanage with the intention of adopting me. But I shot them down because I didn't </span><span>wanna</span><span> leave Hubery.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking back, I really kick myself for that decision. If I'd said yes to the adoption back then, I'd be living the dream, surrounded by love from my parents and brother. Instead, I went back to the </span><span>Elvador</span><span> family and ended up getting the short end of the stick with your abuse.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste wilted under her words, looking like a deflated balloon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I'm sorry. I know I messed up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut it out," Aurora interrupted, clearly fed up, "I've heard you apologizing for a million times in the past, and every time, you'd just go right back to being your old self. You've lost all your street cred with me. Let's not waste our breath on empty words; it's a real drag."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's bluntness left Celeste with no room to make excuses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face went as white as a sheet out of shame. "Okay, I'll zip my lip."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick silence settled over the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't stand being in the same space as Celeste. She was feeling okay now and was itching to get out of there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After</span><span> she</span><span> </span><span>spent </span><span>six months at the research institute, it had been a long eight years since she'd last laid eyes on her parents and brother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was chomping at the bit to head home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eight years have gone by. They probably won't even know me anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought, Aurora swung her legs off the bed, slipped on her shoes, and started making her way out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste jumped up from her seat. "Aurora, where are you headed?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back to Putnam to see my parents," Aurora replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt a twinge of jealousy. She was Aurora's flesh-and-blood mother, yet Aurora spoke so fondly of others.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, Aurora..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was running out of patience and didn't want to look at Celeste for another second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste bit her lip, trying to collect her thoughts. "Aurora, could you maybe write a forgiveness letter for your brother?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a cold laugh that rang through the room. "He teamed up with others to steal my kidney, and you're asking me to write him a forgiveness letter?"</span></p></div>
