        <h1>Chapter 63 Proving Her Innocence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was shoved aside by Adolph, stumbling a few steps before managing to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille, seeing this, was beside herself with worry. She gripped the bedsheet tightly, desperate to tell Adolph the truth, to expose Bertha's wrongdoing, to defend Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her throat felt tight, as if something was lodged there, and the words were stuck, unable to escape. Every attempt to speak turned into a painful sob.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze darted between Aurora and Adolph, her heart twisting in anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had done nothing wrong, yet she had been falsely imprisoned for five years, while the real culprit roamed free and nearly killed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, despite everything, Adolph misunderstood her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, Adolph had loved Aurora. How had it all changed? Now, she was nothing more than an enemy in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille wanted to scream, to break through this barrier of silence, but her body wouldn't obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she tried, the harder she cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph watched this in agony, his heart aching. He only wanted to lash out, to release the anger that threatened to consume him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he couldn't hold back anymore, his fury now directed at Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, what have you done to Camille? Why can't she speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, too, was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille had woken up, just as Aurora had hoped, and now it seemed like the truth was within reach. Yet, Camille cried and said nothing. Not a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, speak! Tell them! Tell them I didn't push you, that I didn't choke you&mdash;everything was Bertha's doing! Please, Camille, say something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Adolph snapped, his eyes burning with fury as he stared at Aurora. He wanted to hate her, but his heart betrayed him. The pull between love and hatred tore him apart. His pain was palpable. "Camille's terrified, and you're still pretending to be innocent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille cried uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't shout at Aurora. He shouldn't hurt her anymore. One day, he would regret this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was so much Camille wanted to say, but all of it was lost, swallowed by the chaos of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with tension, the atmosphere unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to the doctor, desperate. "Doctor, why can't Camille speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor performed another quick examination. Other than some bodily weakness due to years of being in a coma, there was no physical issue. He reassured them, "It's normal. After being in a vegetative state for so long, Camille's language skills may take time to recover. With rehabilitation, she should be able to speak again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That explanation lifted some of the tension in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Aurora, it was like a blow to the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could wait, but Bertha wouldn't. She knew Bertha would do everything in her power to harm Camille before she had a chance to fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything happened to Camille during this time, Aurora would once again be the prime suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what it took, today, she had to uncover the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora turned toward Bertha, and sure enough, she saw Bertha's relief. Her eyes darted back and forth, clearly plotting her next move against Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clenched her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bertha, today, you will regret everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind raced, and the next moment, a plan formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora walked toward Camille, about to put her plan into action. But before she could speak, Adolph blocked her path, his eyes full of warning. "Aurora, what are you doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora met his gaze, her eyes resolute. "I know how to make Camille reveal who really put her in a coma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph froze, unsure whether to trust her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Barnett suddenly approached, grabbing Aurora's arm. "Aurora, stop with your nonsense. Camille's fine now. Just calm down, and we won't press charges for nearly strangling her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery walked over as well, sighing deeply. "Aurora, after everything that's happened, it's time for you to grow up. Apologize to Camille and Bertha, and let's move on. Today's events can be forgotten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared coldly at her older brother and childhood friend, her disgust palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a CEO, the other a lawyer&mdash;both educated, both well-off. Yet, when it came to Bertha, they acted like idiots. It was infuriating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm just looking for an excuse to create trouble? Is that it? Are you so afraid of me exposing Bertha's fake goodness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora!" Barnett snapped, his voice rising. "Don't push it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was louder than his. "You shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery opened his mouth to speak, but Aurora whirled on him, glaring with fire in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shut up too. You have no right to lecture me, no right to stop me from doing what I need to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Hubery's faces turned pale, their pride bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had seen Aurora lose control before. If this kept up, they'd be the ones to look foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora shoved Bertha toward Camille.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Camille saw Bertha, she went pale and started shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of hate and fear, almost radiating off her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fool could see Camille couldn't stand Bertha&mdash;no sign of friendship there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph frowned, sensing something was seriously off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, what's going on?" he asked, his voice tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Aurora sneered. "She's seeing her enemy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, stop slandering Bertha," Barnett chastised her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not slandering anyone. You'll see the truth soon enough." Aurora's gaze was unwavering, her confidence undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Camille, her voice soft but determined. "Camille, I know you can't speak right now, and I don't need you to speak. Just blink once for yes, twice for no. I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to confirm or deny it. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Camille blinked once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curled into a smile, a sense of satisfaction washing over her. It was the relief she had been waiting for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Bertha, today is your end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha's heart hammered in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started to struggle. "I don't feel well. I need to see a doctor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora ignored her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, seeing Bertha's attempts to break free, helped Aurora keep her under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Aurora's voice rang out, strong and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camille, five years ago, at that party, was it me who pushed you down the stairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camille's gaze was filled with guilt, but without hesitation, she blinked twice. Just like that, the truth was out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Aurora?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It really wasn't her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For five long years, he had believed Aurora was responsible for hurting Camille, and his hatred had consumed him. He'd gone to any lengths to punish her, to make her pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Camille's unambiguous response, everything he had known&mdash;the entire truth he had clung to&mdash;crumbled before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands balled into fists, his heart a storm of confusion and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Aurora hadn't done anything to harm Camille... then what had all the suffering, all the rage, been for?</span></p></div>
