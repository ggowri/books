        <h1>Chapter 212 Aurora's Epilogue VI</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze.</span><br><span>Damn that little brat. How can someone so young be so terrifying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first entered the Hawke family with her pregnant belly, Julian had pushed her down the stairs. Her baby was lost that day. And not only that&mdash;somehow, Julian had arranged for a doctor to remove her uterus, ensuring she could never have children again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this five-year-old dared to threaten her with a knife. She had endured five years of Julian's presence. At ten, Julian was much calmer than when he was five, but the cruelty that lay beneath still made him every bit the monster he had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy couldn't even bring herself to meet Julian's eyes, afraid that if she did, he might charge at her with a knife. Without a word, she forced a smile, then turned and fled to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression remained icy, but when he glanced back at Aurora, all the anger faded, replaced by the innocent warmth of a shy boy. He resumed cutting fruit, placing it into the juicer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, leaning over the counter, rested her chin on her hands, watching him with eager eyes. Julian, feeling her gaze, couldn't help but feel embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the juice was ready. "Aurora, try it," he said, handing her a glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's face lit up with delight as she eagerly took a sip, her eyes widening in surprise. "Wow! This juice is amazing, Juli! It's the best I've ever had! You're so great. I knew you were the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, flustered by her praise, didn't know how to react. Since his mother's death, no one had ever praised him so genuinely and warmly. Over the years, he had grown distant and cold, only ever softening towards Beatrice. To everyone else, he remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that his heart, frozen and detached, could never be warmed again. But now, facing this little girl who had only just entered his life, he cared so much and felt so drawn to her. He didn't understand why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, he reached out and gently ruffled Aurora's soft hair. "If you like it, drink more. I'll make it for you every day, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora nodded enthusiastically. "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He really is a good person. Whether as a child or an adult, he has always been warm-hearted. I feel like all my luck in life has been used up just to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drained the glass of juice in one go, placed it down, then opened her arms wide and hugged Julian tightly around the waist, snuggling against him with complete dependence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden action once again made Julian's ears turn red from embarrassment. "Aurora, I should take you back. Your family must be wondering where you are," Julian said, though in his heart, he didn't want to be apart from Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only sending her away because he was worried about what Judy might do to her.</span><br><span>That woman truly hasn't learned her lesson. Once I return Aurora safely, I'll make sure to teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Julian was burning with anger on the inside, he still wore the innocent, harmless big brother look in front of Aurora.</span><br><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Barron Estate, when Aurora returned, she found William sitting on the couch with a frown, looking angry. He didn't look happy to see her and turned his head away with a huff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him upset, Aurora sighed. She had been so excited to see Julian in the garden that she hadn't thought about William's feelings. She skipped over to him and sat down beside him, tilting her head to look at him. "What's wrong?" she asked, pretending not to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William ignored her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare she ask what's wrong? I'm upset because, with Julian around, she has completely forgotten about me. I don't understand what's so special about Julian. Or is it that Aurora likes cold, distant guys like Julian? If that's the case, I could be like that too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pouted, waiting for Aurora to comfort him. But after a while, she still hadn't said anything. Curious, he turned to look at her, only to meet her sparkling eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him seriously and asked softly, "Are you jealous because I went home with Juli?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face immediately turned bright red. "Who said I was jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not," William said, stubbornly refusing to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora grinned. "I knew it. You are jealous. Don't worry, you're the only big brother in my heart. You'll always be my one and only brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As for Julian, he isn't a brother. He is going to be my future husband. In my past life, I had treated Barnett like a brother, but he never cared. So this time, my one and only brother is William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William felt his heart melt with sweetness. Her words made him smile, forgetting all about how she had just run off with Julian. But being the proud person that he was, he still tried to act tough. "I don't care." With that, he happily stood up and hurried upstairs, almost as if he was escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in his room, he threw himself onto the bed, rolling around with joy.</span><br><span>She really does like me the most. Joe, Oliver, and Julian won't be able to steal her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait, I can't let those three guys find out how amazing Aurora is. If they know that my five-year-old sister is a genius, they'll cling to her like stubborn pests. The only downside to having such an amazing sister is that I can't attend the same school and protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William alternated between feeling elated and then down, his emotions a confusing mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Aurora knocked and entered his room. "Are you hungry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William quickly sat up and saw Aurora holding a plate of pasta. It was garnished with parsley and drizzled with olive oil, the aroma of the olive oil mixing with the pasta making his mouth water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be mad, okay?" Aurora had made this dish especially for him. Though she was small, standing on a stool in front of the stove and making a plate of pasta wasn't difficult for her. Her favorite food was the pasta that Daisy made, and she had learned the recipe from Daisy herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William cleared his throat and said, "Considering your sincere apology, I'll accept it this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his smug little expression, Aurora held back a laugh. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, charmed by her, couldn't help but smile broadly, almost grinning from ear to ear. He sat up straight at the table, picked up a fork, and took a bite of the pasta. The pasta, still hot, burst with flavor in his mouth. William couldn't help but exclaim, "Wow, this is so delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled, "I'm glad you like it. I'll make it for you more often."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William froze, unable to believe what he had just heard. He looked at Aurora, his voice trembling. "Did you make this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." She nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, William put down his fork and grabbed her hand. "Did you burn yourself? Aurora, you're so small. How could you be in the kitchen? It's dangerous there. Even if you wanted to apologize to me, you shouldn't have done something so risky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault," he continued, his voice softening. "I shouldn't have gotten mad at you. I was wrong. Can you forgive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Aurora hadn't been burned, the thought of her so young in the kitchen, cooking, made William's heart ache.</span><br><span>She has grown up in an orphanage, probably enduring a lot of hardship, which is why she knows how to cook. But she is only five&mdash;just a little kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the more his heart hurt. He bent down and gently blew on her little hand. "Is it hot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the concern in his eyes, Aurora's heart softened. In her past life, she had been so kind to the Elvador family, pouring out her heart for them, but she had never received true affection in return. They had never cared for her. They always took everything she did for granted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had a brother who truly cared for her. She was so glad she had been adopted by the Barron family. It had been the best decision of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head. "Don't worry. I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, don't do that again. You're not allowed in the kitchen from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span><br><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Barron family enjoyed a warm moment, the Hawke family was facing a much darker scene. After Julian sent Aurora home, he returned to his room, grabbed a knife, and pushed open Judy's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, lying on the bed and scrolling through her phone, was startled when she saw him. She sat up in panic. "What... what do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, his face dark and cold, was a far cry from the innocent boy he had been with Aurora. "You were about to throw Aurora down the stairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy immediately started shaking her head in fear. "No! Mr. Hawke, you misunderstood. I can explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explain?" Julian said, leaning casually against the wall, casually twirling the fruit knife in his hand. The glint of the knife's blade reflected on his face, adding an air of danger to his otherwise youthful features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy was afraid of him being like this. She had seen Julian like this before. She knew the consequences of angering him. He could be merciless when he wanted to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pleaded, "I was just playing with the little girl. Kids like to be hugged, right? I was just going to hug her. It's not what you think. I swear, everything I'm saying is true. If I'm lying, may lightning strike me. Mr. Hawke, please believe me. I've changed. I've been good these past five years. You've seen it with your own eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that everything?" Julian's voice was calm, but his eyes were like a bottomless abyss, and they seemed to pull Judy in. The look in his eyes was so dangerous that it made her knees buckle with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "You... What are you going to do? I'm your stepmother. You can't hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stepped closer to her with the knife still in his hand. "I gave you five years. You still haven't learned your lesson. It seems like you've forgotten everything from five years ago, but I'll make sure you remember it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, no," Judy gasped, nearly losing control of herself in fear. She tried to run, but the room was too small, and there was nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Julian was small, his movements were fast, and he was immediately in front of her. Without hesitation, he raised the knife and plunged it into Judy's thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy screamed in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scream echoed throughout the Hawke Estate. The servants heard it but didn't react, as they were used to it by now. They had witnessed Julian's ruthless methods with Judy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Julian was small, his methods were cruel. However, as long as no one provoked him, Julian's mood remained stable. He didn't lash out at the servants, making him an unexpectedly good master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams continued, one after another. The servants paid no attention, calmly going about their tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bedroom, Judy lay in a pool of blood, her legs punctured by several stabs from Julian's knife, blood pouring from the wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stood in front of her, looking down at her from above. Despite the blood, he remained calm and expressionless, taking out a clean white handkerchief from his pocket. Slowly, he wiped the blood from the knife. "Shut up. You're being too loud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy instantly fell silent, even though the pain was excruciating. She dared not scream again. The pain in her legs was unbearable, and tears involuntarily streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Julian finished wiping the knife clean, he tossed the bloody handkerchief onto Judy's face. "This is just a small lesson. If you ever try to harm her again, I promise the next knife won't be aimed at your legs, but at your neck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's eyes filled with fear. She hated it.</span><br><span>Why does the Hawke family have to have someone like Julian? He is just a child, yet so bold, and more frighteningly, he understands the law, which gives him the confidence to act without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy clenched her teeth and, summoning what little courage she had, said, "Aren't you afraid she'll find out about the killer inside you? That little girl seems so innocent. If she knows about your dark side, do you think she'll still want to be around you? Julian, I'm waiting for the day she despises you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's eyes darkened with a cold, deadly glare.</span><br><span>Aurora is so sweet and innocent. I can't let her see the real me. If she did, it would surely frighten her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, "If you dare say anything to her, I'll cut out your tongue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy immediately shut her mouth, pressing her lips tightly together.</span><br><span>Julian is a madman and a psychopath. He always follows through on his threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered coldly, leaving Judy's bedroom with the knife in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his own room, Julian stood by the window, staring out at the vibrant city below, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the door to his room suddenly burst open. "Julian, you ungrateful brat, who gave you permission to attack her? I swear, you need some discipline. You're asking for a beating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Julian's father, Anderson. Without saying a word, Anderson raised his hand to strike Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained unfazed, calmly lifting the knife in his hand. "If that slap comes down, I guarantee you'll lose that hand. Want to try it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson froze, his hand suspended in midair, his face turning an angry shade. "You ungrateful son, do you have any decency left?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A son's disrespect is the father's fault. If I'm undisciplined, isn't that normal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Anderson pointed at Julian, unable to say anything in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian narrowed his eyes. "If you have nothing else to say, get out of my room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson, nearly enraged to death by his son's insolence, growled, "At your age, you're already like this? I can only imagine what you'll be like when you grow up&mdash;probably a murderer. I won't deal with you. The law will take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, there's no need to trouble," Julian replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson stormed out, and once back in his room, he rushed to pick up Judy and take her to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Judy realized that Anderson hadn't even bothered to seek justice for her, her resentment grew stronger. A sinister thought crossed her mind. She recalled Megan from the Carter family who had always admired Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If that arrogant girl finds out that the person she likes has been taken by another little girl, she'll definitely not let it slide. Julian, if you care about that little brat so much, then I'll make sure someone teaches her a lesson.</span></p></div>
