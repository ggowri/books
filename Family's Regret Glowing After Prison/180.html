        <h1>Chapter 180 Ethan Feels Sorry for Lily</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm begging you... Please, we really can't eat anymore," James begged, his voice cracking and shaky. His cheeks bulged with cake, and cream oozed from the corners of his mouth, mixing with tears in a total mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily let out a cold laugh that chilled everyone to the bone. "Now you're begging? Too late for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, she flicked her butterfly knife and drove it straight into the side of James' thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" James screamed and collapsed to his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was so intense that his vision blurred, but he didn't dare stop chewing the cake. He could only whimper through his full mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stared in terror, robotically shoving cake into their mouths while cream smeared across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chewed painfully, silently crying as tears cut trails through the frosting on their cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The private room echoed with the sounds of chewing, retching, and sobbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily strolled casually around the room, butterfly knife in hand. Anyone who dared disobey got a quick slash&mdash;she was like the Angel of Death making her rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan stared at her, barely recognizing the woman before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Lily was nothing like the person he'd first met. Back then, she'd seemed like an innocent, sweet little kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who'd have thought that sweet-and-innocent routine was just smoke and mirrors? Truth was, she was a cobra lying in wait - mess with her or Aurora, and she'd strike with zero mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily watched them eat like she was enjoying a perfect performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when they'd demolished every bite and sprawled out on the floor in a food coma did she finally give that satisfied nod and bounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside Grand Hotel, Ethan caught up with her. </span><span>"Lily, you got class later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" Ice dripped from every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't done your birthday yet. Come over tonight? I'll throw you a little party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily met his puppy-dog eyes, then looked away. "Hard pass." She turned to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan snagged her wrist. Lily frowned at him, "What now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you always so cold to me?" Ethan whined. "Back when you thought I was gay, fine, whatever. But now? What's your deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily laughed bitterly to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Because there's no future for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm leaving the country soon with Aurora and my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd never been the type to dive headfirst into relationships or hand her heart over to a guy without thinking twice. Only lovesick idiots made that mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's disaster of a relationship was still fresh in her mind. She absolutely refused to put herself in such a vulnerable position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that love crap was just hormones anyway. Given enough time, even the hottest passion fizzled out to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was gone, she figured her feelings for Ethan would be yesterday's news. After all, </span><span>countless hot guys and exciting adventures were waiting</span><span> for her abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why settle for one guy when there's a whole world of options waiting for me?</span><br><span>That was what she kept telling herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd never share any of this with Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she said coolly, "It was just a fling. Don't make it a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused briefly before adding, "Ethan, you should keep your distance from me. Don't forget, I'm not exactly a good person. I've killed before. The cops might connect the dots sooner rather than later. Hanging around me isn't going to do you any favors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily yanked her hand away from Ethan's grasp. She had a lot to sort out before leaving the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her main priority was dealing with everyone who'd ever hurt Aurora. Even if she got caught in the end, at least Aurora wouldn't have to worry about those scumbags anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan watched her stubborn figure walk </span><span>away,</span><span> his eyes filled with pain for her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. </span><span>Elvador</span><span> might be worth it, but you shouldn't throw your whole life away for her," he murmured, his words lost in the breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be such a promising student with a bright future. Why was she so determined to turn herself into this cold-blooded avenger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her crimes ever came to light, she'd be completely ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan wanted to pour his heart out to Lily and tell her everything he was feeling, but he knew it wouldn't change a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily cared more about Aurora than she did about herself. She'd sacrifice her own life for Aurora without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ethan felt a twinge of jealousy toward Aurora, mixed with a hint of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was just a bystander in all this, yet she'd become so fierce, even extreme, because of Aurora. So why couldn't Aurora, who was actually involved, find the courage to stand up to her toxic family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her, even Lily's birthday had been ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lily walked farther away, Ethan couldn't hold back anymore. He called out after her, "Lily, next year on this day, I swear I'll throw you the biggest birthday party ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily froze in her tracks, a strange wave of emotion washing over her, but she still couldn't bring herself to look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan had no idea that by this time next year, he'd never get the chance to </span><span>see</span><span> </span><span>her</span><span> again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that day, life seemed to settle back into a strange new normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day after school, Lily would show up at Grand Hotel right on time, playing the role of a merciless taskmaster as she supervised the group in the private room, making sure they ate every last bite of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suite 101 wasn't just any VIP room&mdash;it was totally decked out with everything from a spacious dining area to a lounge and bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without those facilities, the group would've turned the place into a disgusting, stinking garbage dump within days since they were basically living there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This past month had been absolute hell for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were forced to eat cake until they were sick, but the moment anyone threw up, Lily would turn into a complete demon, forcing them to eat their own vomit. </span><span>So</span><span> they had no choice but to fight through the nausea, not daring to get sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each person had to devour an entire five-layer cake every single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under this brutal regimen, they all ballooned up like they were being inflated, gaining weight at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stella and Cynthia's crew had once been total knockouts with hourglass figures to die for. They'd all maintained healthy weights and obsessed over their appearances like their lives depended on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one month later, though, their weight had skyrocketed like something out of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rapid weight gain left their bodies covered in horrific stretch marks. These weren't typical lines. They looked like ugly centipedes crawling across their skin, way worse than the stretch marks pregnant women got right before delivery. The sight was genuinely disturbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't just become overweight&mdash;they'd transformed into unhealthy, bloated versions of themselves. Some had even developed diabetes. Any trace of their former beauty and confidence had completely vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guys weren't doing any better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>James, who used to be the campus heartthrob at six feet tall and a fit 180 pounds, had ballooned to almost 300 pounds in just a month. His whole body had turned into a shapeless mass, wiping out his once good looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's situation was even more pathetic. He'd been heavy to begin with, but now he resembled nothing more than a human beach ball. He couldn't even stand up anymore and just sat there on the floor like a sad pile of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the sorry state they were in, Lily finally felt some of her anger start to melt away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold, cutting laugh, Lily said, "Since you didn't cause any serious damage to Aurora, I'll cut you some slack this time. But if you ever mess with her again, you won't be so lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys had seen Lily's brutal methods before, and they knew better than to push back. They immediately started groveling, promising to clean up their act and swear off any plans to mess with Aurora ever again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily just smirked and told them to get lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being locked up for a month, James, Gavin, and the rest of the crew were scared out of their minds. They were way too terrified to even think about revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood perfectly well that Aurora had Julian&mdash;a seriously powerful protector&mdash;backing her up. With the Hawke family's massive influence, any attempt at retaliation would be nothing short of suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cynthia was different. She wasn't the type to just let things go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always prided herself on her looks and body, but now, everything was gone. Her perfect appearance&mdash;once her greatest weapon for attracting wealthy men&mdash;had been completely destroyed. Now she was left with nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes burned with pure hatred. Lily was too dangerous to take on directly right now, so she'd focus on her real target&mdash;Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, Julian and Lily, you two care so much about Aurora, huh? Just wait until I tear her down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I bet that'll shatter your hearts. You'll be wrecked when I'm through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark, twisted laugh escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lily! Aurora! You both better watch your backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm coming for you, and I won't stop until I make you pay.</span></p></div>
