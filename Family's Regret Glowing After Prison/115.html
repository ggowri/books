        <h1>Chapter 115 Sinister Plot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan rubbed his tired eyes and asked, "Daisy, who's at the door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Dr. Lowell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Lowell?" Ethan frowned, clearly puzzled. He turned toward Julian, silently asking for clarification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had already recognized Darren's voice. His expression remained indifferent as he said, "Let him in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words left his lips, the front door was pushed open with force. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren strode in, clutching a thick folder in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp gaze swept around the room as he searched anxiously for Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she?" he demanded, his voice edged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy hesitated before replying, "Dr. Lowell, Ms. Elvador is still resting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wake her up," Darren said without missing a beat. "I need to talk to her. It's important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's face tensed with unease. Instinctively, she looked at Julian, silently seeking </span><span>his opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze turned icy as he locked eyes with Darren. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was calm yet carried an unmistakable authority. "If this is about the Elvador family's bankruptcy, you can leave. I'll handle it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren bristled. Nothing irked him more than Julian's perpetual arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time they met, Julian exuded an overpowering presence, </span><span>making</span><span> it impossible to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had seen his fair share of influential figures in Orley, but a man like Julian, young, wealthy, handsome, and effortlessly commanding, was in a league of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had thought Adolph and Barnett were already at the top among their generation. But compared to Julian, they were nothing. The gap was too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lifting his chin defiantly, Darren refused to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were the one who pushed the Elvador family into bankruptcy, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused before adding with a smirk, "Aren't you afraid Aurora will hate you for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the living room shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, Ethan, Daisy, and even Ashley all turned to look at him </span><span>as if he were a fool</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their stares, Darren felt an odd discomfort creeping up his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly forced down his unease and muttered internally, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Who am I kidding? The Elvador family did nothing but make Aurora suffer. If anything, she might actually be glad they went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to speak to Aurora. This is really important."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian remained seated on the sofa, completely still, his eyes locked onto Darren with an unwavering intensity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was sharp and unblinking, as if silently warning him that unless he explained himself fully, he wouldn't be allowed anywhere near Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren felt the weight of that gaze, and with no way out, he reluctantly offered a sliver of information. "I might know something about the kidney she's missing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze sharpened instantly, his eyes dark and piercing like a hawk locking onto prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan, who had been struggling to stay awake, snapped to attention, sitting up straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy and Ashley's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Beatrice, who had just come downstairs for breakfast, stopped in her tracks. Her cane nearly slipped from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian wasted no time. "Daisy, get Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Daisy could even take a step, she froze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was already standing at the top of the staircase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stood still, her entire body tense as if she had been struck by lightning. Her hands clenched tightly by her sides, fingers trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was a mix of shock and disbelief. The pain of losing a kidney had never just been physical. It was a scar that had been carved deep into her soul, one that had never healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a year, she had been left in the dark. She didn't know who had taken her kidney, nor where it had ended up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, out of nowhere, Darren had brought her a clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, she descended the stairs. Every step felt unbearably heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped in front of Darren, her face pale as a sheet. Her eyes locked onto his, filled with desperate urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without warning, she lunged forward, gripping his arms so tightly that her nails almost dug into his skin. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren," she choked out, her voice trembling. "Are you telling the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath hitched as she tightened her grip. "Tell me. Who took my kidney? Who has it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren winced at the pain but didn't pull away. Seeing her so shaken, he softened his tone. "Calm down first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora couldn't calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet when her frantic gaze met his, something about his steady expression forced her to take a deep breath, swallowing the panic rising in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's heart clenched at the sight of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had suffered too much. Even as an outsider, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Julian's calm voice broke through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, come here." His tone was gentle, almost soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora, her back to him, didn't hear a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian froze for a second, then realized she couldn't hear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got up, walked over, and gently took her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth of his touch made Aurora instinctively turn around. When she saw Julian's lips moving, he was saying, "Don't rush. Let's sit down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still dazed, Aurora followed him to the sofa. Her eyes stayed locked on Darren, unable to look away for even a second, afraid of missing something vital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren sat opposite her, cleared his throat, and did his best to keep his voice steady. The weight of the moment made his words come out tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, I know you want answers, but this is more complicated than you think. I don't know who took your kidney, or whose body it's in now.</span><span> </span><span>But one thing's for sure. Someone had their eye on it long before you ever ended up in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused and opened the folder, carefully spreading out a few documents on the coffee table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at this. Is it a kidney-matching test you did eight years ago? I need to know why you did it, and who took you to the hospital for that test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's hands shook as she reached for the papers. Her gaze skimmed over them, her heart pounding faster with every word she read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw the date, eight years ago, her eyes widened in shock. It felt like an electric jolt ran through her body. Her whole frame stiffened as if the earth beneath her feet had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eight years ago, after she had returned to the Elvador family, her parents had told her they were taking her for a routine health check-up at Orley Central Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the only full-body exam she'd ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had been thrilled, thinking her parents, who had never shown much care, were finally taking an interest in her well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day was filled with tests, so many she couldn't remember the specifics. But one thing stood out: the blood test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the pieces clicked into place. It wasn't concern that had led them to bring her to the hospital. It had all been part of a cruel, calculated plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had brought her back just for her kidney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit her like a punch to the gut. Her body trembled uncontrollably, her eyes burning with a mix of shock and a rising wave of rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight... eight years ago, the day after I came home, Mr. and Mrs. Elvador took me to Orley Central Hospital for a full check-up," she stammered, her voice quivering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... it was for a match test? They planned this from the start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could handle their indifference, their lack of love. It was all she had ever known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to think they had treated her like an object, a source of organs to be harvested... That she couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes reddened, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room went quiet, everyone feeling the weight of her pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The usually composed Julian, who rarely let anything rattle him, now radiated an unmistakable, cold fury</span><span>. He was</span><span> on the verge of exploding, his anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen his fair share of wrongdoers, but nothing had ever struck him like the Elvador family's callousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the midst of his fury, Julian kept his head clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief, heavy pause, he spoke with chilling precision. "Who in the Elvador family was hospitalized a year ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes shifted to Darren, waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Not one of them was hospitalized last year... But Bertha was studying abroad. She only came back this year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze turned sharper, filled with an unspoken threat. He didn't believe in coincidences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can find out </span><span>whether</span><span> </span><span>she returned last year or not."</span></p></div>
