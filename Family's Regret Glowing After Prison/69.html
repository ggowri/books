        <h1>Chapter 69 Her Embroidery Pieces</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at him, her eyes devoid of any emotion, like a stagnant pool of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she slowly lowered her legs, turned around to face the man, and her voice was hoarse, as if it had been scraped by sandpaper. "Since you don't want to intervene in my fate, why do you care about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian took a drag from his cigarette and slowly exhaled a ring of smoke. The smoke drifted upward and dissipated into the air, and his gaze fell on Aurora through the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Life is like a play. Sometimes, with one more audience, the plot can change. I just want to see what would happen if you didn't die today. How would this play unfold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora froze. The man in front of her had remained calm from the beginning, his expression cold to the point of indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether others lived or died, he seemed indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it was precisely this cold, detached person who, with those words that seemed less like advice and more like observation, stirred something in Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would want to die if they could live?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If life could be played out beautifully, who would want to ruin it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes darkened. "My play has already been ruined. There's nothing left to watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, however, was unconcerned. "That's not necessarily true. The most exciting part often comes at the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora fell silent. She lowered her head to look at her body, covered in scars, as if contemplating his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she looked up again, a faint light in her eyes. "Do you think I can start over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? If you want to, you can start over anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart was filled with mixed emotions. Julian's words felt like a ray of light in the darkness, shining into her despairing world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a cold wind blew past, and Aurora couldn't help but shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian noticed, took off his black coat, and handed it to Aurora. "Put it on. You'll catch a cold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hesitated for a moment but then took the coat from him and draped it over her shoulders. A faint smell of tobacco and his warmth washed over her, bringing a sense of comfort she hadn't felt in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really want to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Aurora looked at him, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought you wanted to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was a bit dazed. "Ah... yes, I do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were wide open, like two jewels filled with puzzled stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her bewildered expression, Julian's deep, cold eyes softened slightly, and a hint of amusement flickered beneath the surface. Even his lips involuntarily curved into an almost imperceptible smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you embroider?" His voice was still cold, but it carried a subtle, irresistible charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was puzzled. How did he know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian tilted his chin toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora hesitated for a moment and then slowly lowered her head, and her gaze landed on the chest area of the suit jacket, where a flower had been embroidered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flower was exquisitely stitched, the petals layered and vivid, almost lifelike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this her embroidery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly looked up, astonished, staring at Julian in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them locked eyes. Though neither of them said a word, everything was conveyed in the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You embroidered this flower well," Julian said, pulling out his phone and showing her a photo. "This piece of embroidery is elegant, a true masterpiece. Unfortunately, the embroiderer didn't finish it completely. If you could complete it, I'll consider it a thank-you gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, the embroidery was breathtaking. The stitching was delicate, and the colors of the silk thread were perfectly matched. Each stitch seemed to carry life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flowers bloomed, their petals layered and radiant. The color from the center of the flower bled outward, and the edges of the petals were finely stitched, blending seamlessly. The veins of the leaves were embroidered so finely that one could almost imagine the breeze rustling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overall piece was dignified and magnificent, showcasing an air of royalty. It was nearly perfect, except for the fact that it was incomplete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's pupils contracted when she saw the piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This... this was the one she had embroidered in prison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't finished it because she was released from prison before she could complete it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did her work end up in his hands?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, how did you come by this embroidery?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bought it at an auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An auction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her embroidery had sold at an auction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned. When she was in prison, the guards praised her embroidery skills, but she didn't realize how good her work really was. She had always thought her skills were just a bit better than the others in the prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never imagined that something she had embroidered could be worth so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora clutched Julian's phone tightly, her voice trembling. "May I ask... how much did you pay for this piece?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian keenly noticed the change in her emotions and looked at her with an inquisitive gaze. "Twenty million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the piece was worth more than 20 million dollars. It was far more valuable than another one that had been bought for 30 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the one he had bought was incomplete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it was finished by another embroiderer, it would still lose some of its value, as the techniques of the two would differ.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flowers embroidered on his suit jacket almost resembled those in the incomplete piece. If Aurora were to finish it, the differences would likely be indistinguishable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her embroidery could sell for 20 million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's shock was like a raging sea, crashing over her again and again in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened, and Julian's words, "twenty million dollars", echoed in her mind. The number struck her like thunder, shattering her previous understanding of her embroidery skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her amazement, Aurora's fingers trembled and accidentally clicked on the screen of Julian's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo slid, and another piece of embroidery appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bird in the picture looked so lifelike it seemed ready to take flight. The tree branches were detailed and vivid, each line of the bark showing strength, and every intricate detail demonstrated the embroiderer's exceptional skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was stunned once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also her work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's voice remained indifferent. "This one, I bought for 30 million dollars last year as a birthday gift for my grandmother. She loved it. So, this year, I bought another one from the same embroiderer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard the price of "thirty million dollars", Aurora felt as if she had been frozen. Her eyes were wide open, and her mouth slightly agape, as if she wanted to say something, but the overwhelming shock left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And thirty million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were numbers she had never dared to dream about, yet this was the price her embroidery could fetch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder, in prison, those inmates never harmed her hands. No wonder the guards always watched over her whenever she embroidered. It turned out that her hands were worth so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the initial shock, a wave of immense sorrow surged in Aurora's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known, if she had known that her work was worth so much, she wouldn't have suffered so much for just 10 million dollars at the Elvador Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Past grievances and resentment surged up like a tide, and Aurora's eyes began to redden. She bit her lip, trying to suppress the emotions rising within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more she suppressed, the more the frustration poured out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora collapsed against the railing of the bridge, crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was momentarily at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-eight years old, this was the first time he had seen a woman cry in front of him, and it troubled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing, he pulled out a cigarette and offered it to her. "Want one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked up, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to comfort me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't like smoking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned for a moment, but quickly relaxed, perhaps afraid she might misunderstand him as being impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parted his lips slightly. "How about I treat you to a drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sobbed, "Will drinking make it stop hurting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll drink, but I have no money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I'll treat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was taken aback by the sudden compliment. He didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A good person? It was the first time anyone had described him like that.</span></p></div>
