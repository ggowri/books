        <h1>Chapter 54 Legally Speaking</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart was filled with nothing but sarcasm and indifference as she watched Celeste play her little game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made her sick to her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just last night, Celeste had mercilessly smashed an ashtray over her head, a cold, vicious look on her face. There hadn't been a hint of worry, not even a sliver of remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had left her to bleed out on the floor, uncaring if she lived or died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here she was, pretending to be a concerned mother? It was all too fake, too much of an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's disdain was palpable, and it twisted at Celeste's heart. She could feel the sharp pain in her chest as she spoke, "Aurora, I swear I was wrong. Please, just forgive me one last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aurora didn't respond, Barnett quickly stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, Mom was impulsive yesterday, but she regrets it deeply. She couldn't sleep all night, searching all over Orley for you. We're family. Blood is thicker than water. Look at her&mdash;she's terrified of losing you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't bring herself to believe a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett claimed they'd been searching all night for her, but they looked well-rested, without a trace of exhaustion or the weary signs of a sleepless night. No, they must've slept just fine, only noticing she was missing at the crack of dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't woken up from the coma last night, if Daisy hadn't found her and carried her to safety, if she hadn't been rushed to the hospital in time, Aurora knew the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That she'd be dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her survival was a stroke of luck, not due to any concern from the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even glance at them, her face impassive, giving no sign that she was affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt a cold shiver run through him at the sight of her indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't like this&mdash;this dead silence, this empty look. He would rather she yelled, screamed, or threw a tantrum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least then, he'd know she still cared about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with her cold, emotionless stance, it was as if she had shut them out entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled in Barnett's chest, and the words spilled out before he could stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want from us? Tell us! How are we supposed to make things right? Since you got out, it's been nothing but one problem after another. The whole family has been nothing but kind to you, forgiving, patient&mdash;but you're never satisfied, always causing trouble. Why did Mom do you last night? Because you threw a tantrum at the banquet and humiliated us in front of everyone. You wouldn't apologize to Bertha when we got home. You wouldn't stop. You think you can just do whatever you want and not face the consequences? Mom did nothing wrong. She actually gave you a good lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curled into a faint sneer at Barnett's tirade. Her eyes remained as cold as ever, her heart untouched by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that arguing with them was pointless. Over the years, she had learned that, in this so-called family, the truth didn't matter. They only cared about Bertha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need to explain herself. It wouldn't change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Daisy, who had been eavesdropping just outside, could no longer stay silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed into the room, shoving past Celeste and Barnett, and walked right up to Aurora's bed, slamming a thermos onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy's chest heaved with emotion, her eyes bloodshot with anger and heartbreak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the kind man who had helped them last night, Aurora would be dead by now. Dead from her injuries, or worse, from infection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had woken up, and yet she hadn't eaten a thing or drunk a drop of water. And now, the Elvador family wasn't showing any concern&mdash;no, they were here to berate her while she was still recovering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this how family acted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy had held her tongue for as long as she could, but now her morals wouldn't let her stand by and watch Aurora endure this kind of torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one with a sense of right and wrong could do nothing in the face of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even have a conscience?" Daisy's voice wavered with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what Aurora's been through all these years? In prison, she was beaten black and blue. Did any of you visit her? When your father lashed her, did anyone stop him? Mrs. Elvador, you've always favored Bertha, forcing your own daughter to mutilate herself to pay you back for your kindness. Can any of you even begin to understand what she went through? About what you just said&mdash;being kind, forgiving, patient with her? You know that's nothing but a lie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face drained of color. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but no words came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood frozen in shock, his eyes darting between Daisy and Aurora, but Aurora's expression remained cold, unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You claim to love her, to care for her. But every time she's hurt, what do you do? You blame her! You never ask what she's been through, you never listen to her pain. You've never cared about her! You call this love? Beating her, forcing her into submission&mdash;this is how you show love?" Daisy's voice shook with emotion, her eyes red as she fought back tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a warmth surge in her chest as she watched Daisy defend her, but it only made her heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years, only Daisy had ever truly cared for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gently patted Daisy's hand, signaling for her to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need to get upset over people who didn't deserve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste seemed to snap out of her stupor. Her voice trembled with a mix of guilt and defensiveness. "How can you say that? We've always done what's best for Aurora. She's just too stubborn, always causing problems..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Best for her?" Daisy's anger exploded into bitter laughter. "You think you've done what's best? Look at her! Look at what you've done to her! You've never treated her like your daughter. You've favored Bertha for years. You've ignored Aurora, neglected her, and now you've even tried to break her spirit! How is that love? If you didn't want to love her, fine! But you didn't have to hurt her so badly. You're her mother, and yet you've been the one to crush her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste stared at Aurora, panic spreading across her face as she realized what Daisy was saying. Aurora didn't even spare her a glance. Instead, her gaze was locked on Daisy, full of gratitude. At that moment, it was clear: Daisy was the only one she truly trusted. To Aurora, Daisy was the mother she had never had, and Celeste&mdash;her biological mother&mdash;was nothing but a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She no longer cared about the Elvador family. All the longing for a family that she once had was completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The painful memories flooded back to Aurora: the times she had tried so hard to win Celeste's love, the times she had been ignored and rejected. Every single moment felt like a thorn in her heart, twisting deeper with each passing memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Celeste forgot even how to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that Aurora truly no longer cared about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't argue, didn't make a scene. To Aurora, they just no longer mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste finally broke down, tears streaming down her face. "Aurora... I'm sorry... I'm really sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's lips curled into a bitter smile. "I'm not your daughter. Not legally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck Celeste like a slap in the face, and she stumbled backward, gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's anger flared. "Aurora, that's enough. You're just making things worse. Why say these stupid jokes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's voice was calm, but it carried the weight of finality. "Stupid jokes? I'm not your family. Don't you know? Legally speaking, I have no ties to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible!" Barnett spat, his face reddening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to know if it's true?" Aurora said coldly. "Ask your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett whipped his gaze to Celeste. "Mom, is it true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had been found eight years ago and had been with them for three years after getting out of prison, but her legal status had never been settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assumed Celeste would give him a firm answer, but instead, she faltered, her eyes shifting nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's heart clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So legally speaking..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste buried her face in her hands, sobbing uncontrollably. "Aurora... I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora scoffed, "Sorry? Why? The servants at Elvador Villa call Bertha 'Ms. Elvador', but they call me just 'Aurora'. It's fine, really. After all, my parents never intended to acknowledge me. I'm just a guest in that house, not a part of the family. Now, can you all leave?"</span></p></div>
