        <h1>Chapter 33 What Can You Really Do</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face was filled with anticipation as she said, "Aurora, you can ask for anything. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to earn your forgiveness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said it with great Her words were earnest, and her eyes were resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone would believe her, but Aurora didn't trust a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" she asked, her expression neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste nodded vigorously. "Aurora, please believe me. I won't disappoint you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at her, a flicker of mockery flashing through her eyes. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste couldn't help but smile, but it froze on her face as she heard Aurora's next words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can kick Bertha out of the house and cut ties with her, I'll forgive you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's grip tightened on her dress. She was caught between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pleading gaze met Aurora's unwavering, cold stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into an oppressive silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Celeste finally spoke, her voice dry, "Aurora, Bertha... she's been with us for so many years. Your father and I have always treated her like our own daughter. If we suddenly drive her away and cut ties, people will talk. And she hasn't really done anything wrong. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sneered, "If she hasn't done anything wrong, then why did you delete that surveillance footage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was speechless, unable to find a single word to defend herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Elvador, stop making excuses for yourself. You never cared about what others thought of the Elvador family. After all, at that party five years ago, the police took me away right in front of all the high-society guests. You never cared about the family's reputation. At the end of the day, you're just biased. Admit it. Bertha is your precious gem, and I'm nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's heart ached. She clutched her chest, her eyes brimming with sorrow. "Aurora, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Celeste's heartbroken expression, Aurora only felt her hypocrisy. She spoke softly, "Forget it if you can't do it. I knew this would be the outcome. I never expected you to actually do anything for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Celeste's face as she shook her head frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice inside her told her that if she didn't appease Aurora this time, their relationship would be over for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a step forward and clutched Aurora's hand, her voice trembling and urgent. "Aurora, don't say that. Give me one more chance. If you can let Bertha stay, I'll do anything you ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste grew even more desperate. "Aurora, I know you've been wronged, but I do love you. I just... I'm not very good at expressing myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha had the largest and best room in the Elvador Villa. She received a monthly allowance of a million dollars. Her birthday dresses started at a million dollars. Every piece of clothing she wore was custom-made. Even a casual cup of coffee cost thousands of dollars...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's love for Bertha was so evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when it came to her, Celeste claimed to be inept at showing affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Essentially, Celeste simply never valued her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste neither cherished her nor was willing to let her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Aurora, it no longer mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If five years in prison hadn't made her see the truth, she would be really foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at Celeste for a long moment, her gaze pressing down on her like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste looked away, daring not to meet her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she spoke slowly, "Alright, I'll give you one more chance. Bertha can stay at the Elvador Villa. If you can climb the nine hundred and ninety-nine steps to the Lotus Temple and ask Gabriel to pray for me, I'll forgive you. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face turned pale. Her lips trembled, her eyes filled with fear and hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine hundred and ninety-nine steps to the Lotus Temple were steep and treacherous. Even young people struggled to climb them, and she was already fifty. Despite her regular exercise, she couldn't compare to the physical endurance of someone younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she attempted the climb, her legs would surely give out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the wife of the Elvador Group's chairman, she couldn't afford to be seen in a disheveled state. If someone captured her and posted it online, she would be ridiculed in the high-society circles in Orley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Gabriel at the Lotus Temple didn't meet just anyone. He only prayed for those he chose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Gabriel refused to see her, all her efforts would be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing the pros and cons, Celeste said with difficulty, "Aurora, can you ask for something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't help but laugh scornfully. "Mrs. Elvador, you want my forgiveness but keep bargaining with me. Do you think you're at a market?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's face flushed. She lowered her head, overwhelmed with guilt. "Aurora, it's not that I don't want to. I'm just too old to climb mountains."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes were filled with disappointment and indifference. Celeste clearly wasn't willing to pay the price but couldn't bring herself to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing is ever enough. What can you really do? Do you even want to make amends, or are you just here to mock me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was devastated by Aurora's questioning. She choked out, "No, Aurora. Please believe me. Give me one last chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora just looked at her coldly, her gaze piercing through her heart. "I've already given you a chance, but you didn't value it. Your so-called motherly love is just empty words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not like that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste shook her head frantically, on the verge of breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, one last time, really. Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she opened them again, Celeste was taken aback by the determination in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mrs. Elvador. Since you're so insistent, I'll trust you one more time, but this is the absolute last chance. If you fail again, we'll have no relationship from then on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste felt a sense of relief and nodded eagerly, though the panic in her eyes betrayed her inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched Aurora intently, her body tense. "Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora met her gaze. "The Elvador family has raised Bertha for twenty-three years and spent more than a hundred million on her, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was taken aback. "Aurora, are you asking for money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't beat around the bush. "What I really want is beyond your reach. You can only offer me money. I don't need a hundred million. Just ten million. If you can do that, we'll consider the past settled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten million dollars wasn't a small amount for Celeste, but it wasn't unmanageable either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would need some time to arrange it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the previous two demands, this one was the easiest for her to fulfill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing that Aurora might change her mind, Celeste quickly agreed. "Alright, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had nothing more to say. "You can go now. I'm tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'm leaving, I'm leaving..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Celeste's retreating figure, Aurora curled her lips into a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, her goal had been very clear&mdash;she just wanted the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew that if she had asked for ten million dollars upfront, Celeste would never have agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't even give her a monthly allowance of half a million dollars. Aurora never expected Celeste to agree to ten million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she had to make two demands that Celeste found outrageous and impossible to fulfill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, when she finally asked for money, Celeste would agree without hesitation.</span></p></div>
