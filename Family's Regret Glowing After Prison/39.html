        <h1>Chapter 39 What She Used to Be</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's gaze briefly flickered over his bleeding hand, but her expression didn't even twitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her indifference instantly pulled Adolph back five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the last competition of her high school career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On that day, he was running a fever of 103&deg;F, but still insisted on participating just to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she found out he was burning up, her eyes reddened with worry, and she scolded him, "Are you crazy? You're burning up and still going to a competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing her so concerned, his heart warmed, thinking it was all worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was even angrier. "You're on the verge of losing your mind, and you're still smiling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora had never missed a competition, except that one.</span><span> </span><span>She skipped it to take care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frail girl had nearly carried him to the nearest clinic, dragging him along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay on the hospital bed getting an IV, and she stayed right by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, they were inseparable. Now, they were strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same girl who'd cried over his fever was now standing there, cold and unaffected by his bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had she really become that indifferent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy quickly brought the first-aid kit to bandage his hand, and Bertha, on the verge of tears, gently choked out, "Adolph, how could you be so careless? Hold on, it'll be done in a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph seemed oblivious, his eyes fixed firmly on Aurora, unable to tear them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at her expressionless face, an indescribable emotion welled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora sat with her hands folded neatly in her lap, like a cold statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The softness that once tugged at her heart when he was sick had long since turned to dust during the five years of her imprisonment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that remained was fear toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the wound was dressed, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett glared at Aurora. "Are you in such a hurry to leave this family? Or do you think that by marrying into the Hawke family, you'll live a life of luxury, like some rich wife? Aurora, how materialistic can you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Again. </span><span>Without any regard, he'd always assume the worst of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't matter. She didn't care how he saw her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't deny it. "Yes, I do want to marry into the Hawke family and live like a rich wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was calm, as if she were speaking about something perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's face twisted, and for a moment, he didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, trying to compose himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heir of the Hawke family had a bad reputation, and with Aurora's current health, marrying him would only hasten her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might not even survive the wedding, let alone enjoy it. I won't approve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked, a mocking smile spreading across her face. "Your parents agree, and so do I. What makes you think you have any say in it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I'm your brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never acknowledged you as one," she shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's anger flared at Aurora's cold indifference. He took a step forward, his finger nearly poking her in the nose. "Aurora, don't think that marrying into the Hawke family is some fairy tale. Do you know what kind of person their heir is? He's notorious, a playboy who's had woman after woman. What kind of life do you think you'll have with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tilted her head slightly to avoid his aggressive finger. Her gaze was unwavering, her voice a cool challenge. "So what? It's still better than being treated like an eyesore in this family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was chilling, each word echoing through the large living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua frowned, slamming his cup onto the table, making a loud "clink" as he did. "Barnett, enough! This matter has already been decided. You have no say in it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste quickly stood and grabbed Barnett's arm, her voice soft as she tried to calm him down. "Barnett, don't make this worse. Aurora marrying into the Hawke family is her good fortune, and it benefits all of us. We'll gain something from it too." She glanced at Barnett, signaling him to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shook off Celeste's hand, his chest heaving with anger. His eyes drilled into Aurora, like he was trying to see through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora didn't even acknowledge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Barnett stormed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joshua and Celeste exchanged a look before they left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, knowing what had just happened, sighed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents were likely going to try to talk Barnett down, so she'd better go check on things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adolph, stay here for a bit. I'm going upstairs to see what's going on," she said, heading for the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living room was left with only Aurora and Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora didn't want to be alone with him. She'd witnessed his terrifying side during her time in prison, and facing him alone now made her feel like she couldn't breathe, like all the painful memories would come rushing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jumped to her feet, but in her haste, her calf hit the coffee table painfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't care. She just wanted to get away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly walked out of the room, not heading to Barnett's bedroom, but toward the utility room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was about to close the door behind her, a strong hand shoved it open and slammed it shut, pinning her against the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so close that she could smell his cologne mixed with tobacco.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could see her terrified reflection in his sharp, cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her panic and resistance were apparent, but all Adolph could see was her trembling, fragile body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger and frustration flared, but feeling her delicate form beneath his grip, his fury had nowhere to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just stood there, staring at the vulnerable woman in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled under his touch, her delicate hands pushing against his chest with all her strength, trying to keep him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This defiance stirred a strange mixture of pity and desire in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he remembered how resolute she'd been in agreeing to marry into the Hawke family earlier, jealousy surged inside him like a wildfire, threatening to consume him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes bore into Aurora, his gaze almost devouring her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, his voice dripping with bitterness, "So eager to get married, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each word felt like it was forced through clenched teeth, filled with resentment and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora pushed at him again, but he was like a wall she couldn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was furious and desperate, her face flushed with emotion. "None of your business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's eyes darkened. He gritted his teeth. "None of my business? Aurora, don't think I don't know what you're up to. What's this? You ruined Camille and now you think you can just walk away? Have you even considered whether I approve of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Aurora marrying someone else ignited his jealousy like an uncontrollable blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aurora, don't be stupid. The Hawke family is not a place for someone like you, and their heir is not someone you can approach." Adolph's voice softened slightly, but the urgency in his eyes only grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was terrified of him, but at that moment, she just looked at him quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, she spoke, "Not someone I can approach? Can I approach you?"</span></p></div>
