        <h1>Chapter 211 Aurora's Epilogue V</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked at Julian&mdash;flustered, adorable, completely thrown off&mdash;and felt a soft flutter in her chest. Still on one knee, she looked up at him, eyes full of hope, like a beam of light shining straight into Julian's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, it was like time stopped. Joe and Oliver, who had been loudly begging Aurora to play house with them just moments ago, now stood frozen, mouths agape, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian snapped out of his daze and met Aurora's unwavering gaze. His heart gave a strange thump. "I... I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes lit up instantly, sparkling with joy and a sense of fulfillment that could only come from something deep and true. She beamed. That smile came straight from the heart, brighter than any she'd ever smiled before&mdash;past or present. It outshone even the midday sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stretched out her small, chubby hand. Julian, face flushed red, reached out and gently took hers, helping her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At five years old, Aurora barely reached the chest of ten-year-old Julian. She had to tilt her head all the way back just to look at him. From this odd little upward angle, he still looked flawless, handsome and picture-perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Juli, starting today, I'm your fianc&eacute;e," Aurora said in her soft, syrupy voice. Sweet and warmed, her words melted right into the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's cheeks burned even redder, like he might spontaneously combust. Since his mother passed away, no one had ever been this close to him. Not even his father, who never stopped calling him weird and cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aurora&mdash;this tiny girl he'd just met&mdash;wasn't afraid of him. She actually liked him. She wanted to marry him. And the crazy thing was he didn't mind. In fact, when she'd proposed, something in his usually quiet heart stirred for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe... just maybe, if she becomes my bride, I won't have to be alone anymore? Maybe she'll stay with me forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stared at her, lost in her clear and innocent gaze. Before he even realized it, he was reaching up to take off the pendant around his neck. His fingers carefully touched the trinket. It was a tiny silver ring, threaded on a thin string.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, he slipped it over Aurora's head. The ring slid down the string and rested against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes widened the moment she saw it. She knew this ring. In her last life, Julian had worn it on his pinky like a promise ring. Later, he'd placed it on her finger himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beatrice once told her this ring was Julian's mother's keepsake. It meant the world to him. He never took it off. And now, here he was giving it to her again. It was like she was the only one he'd ever choose. This time was eighteen years earlier than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora felt a surge of warmth flood her chest, wave after wave of emotion crashing over her until she was completely overwhelmed. She reached up and gently clutched the ring at her chest. "For me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded, his little face serious, like this was the most important thing he'd ever done. "I've always kept it with me. Now I want you to have it." His voice was soft but firm. "When I'm older, I'll put it on your finger myself." As soon as he finished, his whole body practically steamed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stood off to the side, watching Aurora cozy up to Julian, and felt like his entire worldview had just shattered. He was panicking, furious, and on the verge of collapse.</span><br><span>What is happening here? Is this real life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always assumed Joe and Oliver&mdash;with their big personalities and smooth talk&mdash;would be the main threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They know how to charm and how to win someone over with just a few words. But somehow, the usually silent and stone-faced Julian has only just met Aurora and is already taking her away? Absolutely not. This "engagement"? Over my dead body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "My sister doesn't want your stuff. Aurora, give it back. If you want something, I will buy it for you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even finish, Aurora cut him off. She blinked her big, innocent eyes and said, "But I like this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's heart sank even further. "I'm your brother. Are you really going to leave me for Julian, that cold-faced guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian ignored the look of envy and frustration on William's face. He gently held Aurora's hand and said, "Let's go to my house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's eyes lit up instantly. She had been curious about Julian's house for a long time. She hadn't had the chance to visit in her past life, but now, she finally had the opportunity, and there was no way she would let it slip by. She might even get to see Beatrice and Ashley, whom she missed terribly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Aurora answered eagerly. "Let's go right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe grinned, saying, "This is unexpected. A girl actually likes Julian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver responded casually, "What's so strange about it? Doesn't that girl from the Carter family like him too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joe raised an eyebrow. "You mean Megan? Julian's always annoyed by her. She's nothing compared to Aurora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver chuckled, "If Megan sees how gentle Julian is with Aurora, she might just lose it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William clenched his teeth. "If she even thinks about messing with Aurora, I'll make sure she regrets it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora followed Julian to the Hawke Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand mansion before her looked like a palace, standing tall behind a vast lawn. The villa was designed in a unique style, with ivory-colored marble walls that gleamed softly in the sunlight. The walls were decorated with intricate carvings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora was in awe, taking in every detail. She couldn't help but marvel.</span><br><span>The Hawke family is as rich as the Barron family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her excitement was barely contained, and she followed Julian into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped inside, Aurora scanned the rooms, eager to see Beatrice and Ashley. But to her surprise, those familiar and comforting faces weren't there. The large house was quiet, with a few uniformed servants working calmly and efficiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Aurora asked, "Juli, where's your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's voice was as calm as ever. He replied, "Grandma is at Hawke Estate, and my dad's at the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart sank a little.</span><br><span>Madam Hawke isn't here after all. I guess I won't get to see her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian noticed her change in mood and gently squeezed her hand. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing," Aurora quickly regained her composure and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll show you my room." Julian led her upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they entered his room, Aurora's eyes widened in surprise. The room was immaculately clean, with no clutter in sight. Its layout was simple and elegant, looking more like a grown man's room than a child's. But it suited Julian's personality perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gestured for Aurora to sit on the bed, then just stared at her, his eyes fixed on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora tilted her head, unable to stop looking at him. As they stared at each other, she slowly inched closer to Julian, her eyes sparkling with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian froze, his body tensing as he stammered, "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Aurora pressed a soft kiss to his cheek, her voice sweet and soft. "I like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's mind went into overdrive, the words "I like you" echoing in his head. His face turned bright red, from his cheeks all the way to his ears, his eyes nervously darting around, unsure where to look. His small hands instinctively gripped the bedspread, his heart racing out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurora likes me at first sight? It has to be, or she wouldn't have proposed to me earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora watched Julian, her laughter bubbling up as she saw how flustered he was. She found him incredibly cute, a world away from the composed and reserved Julian she had known in her past life. Laughing, she reached out and gently poked his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poke sent Julian into a deeper state of embarrassment, and he didn't know how to react. Suddenly, he jumped up from the bed, startling Aurora with his sudden movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked in confusion, looking at him curiously. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face turned even redder as he muttered, "I... I'll go get you a drink." Without waiting for Aurora's response, he hurried out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora couldn't help but chuckle as she watched Julian rush off.</span><br><span>Is he this shy when he is younger? I just kissed him and teased him a little. Why is he reacting so flustered? I've expected him to remain as composed as he was in my past life, with his usual calm, detached demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smiled to herself, crossing her arms, a fond look crossing her face.</span><br><span>The young Julian is so adorable. It looks like I am playing the long game here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got up and stepped out of the room, standing at the railing on the second floor, watching Julian's figure move around in the kitchen below. Julian stood at the kitchen counter, his back stiff and his hands busy with something she couldn't quite make out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door to one of the bedrooms opened, and a woman with a graceful figure and an alluring appearance stepped out. She wore a low-cut slip dress, the hem swaying with her movement, revealing her long legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she spotted Aurora standing by the railing, her brow furrowed.</span><br><span>When did a kid show up in this house? I've never seen her before. Is this the child Julian brought home? What a surprise. Julian, who has always been so cold and distant, actually brought back a little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman narrowed her eyes and stepped closer to Aurora, her footfalls soft, almost imperceptible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Aurora's rebirth, her hearing had become unusually sharp, and she immediately noticed the footsteps. She quickly turned around and saw the woman standing right beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's pupils dilated as she recognized the woman. Although they had only met once in her previous life, she vividly remembered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was none other than Julian's stepmother&mdash;Judy. In her past life, Judy had caused a scene at Beatrice's birthday party, accusing Aurora of being a mistress trying to seduce Julian's father, and had slapped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Julian, furious and seeking revenge, had destroyed Judy's face, knocking out all her teeth and leaving her hand crippled. As for what happened to Judy after that, Aurora had never found out. But one thing was certain: Julian never let anyone get away with crossing him, and Judy had paid the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, looking at her, Judy appeared to be in her late twenties, with an alluring presence and a beauty that could rival any actress. It was her striking appearance that had caught the attention of Julian's father and led to their affair. After his wife's death, he quickly brought Judy into their home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy had been living here for five years now, but she still hated Julian with a passion. However, she didn't dare to provoke him, knowing full well how ruthless and twisted he could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She usually stayed hidden in her room when Julian was home, but she had ventured out this time because she knew he had left. She hadn't expected to find Aurora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's expression hardened, her eyes turning cold as she watched Judy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, noticing Aurora's wary look, couldn't help but inwardly curse.</span><br><span>Typical&mdash;Julian's friends are just as unpleasant as he is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing her disgust, she reached out with her red-painted nails, attempting to stroke Aurora's head in a sickly sweet voice. "Oh my, where did this adorable little thing come from? Are you Juli's friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora instinctively took a step back, dodging her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy's eyes darkened, and her expression grew menacing.</span><br><span>The little brat is really asking for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy sized Aurora up carefully, and then her gaze landed on the pendant around Aurora's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait a minute. Isn't that the same pendant Julian always wears? It can't be. That is his pendant. Julian is obsessed with it, never letting anyone touch it. Now, here it is, hanging around the neck of this little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sly grin spread across Judy's face.</span><br><span>It looks like Julian is quite fond of this girl, if he is willing to give her something so precious. If something were to happen to her&mdash;if she gets hurt or worse&mdash;Julian would be devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unable to take down Julian himself, maybe I can hurt the people he cares about. That'll make him suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Judy had thought, she grabbed Aurora by the arm, yanked her up, and moved towards the railing. She intended to throw Aurora off, hoping the fall would be fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After all, the house doesn't have security cameras, and even if someone investigates, I can easily claim that the little girl fell by accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora, ever so sharp, immediately understood Judy's malicious intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy, as she had been in the past, is just as cruel and vicious. In my previous life, when we had first met, Judy hadn't hesitated to strike me without reason. And now, in this life, despite it being our first encounter, Judy is already trying to harm me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora quickly reached out, gripping Judy's clothing tightly, and screamed, "Juli, help!" Her voice echoed through the vast mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, who was busy making juice for Aurora in the kitchen, heard the scream. His heart skipped a beat, and in one swift motion, he rushed out of the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking up, he saw Judy attempting to throw Aurora from the second floor. His expression immediately darkened. "You dare touch her?" Julian's voice, heavy with barely contained anger, rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy froze, her legs turning to jelly at the sight of Julian. "Julian? You're here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. It's not what it looks like," Judy stammered. "I was just playing with her. Please, don't misunderstand." Panicked, she quickly released Aurora and looked up at Julian, her eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, holding a knife used for cutting fruit, fixed his gaze on her. His silence made him seem like a predator about to strike. But then, without warning, Julian smiled, "Aurora, come downstairs for your juice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora let out a breath of relief, turning to throw Judy a mocking look before she dashed down the stairs. Reaching Julian, she grabbed his hand, her steps quick. Together, they walked into the kitchen, but before entering, Julian paused and shot a cold, almost lethal, glance at Judy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judy shivered at the look.</span></p></div>
