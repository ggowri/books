        <h1>Chapter 170 So Exciting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As autumn arrived, the weather grew cooler, and the days grew shorter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the streetlights flickered on, casting a warm glow over Lily as she stood at the entrance of Orley University of Technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced into the distance from time to time, waiting for Aurora and Daisy to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes, a sleek black Maybach slowly pulled up in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the car came to a stop, her heart clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this car all too well. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ethan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, vivid flashes of last night's madness surged into her mind, beyond her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This morning, when she was showering in </span><span>the</span><span> dorm, she noticed the countless marks Ethan had left on her body. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost unbearable to look at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing she could be grateful for was that he hadn't left any visible marks on her neck. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to show her face in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want to face Ethan, so without thinking, she quickly turned and started walking back into the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she took a few steps, a soft, familiar voice called out from behind her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her steps halted instantly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly turning back, she saw the Maybach's window roll down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy sat inside, smiling warmly as they waved at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze inadvertently swept to the driver's seat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan lounged against the seat in a relaxed manner, a faint smirk on his face, his eyes brimming with amusement as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're Daisy's daughter. It's a pleasure to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's heart skipped a beat as she met his teasing gaze. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged within her, and she quickly lowered her eyes, unable to bear looking at that face that threw her entire world into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Aurora and Daisy would take a cab, but to her surprise, they were in Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What is this man up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitant, she had no desire to get into Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan seemed to sense her hesitation and raised an eyebrow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, get in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daisy, oblivious to her unease, urged, "Lily, don't just stand there, get in the car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily gritted her teeth, silently groaning, but she steeled herself and walked towards the Maybach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door, intending to sit in the back seat to keep her distance from Ethan, but she found the back seat already occupied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only were Aurora and Daisy there, but Julian was too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted Julian to move to the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Julian merely cast her a brief glance before closing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had no intention of moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora and Daisy spoke at the same time, "Lily, you can sit in the front."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Lily walked to the front seat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the door opened, she was met by a bouquet of bright red roses sitting on the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petals glistened with dewdrops, vibrant and fresh, </span><span>exuding</span><span> a delicate fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s lips curled slightly as he looked at Lily, a playful gleam in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Walker, I heard your birthday is tomorrow. On my way here, I specially picked up this bouquet as a gift for you. Do you like it?"</span><br><span>"He emphasized 'specially picked up for you' with deliberate weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily met his bold gaze, and a wave of warmth flooded her ears, turning half of her face bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flustered, she clutched the roses to her chest, covering most of her face with them, feeling slightly more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-yes... I like it..." she muttered, sitting in the front seat, her eyes turned toward the window, deliberately ignoring Ethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was silent, the scenery outside quickly retreating.</span><br><span>Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s peripheral vision was fixed on Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s profile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ears were still red, and his smile deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to enjoy her discomfort, but still maintained his gentlemanly demeanor, refraining from further teasing.</span><br><span>His fingers lightly tapped the steering wheel in a rhythmic motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the car was tense and awkward. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily held the roses tightly, trying to shield herself from the overwhelming sense of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when she thought this difficult journey would soon be over, Ethan suddenly extended his right hand and casually placed his arm on the central armrest between the seats. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, his large hand quietly slid onto Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s slender waist, his fingers pressing lightly at her sensitive waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ugh</span><span>..."</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily let out a soft moan from the unexpected touch, her body stiffening instantly.</span><br><span>She turned abruptly, only to see Ethan staring straight ahead, his face serious, as though nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hand continued its mischief, clearly enjoying the thrill of secrecy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's face turned scarlet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to curse him out</span><span> </span><span>but feared Aurora and </span><span>Daisy</span><span> would notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath quickened, her heart pounding in her chest. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she dared not make any sudden moves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lower lip, silently enduring the waves of tingling sensations running through her waist, desperately trying to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite her best efforts, Daisy had already noticed the earlier sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, what's wrong?" Daisy's voice carried a hint of concern. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Lily extremely nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-nothing, I just got pricked by the roses," Lily hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted the bouquet towards Ethan, carefully hiding his hand from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was terrified that the three people in the backseat would notice. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they did, it would be an utter embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes glinted with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the entire ride, Lily felt like time was moving unbearably slowly, each second dragging on like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the car finally pulled up to the restaurant, Lily was drenched in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the car stopped, she practically bolted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, slow down!" Daisy called out, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hurried into the restaurant, explaining, "I... I</span><span>'</span><span>m going to the restroom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed into the restroom, quickly turned on the faucet, and splashed cold water onto her burning face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The redness slowly faded, and she looked at her reflection in the mirror&mdash;her face covered in water and her eyes filled with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cursed herself for not being able to stay composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never been so embarrassed before. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ethan, you'd better not mess with me</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or else...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Lily managed to calm herself down and stepped out of the restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, she bumped straight into Ethan</span><span>'</span><span>s chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Getting this bold now?" Ethan leaned down slightly, whispering near Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s ear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warm breath sent a shiver down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s greatest fear was facing him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed him hard, but his large hand firmly wrapped around her waist, and she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just won't go away, huh?" Lily gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan remained silent, holding Lily close, forcefully leading her into </span><span>the</span><span> restroom stall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cramped space was filled with their combined breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes widened, her chest heaving with tension, and she whispered furiously, "Are you crazy? This is the women</span><span>'</span><span>s restroom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ethan grinned wickedly, not loosening his </span><span>hold</span><span>, but pulling her even closer, as if trying to mold her into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you afraid of? No one</span><span>'</span><span>s here now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke, leaning down, his nose brushing Lily</span><span>'</span><span>s hair, taking a deep breath as if savoring her scent.</span></p></div>
