        <h1>Chapter 217 Epilogue: Aurora XI</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was all too familiar to Auror</span><span>a, </span><span>just like the false accusations she faced in her past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Bertha was framing her for a crime she didn't commit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> this time, it wasn't Joshua standing beside Bertha; it was Barnett.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's heart clenched. She balled her fists tightly, her gaze fixed on Barnett.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In my last life, Barnett fell for Bertha</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s lies and testified against me, landing me in jail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, I want to see what he</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ll do after witnessing Bertha's crime himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett stood frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Bertha had always been sweet, well-behaved, and lovable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected her to push Megan down the stairs and then pin the blame on someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Barnett met Aurora's icy, probing stare, an inexplicable wave of guilt surged through him as if he had somehow wronged her before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But we've only met twice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Barnett was at a loss, Bertha grabbed his arm in panic. "Barnett, help me! I didn't mean to!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How am I supposed to help you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are only three of us here. If you back me up and say Aurora pushed Megan, everyone will believe it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett shuddered, wondering if he had misheard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Bertha as if seeing her for the first time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since when did my sweet little sister become like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of irritation rose in him, but Bertha was still </span><span>his little sister</span><span>, the treasured jewel of the Elvador family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way he'd side with an outsider over her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as he turned to Aurora. "I</span><span> saw you</span><span> pushed her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stairwell fell into dead silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Barnett felt as if all his strength had drained away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett felt drained, unable to meet Aurora's eyes, fearing the hatred he might see.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hatred in Aurora's gaze. No surprise, either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Barnett always favored Bertha and how little she mattered to the Elvadors.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she had already accepted it, there was no disappointment left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A </span><span>mocking smile</span><span> tugged at </span><span>Aurora's lips</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She faced this situation differently now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her previous life, she had sobbed and screamed, desperately pleading, "It wasn't me</span><span>.</span><span> It was Bertha!" But no one had believed her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Aurora didn't struggle</span><span> or</span><span> argue. She knew the Barron family would stand by her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not that unwanted, bullied Aurora anymore</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I have a family</span><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at</span><span> Barnett and Bertha, and suddenly, she laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The</span><span> </span><span>sound echoed sharply in the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are truly rotten and pathetically stupid</span><span>,</span><span>" </span><span>s</span><span>he </span><span>said, pointing up. </span><span>"The security camera caught everything. Did you think you could frame me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their heads snapped up, and their faces paled at the sight of the camera.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora smirked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her past life, Celeste had erased the footage, leaving her defenseless against the Elvadors</span><span>'</span><span> lies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had a loving family and solid proof.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestia Palace was the only seven-star hotel in Putnam, with serious power backing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She doubted the Elvadors had the influence to tamper with their security feeds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This time, I hold all the cards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dripped with scorn. "My parents adore me. What do you think will happen to the Elvador family when they find out you tried to frame me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertha, though panicked, refused to back down. "You're just nouveau riche trash. We aren't afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora's smile turned even colder. "You still don't know my name, do you? I'm a Barron&mdash;one of the four great families of Putnam."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horror flashed across Barnett and Bertha's faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, </span><span>Aurora had no interest in wasting more time on them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to find Mom. She'll worry if she comes back and can't find me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she turned to leave, footsteps echoed from below.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They grew closer, then stopped beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora looked back, </span><span>meeting</span><span> Julian's bright eyes as he took her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flushed slightly. "Julian... Did you hear everything just now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a small nod. "Aurora, letting them off so easily is too merciful. They tried to frame you. They need to be punished."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still holding her hand, he began ascending the steps, one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett and Bertha trembled under Julian's icy, impassive gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at just ten years old, Julian carried an intimidating aura, his eyes sharp with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they reached the top, Julian faced the two and said calmly, "I'm ten years old&mdash;below the age of full criminal responsibility."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett's </span><span>eyes widened</span><span>. "W-What </span><span>do you mean</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sm</span><span>irke</span><span>d, but his eyes remained cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, he seized Barnett and shoved him down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barnett tumbled violently, landing in a crumpled heap beside the unconscious Megan, his body twitching in pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Julian kicked Bertha down after him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pampered girl shrieked the whole way down before crashing at the bottom, blood streaming from her head as she passed out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it was done, Julian spoke coolly. "Neither of them has reached the age of full criminal responsibility either. Since the law can't touch them, I'll avenge my Aurora myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was light, but every word carried a bone-chilling edge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora stared at Julian in awe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't afraid. She didn't find him cruel. She only admired his courage to fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I had been like him in my </span><span style="font-style: italic;">past</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> life, the Elvadors </span><span style="font-style: italic;">wouldn</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> have hurt me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she threw her arms around Julian, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian... Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stiffened, unused to such sudden closeness. He had always been solitary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't resist. He loved it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then,</span><span> </span><span>footsteps </span><span>echoed</span><span> from the stairwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aurora released Julian and looked down, straight into Celeste's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze narrowed. </span><br><span>Celeste's timing is as perfect as it was in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, after Bertha pushed Camille, Aurora and Celeste had arrived at the scene one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Celeste knew Aurora couldn't have pushed Camille from below, she still protected Bertha and deleted the footage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now, seeing her precious son and adopted daughter lying bloodied at the bottom of the stairs... I wonder how she'll react.</span></p></div>
