  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's sudden roar echoed, yet there was no response from the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Wesson's face instantly turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization also involved in this war?" Wesson asked tensely, scanning the area but relaxing when no figures emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, however, wore a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared, "League of Divine Descent, Eityreia Organization, if you don't make your move now, I'll order an immediate withdrawal! I've waited for decades; I don't mind waiting a few more years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you don't ever expect to get Rosmandi's rare metal mining rights from me under the guise of legitimacy again! Our cooperation is canceled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, thunderous, reverberated far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was fixed in a particular direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a figure appeared where he was staring, followed by more and more figures, quickly reaching over a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came from different countries and families. Each possessed powerful auras, with the weakest being Class S. Three among them stood out, their auras comparable to Gerardo's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were top-tier Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hailing from diverse Divine Families worldwide, they claimed to be descendants of gods and had formed an even more massive superpower&mdash;the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the league said, "Gerardo, why so impatient? We're here now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an elderly man with withered hair but an incredibly intimidating presence. He was Armstrong, the former head of the Thornberry family&mdash;the strongest in the league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Armstrong, don't think I don't know what the League of Divine Descent is up to! You want me and the Augustine family to weaken each other, then swoop in to clean up the mess and force me to cede more mining rights, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong shrugged. "Think what you want! Let's just get rid of the Augustine family! Sebastian, that bastard, killed my son Rumen. I'll destroy his entire clan and make him pay dearly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying killing intent erupted from Armstrong, and the hundred Class S powers behind him also exploded with might, their battle spirits soaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo coldly interrupted, "Hmm, not so fast! The Eityreia Organization hasn't shown up yet! I don't want my people fighting hard while others reap the benefits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, looking in another direction, "So, Eityreia Organization, if you don't appear, I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, figures began emerging in that direction&mdash;a hundred of them, led by Sin with a face full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin growled, his eyes turning bloodshot with rage, "We've been here for a while!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just didn't show ourselves because we didn't see Osborne. But if you need help, we don't mind taking out the Augustine family first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still say the same thing. I want Osborne's head! I'll use his head and blood to mourn my late wife and daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Sin waved his hand sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Free hunt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the hundred Eityreia Organization assassins vanished into the void, entering stealth mode and launching surprise attacks and assassinations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a warrior from the Augustine family, hundreds of yards away, felt a sudden slicing sensation as his throat was brutally cut. His piercing scream echoed across the battlefield, accompanied by a spray of blood that arched through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of agonized cries erupted almost simultaneously as one hundred Class S assassins from the Eityreia Organization appeared on the battlefield like specters, moving with deadly speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any poor soul who caught their gaze was as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Armstrong raised his hand. "Let's join the fray!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are the descendants of the gods, their emissaries! I hereby declare that the Augustine family is guilty! Anyone allied with the Augustine family shares their guilt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together, we will purge this wretched world of the guilty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a hundred Class S elites from the League of Divine Descent sprang into action. Light erupted from their bodies, radiant as the sun, their pure energies morphing into lethal weapons. No one could withstand their onslaught&mdash;not even the battle drones hovering high above, which fell like rain, one after another, from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this unfold, Gerardo finally broke into a satisfied grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization adding their two hundred Class S warriors to the mix, he realized he wouldn't even need to play his trump cards. The Augustine family was as good as done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze settled on Wesson, whose face had gone pale as a ghost. "It's all over for you now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Sebastian awakens, you're still toast!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
