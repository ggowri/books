  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power! Space manipulation can be considered a form of elemental force, right?" Osborne murmured to himself as he watched Orion walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the feeling that Orion had to be eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I finally got rid of Apollo and freed Clarissa from that engagement, only to have Orion show up with a level two ancient magic weapon to propose? Not on my watch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tense expressions on Clarissa and Donna's faces told me everything I needed to know&mdash;Orion's chances of winning over the Radcliffe Estate were alarmingly high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I absolutely cannot let Orion get to the Radcliffe Estate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to take him out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it's because Orion wants to marry Clarissa or because he has just tried to kill me, there is no denying it: we are now enemies. As long as Orion is alive, peace is a distant dream for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, why shouldn't I strike first and eliminate Orion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that thought took root, it was impossible to suppress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's sharp voice cut through the tension, her eyes blazing with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Clarissa, you two are being reckless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you be so intimate in front of everyone? Now that your relationship is out in the open, brace yourselves for the storm that's coming. I can't protect you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's impulsive kiss in front of Orion had clearly rubbed her the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, wrapping her arms around Osborne's, her expression resolute. "Aunt Donna, we're not afraid! We've made our choice, and we're ready to face whatever comes our way. If it's going to be exposed, then let everyone know I have a boyfriend. I'm only marrying Osborne; no one else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed, the weight of the situation settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think that will stop them from pursuing you? You're being naive. Do you think Osborne is some highborn heir? Or a noble scion? Or maybe he's the Godfather's grandson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if everyone knows he's your boyfriend, that won't stop others from wanting to marry you. Your public declaration just puts a target on Osborne's back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose, wanting to reveal the truth about being the Godfather's grandson, but the thought of the four competitors from the Augustine family held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That information couldn't be made public yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trouble and danger that would follow would be far worse than what he faced now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, don't worry. I'll take care of this mess! Soon, no one will dare propose to anyone from the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna snorted, crossing her arms. "And how do you plan to do that? You think you can scare everyone off? Come on, are you just blowing smoke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I'm blowing smoke or not, Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you'll see soon enough," Osborne replied confidently, giving Clarissa's arm a reassuring pat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to take care of some things and will be gone for a while. Stay safe here at the manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern flickered across Clarissa's face. "Osborne, what are you planning to do? Please don't be reckless. We promised to face everything together. Don't go off on a dangerous mission alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he nodded to Barlyn and made his way out of the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once in the car, he immediately opened the Draco Star Wristlet's marketplace and navigated to the intelligence page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ordered, "I need all information on Orion, the heir of the Lark family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And his current location!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his request, it wasn't long before he received a prompt response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With anticipation, Osborne clicked to access Orion's dossier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, a 25-year-old heir of the Lark family, was the son of Gabriel, the head of the Lark family. As a Class B space elemental metahuman, he was the only descendant of the Lark family to unlock the spatial power in a century.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned through Orion's dossier, his brow furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class B space elemental metahuman? When I faced him, his strength certainly matched that classification, but something felt off. He's definitely hiding his true strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter if he's Class B or even Class B+, I will take him down today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion, since you dare to set your sights on Clarissa, you're headed straight for hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he murmured these words, a notification pinged on his device, revealing Orion's real-time location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Radcliffe Manor, Orion was leading a sizeable convoy of followers straight toward the Radcliffe Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought grimly, "Looks like he's really going for it&mdash;trying to win over the Wise Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer size of the convoy made it clear that Orion wasn't trying to conceal his movements; the Draco Group's intelligence network had easily picked up on his whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect. I'll use you to send a message to the others!" Osborne whispered to himself, glancing at Orion's route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he revved the engine, setting off in pursuit.</span></p><div class="pagination">
