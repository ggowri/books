  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder who had been speaking with Osborne earlier now coldly said to Lionel, "We don't care who you are, whether you're Lionel or someone else. Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge immediately! That</span><span>'</span><span>s not something you can keep for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We</span><span>'</span><span>ve chased Osborne for so long with so many people. There</span><span>'</span><span>s no way his Kingdom Duel Badge will be yours alone. Hand it over obediently, and we can let you take a bigger share."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, don't even think about leaving today."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is also a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, among the dozen or so people present, there was another warrior of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, while the rest were at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. Osborne, relying on Satan's Eye, noticed that all of them were disguised, with none revealing their true faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, silently memorizing their true appearances, planning to take revenge once he had the strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his gaze turned to Lionel, wanting to see how he would respond.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could Lionel be intimidated by these people? If he really takes out the Kingdom Duel Badge and shares it with them, that would be trouble," Osborne </span><span>said</span><span> to himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his worries were clearly unnecessary. Lionel would never easily hand over something already in his possession. Even when facing two warriors of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection at his level and over a dozen warriors of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, he would never back down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if the more than 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were divided among nearly twenty people, even if he got a larger share, it would only amount to around 500,000. That wouldn't even be enough to buy a single supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To obtain the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he went as far as burning his blood essence to chase Osborne, barely managing to stop him, erase the imprint on the Void Sword to gain trust, and secure his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. There was no way he would just give it up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel sneered and replied, "Ridiculous! The Kingdom Duel Badge is something I obtained on my own. Why should I share it with you? If you want it, come and take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he unleashed his full power instantly, swiftly charging toward Osborne, aiming to reclaim his Void Sword and make a quick escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His idea was good, but hard to achieve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man reacted swiftly, or rather, he had already anticipated Lionel's refusal and prepared in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Lionel move, he immediately took action. "Stay with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from the old man, instantly engulfing Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel, though angry, was unafraid and unleashed a powerful force to resist. Unfortunately, he was alone, while the opponents trying to stop him numbered over a dozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a dozen attacks struck simultaneously, each immensely powerful, leaving Lionel no room for carelessness as he frantically dodged and counterattacked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An intense battle unfolded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne became a bystander in the chaos. Having lost the Kingdom Duel Badge, he was no longer seen as a threat, and no one would bother wasting effort on him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curved slightly, revealing a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The fiercer you fight, the better. This way, no one will notice me, and I can slip away smoothly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he did not leave immediately but kept his eyes fixed on the Void Sword nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel tampered with the Void Sword. It c</span><span>ould</span><span>n't be stored in Dimensional Space or Satan Space, and even touching it with bare hands cause</span><span>d</span><span> injury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I want to take this Void Sword, it seems a bit tricky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt unwilling in his heart. This was a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of controlling the void. Now, with Lionel's mark gone, it had become a masterless sword, floating right in front of him, yet he couldn't take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He secretly made up his mind. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Before leaving, I must find a way to take the Void Sword. A perfectly intact Supreme Sacred Artifact is absolutely not to be missed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps the Warfare Ancient Tree ha</span><span>d</span><span> a solution. </span><span>He</span><span> c</span><span>ould</span><span>n't touch this Void Sword, firstly because Lionel tampered with it, and secondly because </span><span>his</span><span> own strength </span><span>was</span><span> insufficient, </span><span>and his</span><span> cultivation level </span><span>wa</span><span>s too low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Warfare Ancient Tree </span><span>was</span><span> different. Any Sacred Artifact c</span><span>ould</span><span> be hung on it to be nurtured and cultivated, even the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, which </span><span>wa</span><span>s also a Supreme Sacred Artifact. And once a Sacred Artifact </span><span>wa</span><span>s attached to the tree, it c</span><span>ould</span><span> no longer release its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree possesse</span><span>d</span><span> the power to suppress all Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne immediately began trying to communicate with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, although the Warfare Ancient Tree was excellent in many aspects, its intelligence was relatively low, making communication with it far less effortless than with the Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, after some effort, he finally understood the meaning of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It can do it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This discovery thrilled Osborne. He quickly scanned the surroundings, saw Lionel and the others fiercely battling with no one paying attention to him, and decisively ordered the Warfare Ancient Tree to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A jet-black branch swiftly extended from Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a branch of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It twisted and turned like vines or ropes, flexible and agile, instantly appearing before the Void Sword and tightly wrapping around it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Void Sword sensed the anomaly and immediately tried to shake free, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment it was entangled by the Warfare Ancient Tree's branch, the Void Sword's glow suddenly dimmed, ceasing all struggle as if completely subdued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, the Warfare Ancient Tree's branch swiftly retreated into Osborne's body, vanishing silently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, the Warfare Ancient Tree had an additional sword&mdash;the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Void Sword hung quietly on the Warfare Ancient Tree, alongside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, and Bloodwrought Bow, motionless like fruits on the tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the Void Sword on the Warfare Ancient Tree, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It worked. I really hit the jackpot this time. Now it's time to leave!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne, taking advantage of no one noticing, quickly left the battlefield and disappeared from everyone's sight along the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Lionel's battle with the others grew increasingly intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel was gradually falling behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was fighting over a dozen enemies alone. More importantly, his only Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Void Sword, had its imprint erased and was temporarily unusable. He could only rely on two Legendary Sacred Artifacts to fight, making it hard for him to fully unleash his strength. Otherwise, he would never be in such a sorry state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, I must reclaim the Void Sword. With it in hand, these people can't hurt me, and I can escape more easily, leaving them far behind!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Lionel looked toward the direction of the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Void Sword was gone. In the chaos of the battle, he had no idea who had taken his weapon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in his view, that person was definitely not Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with Osborne's strength and cultivation level, it was impossible for him to quietly take the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel felt a surge of anger, but when he remembered Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge in his Dimensional Bag, his emotions gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Void Sword is gone, so be it. At least I got the Kingdom Duel Badge. Since the Void Sword is no longer here, there's no point in staying. Escaping is the priority!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Lionel stopped entangling with others and fled frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those opponents naturally wouldn't let him go and immediately gave chase, with no one paying attention to Osborne's whereabouts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
