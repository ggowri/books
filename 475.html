  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pressed her lips and said with an indifferent tone, "Do you think I'm lying to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his head awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely had his doubts, suspecting that Isa was feeling jealous and deliberately interrupting his intimacy with Clarissa. However, Osborne knew better that Isa would never be so bored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was really jealous, she would definitely not interrupt his intimacy with Clarissa, but would directly kill Clarissa, or kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing figuring it out, Osborne frowned and said, "Isa, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted and didn't answer directly. Instead, she looked towards Clarissa, who had fainted on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said with a hint of jealousy, "She's really beautiful, looking more and more like the Goddess of Fate! Even her figure is exactly the same as the Goddess of Fate's. No wonder you like Clarissa so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt weird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words made it seem as if she had actually seen the legendary Goddess of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention and walked up to Isa, taking hold of her hand and saying, "Isa, are you really jealous? Actually, you're just as beautiful, and your figure is even better. At least, your breasts are bigger than hers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he glanced down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's pretty face flushed, and she gave Osborne a fierce glare, saying disdainfully, "Stop saying nice things to coax me here. Do you think I'm a little girl who can be easily fooled by you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're right. My breasts are indeed bigger than hers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Isa straightened her chest and had a proud look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became restless, the desire ignited by Clarissa not completely subsided yet. Upon seeing Isa's actions, he couldn't help but act on his impulses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, his hand was slapped away by Isa and he didn't touch anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just touched her, so don't touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was disgust in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only say earnestly, "Isa, please tell me quickly. What is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also regained her composure and said calmly, "You can't have sexual relations with her now! At least, you can't sleep with her or do that kind of thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finished saying that, and her pretty face turned red again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised and asked, "Why not? Is there any problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a serious problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said coldly, "She is the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. The fate power in her body is extremely huge, and now it is locked tightly in her body. If you sleep with her now, all fate power will enter your body in an instant like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, there will be only two possible results."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was serious. "Which two results?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said coldly, "The first result is that your body will be able to withstand the impact of fate power, and be tempered and baptized by fate power. From then on, your fate will be forever entangled with hers. Your body will also receive tremendous benefits, even condensing into the Spiritual Being of Fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Spiritual Being of Fate is one of the top Spiritual Beings even in the Age of Gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised and said, "The Age of the Gods? Is there really an Age of the Gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's expression slightly changed, but she just responded coldly, "You don't need to worry about that. It's not the main point. I was just giving an analogy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, if your body can withstand the impact of fate power, it will be tempered and baptized by fate power and gain huge benefits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might even have the potential for rapid advancement, directly surpassing multiple realms, and become the Class S Supreme Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Directly become a Class S Supreme Overlord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked, his eyes filled with excitement and enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "You're getting excited too soon! You only have a chance to become the Class S Supreme Overlord, not to mention that it depends on whether your body can withstand the impact of the fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have to regretfully tell you that with your current physical condition, you can't withstand the impact of the fate power at all! If I hadn't stopped you in time, you might have already died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the fate power rushes into your body, your body will be like an inflated balloon pushed to the limit, and then it will completely burst. Even if the Goddess of Life was here, she couldn't save your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking, and Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that Isa wasn't deceiving him. If he had truly engaged in a relationship with Clarissa just now, he would have indeed exploded as Isa had described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "Isa, how do you know so clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smoothed the messy hair at her temples, as if she was trying to conceal something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said with a calm attitude, "Because I am a top doctor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned but ultimately did not ask any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before saying, "So when will I be able to withstand the fate power from Clarissa? It can't be impossible forever, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Isa said coldly, "Why? Are you so impatient that you want to sleep with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was suddenly embarrassed. "I just want to know the answer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted coldly, "There's no harm in telling you. With your practice of the Breath of Celestial, your body is already strong. After undergoing mutation and integrating with the soul of powers, your body is far stronger than that of a martial master of the same level. So, according to my estimation, when your martial arts realm breaks through to the Class AAA, you will barely be able to withstand the impact of the fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, you can have sex with her again. With the help of the tempering of fate power, you have a very high chance of breaking through the realm directly and becoming a Class S Supreme Overlord!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
