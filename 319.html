  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family still had three operational cruise ships, though they were nearly empty of passengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship Osborne intended to board was the largest among them, named the Alisa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship, a massive vessel built by the Draco Group's shipyard, was 1000 feet long, weighed 180,000 tons, and had seventeen floors, standing nearly 300 feet high. It housed 3,125 standard cabins and 365 VIP cabins, with a maximum capacity of 7,200 passengers and over 1,500 crew members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a behemoth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship's voyage route would pass through six countries over twenty-five days, with nine stops along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheapest ticket was priced at a hundred thousand dollars, while the most expensive VIP tickets exceeded a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During its peak, the Alisa Ship had a boarding rate of over ninety-five percent, bringing the Augustine family more than a billion dollars in revenue from each voyage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After deducting various costs, the profit exceeded six hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a veritable cash cow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family owned six such large cruise ships and twelve smaller ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They once believed that the cruise business would secure their wealth, rivaling any ancient family. However, as accidents began to plague their ships, the business collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the eighteen ships, fifteen were damaged and now docked at the Draco Group's shipyard awaiting repairs. The Augustine family couldn't even afford the repair costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage to those fifteen ships was extensive, and repairing them all would require at least fifty billion dollars in cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's current situation was dire as they couldn't even afford fifty billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't solve their problems soon, they'd have to sell the ships to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If selling the ships didn't work, they'd face inevitable decline and fragmentation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the Mayby City of Skyefall, at the Caldwell Estate, Ophelia directed the bodyguards to load the last piece of luggage into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, are we really going to the Pinchide City of Dampston?" Evelyn asked, her face filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia bit her lip, her expression determined. "Yes! I have to go. If you don't want to, you can go back! Evelyn, I was wrong before. I said many hurtful things to you, and I apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you can understand. I deeply regret divorcing Osborne, but I shouldn't have blamed you. If I had been firm enough, no amount of persuasion would have led me to divorce him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, ultimately, it was my own lack of resolve. This time, I'm going to make amends for my mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've probably heard things about Clarissa and Osborne. They can't be together! Clarissa is about to marry Alexander of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne must be heartbroken right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my chance, my chance to win him back! I don't want to miss it. Besides, our family is at a critical juncture. Luna Jewelry is severely squeezing our business in Skyefall. We need to expand our business into other provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the heir of the Caldwell family, I can't allow the family to decline under my watch. So, whether for Osborne or the Caldwell family, I have to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia finished speaking, and Evelyn sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the point of regretting now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late to try to win Osborne back, even if he couldn't be with Clarissa. Evelyn didn't think Ophelia still had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's and Osborne's positions had reversed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne was an orphan born into the lower class, while Ophelia was a wealthy heiress. Everyone believed that Osborne was unworthy of Ophelia. But now, Osborne had become the heir of the ancient Augustine family in Dampston Province.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Ophelia and Osborne was now larger than it had ever been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Ophelia had hurt Osborne deeply. How could he ever give her another chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's efforts would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Evelyn didn't voice these thoughts. She could sense Ophelia's fragility. Speaking the truth would only make her daughter crumble again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, like a shattered piece of glass barely held together with glue, would break at the slightest touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hope of reconciling with Osborne was the only thing keeping her from falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how slim the chance, Ophelia had to try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go with you. No matter the outcome, we must at least try," Evelyn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evelyn, let's go! We're running out of time. I heard Osborne will board the Alisa Ship tonight. We have to board the Alisa Ship and create a coincidental encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will win you back!" Ophelia said as she got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn sighed again and followed her into the car. The convoy set off towards the Pinchide City of Dampston Province.</span></p><div class="pagination">
