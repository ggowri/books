  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando seemed to forget his precarious situation, his arrogance shining through as he began to make demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh, and soon, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had faced down the Paramount Supreme Clan in the East Zone and stood strong against various factions. Now that they were back on their home turf in the Human Community, why would they fear the Baxter family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Osborne as they did, they realized that even if the Baxter family were a Sanctum Level Power, it wouldn't intimidate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came down to it, they could always retreat and come back stronger later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the laughter continued, mocking Orlando for his delusions of grandeur, thinking he could use the Baxter family to scare Osborne into letting him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Orlando remained oblivious to their amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued with his haughty tone, "You really don't get it, do you? If we didn't have a powerful force backing the Radiant Era Syndicate, we wouldn't dare to take over the Pioneers of Starlight's base! Let me be clear, the Baxter family is the one who ordered us to do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, one of their members is here as a guest! You'd better let me go immediately and apologize, or you're in for a world of hurt when the Baxter family finds out what's happening here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they get angry, even I won't be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne's laughter only grew. "Are you saying that the young man you're with is one of the Baxter family members?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando paused, his brow furrowing in confusion. "How do you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual smile, Osborne's gaze shifted toward the depths of the estate. There, he spotted the other Deity King warriors of the Radiant Era Syndicate, cautiously attending to a young man with an extraordinary presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, that was a member of the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Orlando's protests, Osborne turned to Anastasia and the others. "You all head inside and secure everyone in there! Don't let them escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded eagerly. "Got it, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" she called, and with that, Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, and Bryce charged into the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? That's a member of the Baxter family! If you cross him, you're signing your own death warrant! The Baxter family is a Dukedom Level Power; no one in the West Zone can save you if you offend them, except for the God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed at his words. "Is that so? Too bad for you, I don't care!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Baxter family... Even if they don't come looking for trouble with me, I'll be the one seeking them out eventually! Besides, the Baxter family might soon find themselves in a predicament of their own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing intent flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Hubery's memories, he had learned that both the Baxter family and the Faulkner family had betrayed the Human Community, secretly aligning themselves with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For years, they had been feeding information about the Human Community to the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter and Faulkner families even plotted against the God of Light, hoping to eliminate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sooner or later, Osborne would have to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he lacked direct evidence to prove their betrayal of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne regarded Orlando, a thought struck him, perhaps he could extract some clues&mdash;or even evidence&mdash;from Orlando.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with a calm yet piercing tone, "I think I'm starting to piece things together. A year ago, your Radiant Era Syndicate was on the same mission as the Pioneers of Starlight. But instead of sharing their fate, which was to be besieged by the Dark Deity Legion, you came out unscathed and even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken... You sold out the Pioneers of Starlight, didn't you? Your Syndicate has already pledged allegiance to the Dark Deity Legion! You fed them intel about the Pioneers, leading to their ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why you were able to seize their base without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of 50 thousand Pioneers of Starlight members, 45 thousand perished in that assault! And all of it was orchestrated by your Radiant Era Syndicate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's eyes widened in disbelief. He stared at Osborne as if he had just been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Darren trembled, his eyes turning red with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, is what you're saying true? The reason we were ambushed by the Dark Deity Legion was because of a betrayal from the Radiant Era Syndicate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's voice quivered with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could never forget the horror of that day&mdash;the 50 thousand of them cornered by over a million Dark Deity Legion soldiers with no escape in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fought to the bitter end, refusing to surrender, even as he watched his comrades fall one by one, including the leader of the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had always thought it was just bad luck that they were surrounded, never considering that someone might have betrayed the Human Community and leaked their plans to the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he glared at Orlando, his eyes burned with a fierce determination for vengeance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
