  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice cut through the tension, causing everyone to pause in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia Gellar, the middle-aged woman leading the Gellar family, spoke up firmly, "You can't put him in the dungeon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter raised an eyebrow, clearly taken aback. "Olivia, do you have a different opinion about the punishment we've decided for Lachlan? This is an internal matter for the Swift family, and it shouldn't concern the Gellar family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to his status as a Deity Overlord warrior, Walter maintained his composure, refusing to be intimidated even in the presence of Gellar family members. His tone conveyed a clear message, the Gellar family should stay out of Swift family affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia remained calm as she replied, "While this is indeed your family's issue, it's not entirely unrelated to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just had a conversation with Ms. Hannah Gellar. Initially, she was against marrying Lachlan due to some past actions of his that she found quite off-putting. We were prepared to decline the alliance altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, after hearing Lachlan's words just now, she's reconsidered. She wants to give him a chance, allowing both parties to interact over the next few days before making a final decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I believe that Mr. Walter Swift, it would be best not to confine Lachlan to the dungeon and not to consider replacing him in the marriage to Ms. Hannah Gellar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is because Ms. Hannah Gellar has not shown interest in any other members of the Swift family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a ripple of commotion through the Swift family members, their whispers rising in a cacophony of surprise and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter and Calvin exchanged worried glances, their expressions darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt a twinge of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I had it all figured out&mdash;get locked up in the dungeon, escape, and start fresh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now the Gellar family is throwing a wrench in the works?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Hannah heard everything I just said? She was ready to refuse Lachlan outright, but now she's willing to give him a shot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it! If I had known this would happen, I should have kept my mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, now, the Gellar family has rejected the alliance, and I wouldn't even need to go through with this ridiculous identity swap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, trying to dismiss the frustration. But he wasn't overly concerned; this didn't mean he had to marry Hannah or join the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was simply open to meeting Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things didn't click, the marriage proposal would be off the table, and he wouldn't need to change his identity after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, the identity of Lachlan still held significant value, as the Swift family was the most powerful Human Community faction in Wild Flame City. Abandoning the identity of Lachlan could make it extremely difficult for Osborne to find another suitable cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "For now, I guess I'll hold off on the identity change and just take things as they come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I meet Hannah, I can just do a few things to annoy her, and she'll likely lose interest in marrying me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Walter and Calvin's expressions were growing increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just decided to punish Lachlan, but now the Gellar family was stepping in to halt their plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they backed down now, it would undermine their authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if they went ahead with the punishment, who would be left to marry Hannah?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar family had made it clear that Hannah only had eyes for Lachlan, and this was their only glimmer of hope for the alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if punishing Lachlan upset Hannah?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could ruin any chance of the marriage altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family was in a bind. They desperately needed to forge an alliance with a more powerful faction, and the Gellar family was their best shot. Missing this opportunity could mean they'd be waiting a long time for another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter and Calvin exchanged a knowing glance; their minds made up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter declared, his voice steady, "Since this is the Gellar family's wish, we are more than willing to cooperate! Lachlan's earlier comments may have been a bit extreme, but if you really think about it, there's some truth to them. We, the Swift family, have a lot to be ashamed of!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hereby announce that Lachlan did nothing wrong and will not be punished! For the foreseeable future, Lachlan, your sole task is to spend time with Ms. Hannah Gellar and show her the best version of yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let Ms. Hannah Gellar see just how exceptional the Swift family is! If you need our support, don't hesitate to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Walter finished speaking, the atmosphere in the room shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Swift family glared at Lachlan, their faces a mix of anger and envy. The resentment simmered beneath the surface, and they had no way to express it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about luck!" one of them muttered, fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't shake the feeling that Lachlan's little speech was aimed directly at Ms. Hannah Gellar! He knew she was listening and wanted to win her over by playing the hero," another chimed in, bitterness dripping from his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! And it actually worked!" someone else exclaimed, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's infuriating!" another voice echoed, frustration evident in his tone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
