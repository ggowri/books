  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most powerful strength of Satan's Eye of level four was that it could devour the elemental essences of other elemental metahuman and fuse them into Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Osborne had swallowed a total of six elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were thunder, wind, water, earth, space and fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of them had all been integrated. The integration process was very smooth and the magic light was successfully upgraded to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light of level four was the highest level that had ever appeared in history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But perhaps the previous fusion was too smooth, so Osborne decided to continue to fuse the sixth one and improved the Devil's Light to level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light of level five had never appeared in history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew how powerful it was, and Osborne was also looking forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after starting the fusion, Osborne realized that he was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the fusion started, Osborne's body felt tremendous pressure. The energy dissipated by the fusion of elemental essence increased thousands of times in an instant. In just a moment, Osborne groaned and blood flowed from the corner of his </span><span>mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt his body being crushed by the dissipated energy. His flesh and blood were wailing and every bone was making crackling sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body couldn't bear this huge force and was collapsing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to stop it, but it was too late. The elemental essence was no longer under his control and was completing the final fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't bear it, he would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I will definitely die if I continue like this. The power dissipated when fusing the sixth element is a hundred times that of the fifth. My body is not strong enough to withstand such power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne forced himself to calm down and think about how to solve the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't improve my body's strength, within a minute, my body will explode into countless bloody debris, and I will be dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I improve my body in a short period of time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought of the Breath of Celestial. Ever since he learned the Breath of Celestial, Osborne had practiced it whenever he had time. He could feel the power of it. This mysterious breathing method from </span><span>Glacium</span><span> seemed to be born for him. Every time he practiced it, he could greatly improve his physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one month, his physical fitness was comparable to that of a Class C+ martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a human-shaped beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was far from enough. He had learned the Breath of Celestial only for one month. Even with a Class C+ physical fitness, he couldn't withstand the energy dissipation when fusing the sixth elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To withstand this level of energy dissipation, his physical fitness needed to reach at least Class B or even Class B+ to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was it possible to make rapid progress in physical fitness and reach Class B+ in a short period of time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how magical the Breath of Celestial was, it required gradual practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't rely on the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we can only fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, feeling his body was collapsing at an accelerated rate. He had no time to think but could only quickly mobilize the power of the Blood Cross tattoo on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire, transform!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force burst out from the Blood Cross tattoo and entered Osborne's body. Osborne's body changed rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair grew wildly and turned into long flowing hair, every strand was blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp teeth appeared in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers grew long nails, as sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face became paler and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After transforming into a Vampire, Osborne's physical fitness had obviously been greatly enhanced, and his strength at this time was no less than that of a Class B martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel that the speed at which his body collapsed was slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was still not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming into a Vampire could only allow his physical fitness to reach the Class B martial artist. It was still a long way from Class B+ and he still couldn't withstand the energy of fusing the sixth elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this went on, he would only die a few minutes later at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would still die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that the power in the Blood Cross tattoo was running low and had not been replenished, so the transformation could not be maintained for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should I do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any other way to improve my physical fitness in a short period of time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he thought of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood diamonds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a kind of strange energy in the blood diamonds. Absorbing this strange energy could quickly improve the level of superpowers. Osborne tried to absorb it before, and it easily helped him to become a Class B metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that Osborne felt that after absorbing the blood diamond, his physical fitness also improved slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the improvement was not large, it was still helpful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The unique energy of blood diamonds can definitely help improve physical fitness! But few people would use precious blood diamonds to improve their physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I can only count on the blood diamond!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, quickly opened the Dimensional Space, and took out all six blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne growled and frantically absorbed the power of the blood diamond, but he did not use the blood diamonds to increase the level of his extra energy. Instead, he crushed all the strange energy into his body and into every cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could clearly feel that his physical fitness was improving rapidly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
