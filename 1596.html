  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events left Calvin momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is happening?" he exclaimed, quickly turning to see the culprit behind the ambush&mdash;a woman standing there, her power hovering at the peak of the Transcendent Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was she who had stealthily approached from behind and severed the lower extremities of his man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw that she was merely a centurion, Calvin's anger flared. "What the hell do you think you're doing? Who gave you the right to interfere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman shot him a disdainful glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do whatever I want! None of your business! And how dare you shout at me? Do you want to die? Don't think that just because you're the head of the Swift family, I won't take you down. One call, and I'll ensure the Swift family can't show their faces in Wild Flame City anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her arrogant declaration, laughter erupted around her, leaving Calvin's face flushed with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard such threats before, but those who spoke to him with such audacity were clearly not to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing she was a force he couldn't afford to ignore, he quickly shifted his demeanor, his voice turning almost diplomatic. "May I ask your name, Miss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sylvia Flynn," she replied, lifting her chin slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's mind raced as he ventured, "Wait a minute, are you... the young lady of the Flynn family from the Demonic Dragon Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia pouted, saying, "Now that you know, why don't you skedaddle? I can't believe you had the nerve to let your lackey whip out that ugly thing in front of me! Just seeing it has already polluted my eyes. I'm showing you mercy by not killing him and not dealing with you myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> get lost, or else, even with your ties to the Borden family, I'll make your life a living hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those harsh words, Calvin's face shifted between red and pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was a chiliarch, a rank higher than Sylvia's mere centurion. And he stood at the peak of Celestial Deity, a realm beyond that of Sylvia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here she was, barking orders at him like he was a stray mutt, tearing at his dignity, shredding his pride. How could he not seethe with rage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he remembered who she was&mdash;the lady of the Flynn family, scion of the Demonic Dragon Clan, the mightiest of the Upper Races in Wild Flame City. No matter how much his insides roiled, he dared not let it show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a smile, masking his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my fault for not keeping my men in line. Thank you for showing mercy. I'll leave right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sylvia's anger boiling, he couldn't afford to dwell on Osborne anymore; he wanted nothing more than to vanish and escape her judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, he had been the epitome of servility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he began to help his wounded henchman away, a derisive voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you really do resemble a dog, you know that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When faced with a weaker human, you snarl and bark like the toughest mutt around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when someone from a </span><span>higher race steps</span><span> in, you tuck your tail between your legs and play the submissive pup. You really don't deserve to be a human at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were you, I'd headbutt a wall and save everyone the trouble of watching you disgrace yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hit Calvin like fresh fuel on a fire, halting him in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne, fury burning in his eyes. "What did you say, Osborne? You're looking for a death wish, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, a mocking grin spreading across his face. "Look at you, back to </span><span>baring</span><span> your teeth! Just because I'm part of the Human Community like you, you think you can throw a tantrum? You get all riled up just from a few words from me? And you want to take me out? Ms. Sylvia Flynn just laid into you way worse than I did&mdash;why don't you show her those teeth of yours? She's just a Transcendent Deity, after all. Go on, give it a shot! Prove you've got some manhood left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's eyes glinted with amusement, watching Calvin squirm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted around them, a chorus of mockery that seemed to echo from every corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if a crowd of thousands had gathered just to revel in Calvin's humiliation. Some were there at Osborne's behest, while others were simply enjoying the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Sylvia, she was part of Osborne's plan all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the thousands under Guy's command, she was the only one with ties to the three Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was a lesser member of the Flynn family, she was still a Flynn, and Osborne had anticipated that her status could come in handy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had brought her along to Divine Peak Nine, and now he had subtly directed her to humiliate Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to form, Calvin, intimidated by her lineage, had swallowed the insult in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel contempt for someone like Calvin, who somehow managed to become the head of the Walker family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead meat!" Calvin's fury boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tolerate being humiliated by Sylvia because she belonged to the Demonic Dragon Clan, a family the Swift family could never afford to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fact that Osborne dared to mock him was a bridge too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With rage coursing through him, Calvin stormed towards Osborne, divine power radiating off him like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'm going to end you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
