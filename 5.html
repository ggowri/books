You wanna save her? Then get Ophelia Caldwell</span><span>'</span><span>s ass over here!" Osborne threatened coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e slammed the door shut</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What are you going to do to me?</span><span>"</span><span> Evelyn cried as Osborne released his grip and tossed her to her bedroom floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Stay here,</span><span>"</span><span> Osborne instructed. </span><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be right back.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left the room and began his search, hoping to find at least some of his belongings. As he went from room to room, a warm feeling washed over him. After years of humiliation, he finally felt powerful. He was in control now, and he loved every moment of it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t love, however, was that Evelyn seemed to have told the truth about discarding his belongings. Furious, he stormed back to the bedroom. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne entered the room, he saw Evelyn</span><span> standing naked in front of the massive, floor-to-ceiling window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze at the sight before him, taking in her tight, supple form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her back to him, she lifted her plump butt high, </span><span>giving Osborne the perfect view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't kill me..." </span><span>she</span><span> softly pleaded over her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he had </span><span>one</span><span> hand pressed against the window</span><span> and the other between her legs. Her low moans filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew exactly what this was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was desperately trying to seduce</span><span> him</span><span>, hoping that sex </span><span>would subdue him. Or distract him. Perhaps both. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> shivered lightly, just enough to make her </span><span>ample, perky breasts</span><span> </span><span>quiver</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often forgot h</span><span>is mother-in-law was </span><span>only</span><span> thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five years ago, she married Ophelia's dad, </span><span>who</span><span> died the </span><span>following</span><span> month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span>'</span><span>d stayed single ever since, just to enjoy the Caldwell family</span><span>'</span><span>s wealth. And despite the little show she and Ophelia orchestrated earlier this morning, Osborne had it on good authority that Evelyn also hadn't slept with a man since. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but lick his lips, a wild look flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since </span><span>Ophelia and Evelyn had teamed up to frame him just to force him into a divorce</span><span>, what better way to get revenge than to sleep with his mother-in-law for real?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slowly </span><span>approached</span><span> Evelyn</span><span> and dropped his pants. Evelyn couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but turn to get a look.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>My, my, my,</span><span>"</span><span> she sighed, surprised by his impressive length. </span><span>"</span><span>Who would</span><span>'</span><span>ve guessed?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You always underestimated me,</span><span>"</span><span> Osborne replied with a satisfied smirk. </span><span>"</span><span>Now, turn back around&mdash;and spread your legs.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>O</span><span>h!" Evelyn </span><span>moaned</span><span> as Osborne took her hips in his hands, teas</span><span>ing her with his tip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled with anticipation. She was already wet. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he turned her head, </span><span>meeting</span><span> </span><span>his</span><span> cold sneer with </span><span>eager eyes.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span>... </span><span>You</span><span> feel </span><span>incredible</span><span>" </span><span>s</span><span>he </span><span>whimpered</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> chuckled coldly.</span><span> "Just wait. Soon, </span><span>y</span><span>ou</span><span>'</span><span>ll be begging me to stop.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I need it,</span><span>"</span><span> she groaned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he </span><span>eased himself inside her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn released a feral cry as Osborne slid between her tight folds. She tilted her hips deeper into his lap, hungry for more.  </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Don</span><span>'</span><span>t stop! Harder</span><span>!" she moaned</span><span>, on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne</span><span>!</span><span>"</span><span> a familiar voice roared from the doorway. </span><span>What the hell are you doing? Let my stepmom go!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne refused to stop, even as Ophelia stepped closer. Seeing her furious only made him more determined to pleasure Evelyn. He savored the a</span><span>stonishment </span><span>on</span><span> her face. This was the sweetest revenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped, </span><span>getting a wild idea.</span><span> "Perfect timing, Ophelia! After everything I've done for you these past three years, you </span><span>have the audacity to ask me for a</span><span> divorce? </span><span>You want to leave me with nothing</span><span>? That</span><span>'</span><span>s not how this works. </span><span>Get over here and bend over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged forward, pulling out of Evelyn and </span><span>tugging</span><span> Ophelia </span><span>toward</span><span> him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Put your hands against the window,</span><span>"</span><span> he commanded. </span><span>"</span><span>Stand beside your mother. And drop your panties.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia obeyed, but not quickly enough. </span><span>Osborne spun her around </span><span>and </span><span>hiked </span><span>her</span><span> dress up to her waist, revealing her voluptuous figure</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For three years, every time we </span><span>fucked</span><span>, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">you</span><span> had to be on top, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">you</span><span> had to be the boss</span><span>! This time, I'm riding you! You two will pay for what you did to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began spanking </span><span>them both, each open-palmed blow landing with humiliating force.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear and anticipation gripped </span><span>Ophelia and Evelyn; they had never seen Osborne like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Smack</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, don't stop..." Evelyn </span><span>groaned, throwing her head back in ecstasy</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes </span><span>had</span><span> glazed over</span><span> and her jaw hung slack. S</span><span>he was getting even wetter, practically dripping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moaned and trembled</span><span> until she couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t take it anymore, </span><span>collapsing weakly against the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia blushed deeply at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>L</span><span>eaving Evelyn on the edge of ecstasy, </span><span>Osborne turned his full attention to </span><span>Ophelia</span><span>, </span><span>spanking her with an open palm, making sure she knew who was in control. </span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>er trembling legs clamped tighter together </span><span>with each smack.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t help but step back and admire his work. He </span><span>felt his mouth go dry seeing their plump, juicy asses on full display, begging for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As much as he would</span><span>'</span><span>ve liked to deny them any further pleasure, h</span><span>e couldn't </span><span>help himself</span><span>; his cock twitch</span><span>ed</span><span> with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still think I</span><span>'</span><span>m a loser? I</span><span>'</span><span>ll show you," Osborne promised.</span></p><div class="pagination">
