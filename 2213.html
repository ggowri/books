  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the news, Osborne's eyes lit up with a flicker of hope. The prospect of finding his parents, even as he stood on the brink of breaking through to Ascension Seven, made him suppress his advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he realized it was bad news, his expression shifted to one of tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and asked, "What's going on? Just tell me&mdash;I can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst-case scenario was that his parents had been dead for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter truth Osborne wasn't ready to accept, but he knew he could bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't hesitate, sensing his urgency. "Osborne, if our investigation hasn't gone awry, </span><span>it seems your parents... they might have been sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sold?" Osborne echoed, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They aren't dead; they have been sold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What kind of situation is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Based on your orders, the Empire of the Sun has been frantically searching for them. Various factions are eager to please you and have been putting in a lot of effort, but there's been no trace. It's as if your parents never set foot on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things remained a mystery until recently when the Mystic Feather Clan offered a clue. They suspect that over the past century, the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan have been secretly running a slave-trading operation. They've been snatching up talented warriors from the Human Community on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet and selling them to the dark forces on other planets in exchange for resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They think that right after your parents landed on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, they were probably captured by the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan and then sold off to other worlds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on this lead, we dug deeper and sure enough, found that the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Paramount Supreme Clan are indeed involved in this slave-trading racket. After some... 'encouragement', we managed to track down one of the guys who might have personally captured your parents and sold them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her hand, Isa conjured up a member of the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked </span><span>like</span><span> </span><span>a complete mess, weak as a kitten, clearly having gone through a lot of torture and interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Osborne, the man immediately pleaded, "Your Majesty! Please, have mercy on me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were just following the Paramount Supreme Clan's orders to sell slaves from the Human Community. We had no idea your parents were among those we sold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty, please!" The member of the Demonic Dragon Clan </span><span>sobbed,</span><span> his voice thick with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face clouded over, and he ignored the man's pleas. Instead, he reached out, grabbed the man, and without a moment's hesitation, snapped his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, activating his Satan's Eye, Osborne delved into the Demonic Dragon Clan member's memories and locked them deep in his own mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and quickly scanned through the memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a surge of emotion hit him, and he jolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face brightened with excitement; he had indeed seen his parents in that memory. It was over twenty years ago, shortly after they'd arrived on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet from Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their luck had run out when they bumped into a hunting party from the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way for them to escape, and they were captured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's parents were then locked up in a secret place, surrounded by other talented slaves from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they'd rounded up enough captives, a Supreme Malevolence Airship showed up </span><span>at the prison, all set to take them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to be sold off to other planets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After rummaging through the Demonic Dragon Clan member's memories, Osborne's emotions were in turmoil. Anger and relief were at war inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of his parents being sold into slavery by the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Paramount Supreme Clan made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a glimmer of hope&mdash;they were still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still a shot at rescuing them, as long as he could figure out where they'd been sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he realized the memories he'd accessed didn't give away the destination of the Human Community slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Isa, his voice calm but insistent. "Isa, do we know where my parents were sold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, but there was a hint of hesitation in her manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just spit it out!" Osborne pressed, his patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Isa spoke, "According to our investigation, the Paramount Supreme Clan had two buyers for the Human Community slaves. One is the Phantom Tide Demon Sect from </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, and the other is an intermediary organization&mdash;the Mystic Sirius Sect from the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Tide Demon Sect? Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "The slave trade operations of the Paramount Supreme Clan are a bit chaotic. We've captured many of their people, but no one can definitively say whether your parents were sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect or the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we can be sure it was one of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, that's somewhat manageable. They're the most powerful force on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet, but their leader is only a Supernal Deity King&mdash;not quite at the Empyrean Sacredness level. Even if he's stronger than Lord Malevolence, it's not by much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if your parents were sold to the Mystic Sirius Sect, we'd be in serious trouble! The Mystic Sirius Sect is far more powerful than the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, with plenty of Empyrean Sacredness warriors. They're not something we can handle right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, the Mystic Sirius Sect is just an intermediary. They acquire Human Community slaves from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet not for themselves but to sell to other factions for profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if your parents were sold to the Mystic Sirius Sect, they likely aren't there anymore. They've probably been sold to someone else already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa finished, Osborne's face grew even graver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was becoming increasingly complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he reminded himself that having some information was better than none. No matter where his parents were, he could follow the leads and keep searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just hoped they were alive because as long as they were, there was hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With steely determination, he declared, "Every single person involved in the Human </span><span>Community slave trade from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Demonic Dragon Clan&mdash;kill them all! Leave no one standing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added urgently, "And make sure everyone is ready! Once I break through to Ascension Seven, we'll leave </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet immediately! I originally planned to use the Cosmic Translocator on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet to head to the Racial Convergence Planet, but now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we'll need to stay on </span><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet for a while to investigate the Phantom Tide Demon Sect and find out more about my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, determination flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded in agreement. "Got it! I'll make arrangements right away! We're all set to go at a moment's notice..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling the full weight of the situation bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer held back his cultivation level. Stepping out of Hope Haven, he left </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet and ventured into the boundless starry sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast expanse of the cosmos, his cultivation level soared from Ascension Six to Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had become an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous hum, a gigantic Ascension Stairway materialized before him once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne faced the trial of the Ascension Stairway anew and breezed through it with effortless grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Atticus of the Sacred Tiger Clan didn't show up this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he'd thrown in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off the thought, Osborne quickly made his way back to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet as the Ascension Stairway faded into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was raring to go right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His target was crystal-clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Necoton</span><span> Planet!</span></p><div class="pagination">
