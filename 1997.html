  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's worst fears had come to pass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not a fair one-on-one battle but a chaotic ten-on-ten melee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though hailed as the Human Community's strongest Ascension Four, Leopold was more than a match for the Paramount Supreme Clan's Ascension Four warriors, even superior to some.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could not single-handedly decide the outcome of this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could defeat one Ascension Four warrior from the Paramount Supreme Clan, but when faced with the combined assault of two, he quickly found himself overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his immense talent, he was not invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan's ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings had a clear strategy. They coordinated seamlessly, with eight of them momentarily holding back the nine Ascension Four Radiant Guardians of the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining two launched a swift attack on Leopold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Leopold fought valiantly, his lack of coordination with the Radiant Guardians left him vulnerable, and he could not match the synchronized assault. His defenses cracked, and he suffered wounds from the Paramount Supreme warriors' divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his strength, he could not prevent the gap from widening. Leopold survived thanks to the nine Radiant Guardians' protection, but the battle was lost. The Human Community formation faltered, and the Paramount Supreme Clan exploited that opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leopold, who had begged to fight to secure the Human Community's victory, had become the flaw that led to their defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their best efforts, the God of Light's forces could not hold the line. Six of the nine Radiant Guardians were gravely injured, and the team eventually conceded defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first day of the border competition ended with the Human Community's defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the eight battles fought, the Human Community had won only the one at the Deity Overlord Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every other battle&mdash;Transcendent Deity Level, Celestial Deity Level, Deity King Level, and the four Ascensions of Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;had ended in defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was one victory with seven defeats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This result was a blow to the Human Community's morale. Everyone was left in disbelief, unable to accept such a crushing defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a near-total loss. The Human Community had come so close to being swept in all eight rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they knew there was a disparity between the Human Community and the Unity Clan, they had not expected it to be so vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not a difference in numbers but in strength at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can the Human Community truly fight against the Unity Clan, led by the Paramount Supreme Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deity Legion outnumbers us five to one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in these fair battles, we have been so thoroughly beaten! If a full-scale war erupts, can we win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we cannot. It is impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan and the Unity Clan have the upper hand in numbers and quality. I see no hope for victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not surrender and survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least if we surrender, we will live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There is no chance to win! Surrender, and stop throwing away lives for nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan is stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, countless humans began to feel despair. Some were contemplating whether surrendering to the Paramount Supreme Clan was the only way forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "The gap is too wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion has over five hundred billion soldiers, while the Human Alliance only has one hundred billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community has been no match for the Unity Clan in this fair competition. How long can we hold out in a full-scale war?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many will survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many felt the weight of their defeat, considering whether it was time to end the struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "We have fought for a thousand years&mdash;perhaps it is time to stop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human Alliance's morale had plummeted to an all-time low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light could feel the change in the air. Even the leaders of the various factions around her seemed defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight battles had shattered the confidence they had built up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned deeply but felt powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew what they needed was a victory&mdash;a spark of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted to the Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They agreed to this border competition because they wanted to shatter Human Alliance's confidence and will to fight," she mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by stalling for time could we wait for the return of the God of Night. Once he is back, nothing will matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though, I did not expect...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community would collapse entirely! We almost did not win a single round! If this continues, the Human Community's morale will shattered beyond repair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, many may even choose to surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we do not hold on until the God of Night returns, the Human Community may already be scattered, reduced to the Paramount Supreme Clan's vassals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "The Human Community has been able to hold off the Dark Deity Legion for a thousand years, all thanks to the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am merely his spokesperson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night who has fought against the Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the God of Night absent, I can no longer bear the pressure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish I could join the Gods of Destiny, Death, and Space and enter the cycle of reincarnation... " God of Light murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a flicker of vulnerability flashed in her eyes, but she quickly masked it, her expression hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a massive projection of Icy One appeared in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light! Your people have lost again! The eight battles of the day are over, and the Human Community is one win and eight losses! Hah, it is truly amusing! According to our agreement, the Human Community must retreat four million miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light replied coldly. "You do not need to remind us. We will honor our promises. Do not get too smug. Today is just the first day. From here on, we will win it all back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha!" Icy One laughed uproariously. "God of Light, do you honestly think that is possible? You will only lose even worse from here on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze toward the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up! The Human Community has no hope! The Paramount Supreme Clan is the most powerful and noble race in the world! Becoming their vassals is not shameful; it is an honor! If you do not want to die on the battlefield, surrender now! The Dark Deity Legion welcomes you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, you have seen the gap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you persist in refusing to surrender, you will all die when the war begins!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
