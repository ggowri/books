  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's first time unleashing the full power of Space Collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, his attempts had been hindered by slow activation, making it easy for the target to evade the core impact area, resulting in diminished effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even studied Spatial Prison to use in tandem with Space Collapse, but it still fell short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, everything had changed. With just a thought, Space Collapse erupted, unleashing a ferociously compacted space within a 3280-foot radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intensity was so overwhelming that even Osborne, caught right at the heart of the collapse, wasn't so sure he could find a way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily expand the range of the collapse even further if he wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force of the collapse immediately slammed into the Dark Deity, who had just filled the air with his Ethereal Glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shattered in an instant, leaving the Dark Deity utterly unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body soon followed suit, crumbling under the immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" the Dark Deity shouted in a frenzy, summoning all his strength to break free from the Space Collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was no use. Before he could escape the shrinking horizon, his Level Two Divine Body was completely shattered by the collapsing force, even his Divine Bones disintegrating into a mist of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst his agonizing screams, the Dark Deity met his demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated his ocular energy, sweeping it across the remnants of the Dark Deity's memories, capturing them just like he had with Cain's, sealing them within his mind and forming a valuable memory repository.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing this task, he released a deep breath, the weight on his shoulders lightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good thing this Dark Deity was within my capabilities. I managed to take him out! If I hadn't acted so swiftly, he would've recovered his Superior Deity strength before I knew it. At that point, taking him down wouldn't have been so easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne absorbed the Dark Deity's blood energy, sending it through a long-distance transmission to the members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any blood; it was the essence of a top-tier Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potency of his blood energy surpassed that of 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne couldn't see it, he could imagine the rush of energy spreading through the Blood Demon, enabling many of them to ascend to the pinnacle of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame that as the progenitor of the Blood Clan, I can't absorb blood energy to </span><span>elevate my own power. I can only enhance my descendants. If only I could do the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh slipped past his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dark Deity and all his Dark Exotic Beasts vanquished, the lair was on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the fight hadn't lasted long; otherwise, the lair would surely have crumbled, potentially causing a minor earthquake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the lair, a massive cocoon remained, composed of an indeterminate material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's most powerful punch couldn't even dent it. Even when swallowed by his Abyssal Spiral attack, it remained untouched&mdash;simply astonishing in its durability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to take this back! The Materials Research Institute needs to study it. There's a good chance they could discover a new, incredibly resilient material!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they can't figure it out, we could find a way to cut it down and turn it into an inner defense shell. I bet even a Superior Deity would have a hell of a time breaking through that kind of protection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that plan in mind, Osborne waved his hand, opening a Dimensional Space to snatch up the gigantic cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye to scan the area once more, confirming that there were no remaining Dark Exotic Beasts or any other valuable items. Satisfied, Osborne made his swift exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he emerged at the mouth of the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 48 hundred Blood Demon members, along with Anastasia and Zoe, were anxiously fixated on the fissure's entrance. When they saw Osborne emerge, a collective sigh of relief swept through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Thank goodness you're alright!" Anastasia exclaimed, rushing into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had felt the tremors beneath her feet, knowing that Osborne was locked in battle with the Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her worry had been overwhelming, though she could do nothing to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently tousled her hair. "Don't worry, I'm very much alive. I finished off the Dark Deity, and there are no more Dark Exotic Beasts down there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place can actually become a perfect training ground given the rich energy below that surpasses what's outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned his gaze to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their auras had grown far stronger than before. Osborne had first eliminated over ten thousand Dark Exotic Beasts, then took down the Dark Deity, channeling all that blood energy to benefit the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, over three thousand members had reached the peak of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who hadn't quite reached that pinnacle were not far behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleased with what he saw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone rang. Upon answering, he was greeted by his grandfather </span><span>Sebastian's urgent voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, there's big trouble!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
