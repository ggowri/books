Ascension Three and Four Supernal Deity Kings with insufficient soul power fell into madness without even realizing it. Even many of the Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, influenced by the spores, had their eyes turn hauntingly blue, attacking their own comrades in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, countless Ghostwing Insects continued their relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every moment saw lives being claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, each exploration team scrambled to save themselves. They knew their only hope was to flee the mushroom forest. If they could just get out, they would no longer be vulnerable to the deadly spores or the insects' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their panic, the formation of the exploration teams broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At times like these, not everyone would prioritize their companions' lives. Those still unaffected rushed toward the forest's exit, hoping to escape the nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, most had already succumbed to the influence of the spores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, fewer than half would make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, imposing figure soared back from the front, observing the chaotic scene with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Detoxify!" Uriel murmured, raising his hand in a sweeping motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding light radiated from him, illuminating the entire mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone caught in this dazzling glow felt a sudden clarity wash over them, as if ice-cold water had been poured into their brains. The madness began to fade, and those deranged souls quickly came back to their senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They halted their erratic attacks, fear and confusion etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why am I hurt all over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My head feels like it's splitting..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noise of confusion erupted around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne and his group stood awash in Uriel's brilliant light, experiencing a newfound clarity that shielded them from the spores' insidious effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gratitude and admiration filled the eyes of almost everyone as they looked toward Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with an icy calmness, "Listen up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, hold your breath and seal your pores! These mushroom spores can invade your body through breathing or your skin, plunging your soul into chaos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Detoxifying technique offers only a temporary reprieve; it won't last against the hallucinogenic spores for long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, follow me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to cut our way out of this forest at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having issued his orders, Uriel turned and plunged deeper into the mushroom forest. Ghostwing Insects began to emerge around him, but before they could react, they exploded in a violent burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Strong</span><span> power!" Osborne thought, feeling the weight of urgency settle on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's strength was staggering. If he hadn't returned to cast the Detoxifying Technique, many exploration teams would have perished within these cursed woods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the moment, the crisis had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne eyed Uriel's retreating figure, watching the insects Uriel dispatched burst apart, he was filled with an immense sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he were to engage Uriel now, he would have no chance of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even if Osborne threw everything he had into the battle could he compete with Uriel's might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel's power rivals that of the God of Light, if not surpass it!" Osborne thought, his mind racing with the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" he urged, quickly rallying his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Uriel blazing a trail ahead, the number of Ghostwing Insects they encountered dwindled rapidly. Osborne didn't even bother to engage; instead, he used his divine power to support Avery, Godfrey, and the others, guiding them through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they burst forth from the confines of the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They emerged onto a vast platform, where a massive chasm lay ahead, shrouded in darkness like a gaping maw, seemingly leading down to the depths of the earth. Nothing could be seen beyond the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They halted at the edge of the platform, relief flooding through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought we were goners in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness for Uriel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't for Uriel, we'd all be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those damn mushroom spores were terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those pesky Ghostwing Insects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cacophony of voices broke out as the group, battered and bruised, collapsed onto the ground, relief mingling with fear as they gazed toward Uriel, their expressions filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Uriel paid them no mind. He stood at a distance, intently surveying the chasm, his brow deeply furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his group settled in one corner of the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout their escape, Alfreda had been busy tending to Avery, Godfrey, and Hermione's injuries. As a member of the Nature Elf Clan, her innate healing abilities, though not as potent as those of the Life Elf, were powerful in their own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, their wounds began to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville, Arabela, and Cyrus, who had been knocked unconscious by Osborne, slowly regained consciousness. Confusion clouded their eyes; they had no clue what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to us?" Neville murmured, shaking his still-dizzy head, a frown etched on his face as he felt a sharp pain in his chest, reminiscent of a heavy blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Alfreda's voice echoed in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? We went crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hurt Avery, Godfrey, and Hermione? And in the end, Osborne knocked us out to save us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock washed over the three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to Osborne, disbelief evident on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, while the three of them were far more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them, Arabela, was an Ascension Four, and Neville and Cyrus were both Ascension Five. How could Osborne possibly incapacitate them, even in their state of madness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all found it impossible to believe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true. I have no reason to lie. I don't understand how he did it, but he did save you! And this stays between us; Osborne's strength is our little secret," Alfreda insisted, casting a significant look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne remained unfazed by their astonishment. He focused intently on their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining crowd on the platform numbered around six thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each exploration team had suffered heavy losses. Some were taken down by Ghostwing Insects, but far more had fallen victim to their own allies' madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before entering the mushroom forest, close to ten thousand explorers had set out with over one hundred teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only six thousand remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a third of them had lost their lives in the mushroom forest, never to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always known Umbra Earth was perilous, but experiencing its dangers firsthand highlighted just how treacherous it truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the mushroom forest had only been the first barrier they had to pass!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the first barrier, and one-third of their number was forever lost. And these weren't novice explorers; the weakest among them was an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And until now, they hadn't even caught a glimpse of any treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Osborne exhaled in frustration, gazing toward the ominous chasm in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That, he realized, was the true heart of Umbra Earth!</span></p><div class="pagination">
