  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Why are you in such a hurry? The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon isn't that easy to hatch. If it were easy, the Magma Devourer would have hatched it long ago, and it wouldn't be your turn."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, Primordial seemed to be deep in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His branch-like hand was touching his chin at the moment, looking somewhat comical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne did not disturb him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that if it came to knowledge, he was no match for Primordial. If Primordial couldn't figure out a way to quickly hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, then there was no point in him trying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the transparent coffin, Osborne felt a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding mist was clearly released by the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. This mist was likely meant to protect the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. It was incredibly powerful, so much so that even a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness couldn't break through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as the transparent coffin appeared, the mist automatically opened a gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could it be that this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg doesn't belong to the Magma Devourer, but to the Wingless Angel in the transparent coffin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that his guess was quite reliable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A scene seemed to appear in Osborne's mind. On a certain day long ago, the Magma Devourer found a transparent coffin and an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg within the core of a star.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To claim the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg for itself, the Magma Devourer left the star it had always lived on and came to a small resource planet at the edge of the universe. It killed all the natives on the planet and took it over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the planet's environment, the Magma Devourer wanted to hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. It even planted a large number of Beast Soul Flowers in advance, preparing food for the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon after hatching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after tens of thousands of years, the Magma Devourer still failed to hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, and the warriors from the Racial Convergence Planet discovered this planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wingless Angel in the transparent coffin was the true owner of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt this guess was closer to the truth, but it didn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have an idea," Primordial suddenly said. "I thought of a way to quickly hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. However, it might be a bit risky. If we fail, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg might never hatch again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this is the only way. Otherwise, this </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg won't hatch naturally even after tens of thousands of years, because the conditions here simply aren't suitable for hatching it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne curiously asked, "What&rsquo;s the method?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blood-Sacrificing Magic," Primordial said seriously. "Blood-Sacrificing Magic is an ancient ritual method. Initially, it used blood sacrifices to exchange for power from the cosmos. But later, it evolved into many variations, giving Blood-Sacrificing Magic numerous forms."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I happen to know a variation of Blood-Sacrificing Magic. It should accelerate the growth of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg and make it hatch quickly. However, it will require you to consume a large amount of blood."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will also become a sacrifice for the Blood-Sacrificing Magic. If this method fails, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will completely die and turn into a dead egg."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, thinking, "Normally, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg might not naturally hatch for tens of thousands of years? Only Blood-Sacrificing Magic has a chance to hatch it quickly? But if the hatching fails, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will become a dead egg."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated because the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was too precious. If he could hatch the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, it would become a great ally for him. Therefore, Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne couldn&rsquo;t wait tens of thousands of years for it to hatch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who knows what things will be like in tens of thousands of years? Maybe by then, he&rsquo;ll already be dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, even if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg hatches, what&rsquo;s the point?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and asked, "Primordial, how confident are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "I&rsquo;m about fifty percent confident, at most no more than sixty percent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fifty to sixty percent?" Osborne said seriously, "Then let's begin. It's worth a try. Whether I can hatch it depends on its luck."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Alright, I'll teach you Blood-Sacrificing Magic now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne's mind was filled with some new information.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After quickly grasping the information, Osborne had already mastered Blood-Sacrificing Magic. "So that's how it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After simulating it a few times in his mind, Osborne confirmed he had completely mastered Blood-Sacrificing Magic. He looked at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg and the transparent coffin not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to put this transparent coffin away first to avoid it interfering with my use of Blood-Sacrificing Magic," Osborne thought, then once again stored the transparent coffin into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, the transparent coffin didn't come out on its own again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and got ready to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial said, "You need to be careful. </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragons are incredibly rare. If you miss this one, it will be very hard for us to find another."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Shut up. Of course, I know to be careful. Your words do nothing but add pressure on me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored Primordial because he could feel that Primordial was also nervous and knew that Primordial said that to help ease his pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was entirely because the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was just too precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s a terrifyingly fierce beast that, once fully grown, can easily tear apart a star or even destroy a Stellar Region. If Osborne could successfully hatch it and raise it as a pet, it would be a tremendous help to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in Osborne's upcoming revenge plan, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon could provide him with immense support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was nervous, and Osborne was nervous too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne found himself much calmer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll begin." Osborne took out the Warfare Scythe and slashed at his wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body had already reached the mid Sacredness Level, just a step away from advanced Sacredness Level. His skin was incredibly tough, and even an ordinary Sacred Artifact couldn't easily cut through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Warfare Scythe was sharp enough. A huge gash appeared on Osborne's wrist, and blood instantly spurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the blood didn&rsquo;t fall to the ground; instead, Osborne controlled it like a small stream, directing it all onto the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne lost a significant amount of blood. The 33-feet-tall </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was completely covered in Osborne's blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blood-Sacrificing Magic!" Following the Primordial teachings, Osborne instantly performed the Blood-Sacrificing Magic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the blood on the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg seemed to come alive, writhing continuously before quickly merging into the eggshell, causing the entire shell to emit a blood-red glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne was thrilled because if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg's shell absorbed his blood, it meant the first step of the Blood-Sacrificing Magic had succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second step was to use the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, which had absorbed his blood, as a sacrifice for the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the ritual, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg would grow faster. If it could hatch before the ritual was completed, Osborne could immediately end the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forcibly ending the ritual would cost him something. However, if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg could hatch, everything would be worth it to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg still couldn't hatch after the ritual was completed, Osborne would have no choice but to finish the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, Osborne would gain many benefits, but the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg would end up as a dead egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne nervously stared at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, hoping it would successfully hatch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
