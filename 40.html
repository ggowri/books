  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During the next two days, Osborne diligently worked on improving his skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa&rsquo;s single kick that incapacitated Milo left him greatly shaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne believed that with The Breath of Celestial, he wouldn&rsquo;t need much time to reach Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Simultaneously, Osborne didn&rsquo;t neglect to practice his marksmanship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Satan&rsquo;s Eye, his shooting accuracy was good, but he lacked in other crucial areas like speed, target anticipation, and shooting while on the move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These were vital in intense gunfights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne understood that marksmanship was honed through bullet expenditure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he purchased the Draco Model H mini-handgun, he also bought hundreds of magazines and tens of thousands of bullets solely for marksmanship practice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During the day, he diligently practiced marksmanship, combining it with agility and keen eyesight to simulate real combat scenarios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At night, he focused on perfecting The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As his physical abilities grew stronger and with the aid of Satan&rsquo;s Eye, his marksmanship rapidly improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the consumption of a large number of bullets, his marksmanship became increasingly terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, the day arrived for Osborne to attend the banquet at the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He called Ophelia, requesting her to drive and pick him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As per their agreement, he could bring two people to the banquet, and he had already sold these two spots to Ophelia and Wesley for 40 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite his dislike for them, he had no intention of reneging after accepting the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Keeping promises was his basic principle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Ophelia and Wesley arrived in a grand fashion with a convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia rolled down the car window, coldly stating, &ldquo;Get in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smirked slightly, uninterested in sitting with the two of them. He casually boarded a bodyguard&rsquo;s car and headed towards the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The convoy left the city and arrived at a picturesque location on the outskirts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A tall wall enclosed an entire hill, within which lay the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gaped at the huge luxurious estate, which dwarfed even the Caldwell family&rsquo;s manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were equally awestruck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After disembarking at the gate and undergoing identity confirmation, checks, and body searches to ensure they carried no weapons, the three were allowed into the estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They boarded a shuttle heading towards the mountaintop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I must become friends with Ms. Radcliffe. If I can establish a relationship with her, the Caldwell family will soar and become the top aristocratic family in Mayby City.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, on the shuttle, Ophelia turned sternly towards Osborne. &ldquo;Osborne, I hope you don&rsquo;t cause trouble.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley added, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mess things up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at them, coldly laughing, paying no heed to their comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Frowning, Ophelia noticed Osborne&rsquo;s casual sportswear and remarked, &ldquo;Osborne, you&rsquo;re going to have lunch with Ms. Radcliffe dressed like this? Can&rsquo;t you at least dress formally?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, saying, &ldquo;A commoner is always a commoner, ignorant of etiquette. Such an important event, yet dressed so casually. Be careful not to anger Ms. Radcliffe and get thrown out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unable to hold back any longer, Osborne retorted, &ldquo;Mind your own business. You came here like dogs begging for scraps, yet have the audacity to be arrogant in front of me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You son of a&hellip;&rdquo; Wesley snapped, but the shuttle driver interrupted, silencing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had arrived at the mountaintop, where an elegant pavilion awaited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A waitress-like woman approached the three of them, smiling, &ldquo;Three guests, please follow me, Ms. Radcliffe is already waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, she led them to the elegant pavilion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne once again laid eyes on Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Standing in the pavilion, Clarissa gazed towards Mayby City in the distance. Her profile was cool yet soft, her figure perfect and charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Several black-clad bodyguards loyally stood guard by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For some reason, seeing Clarissa again made Osborne&rsquo;s heart race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, the guests have arrived.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa finally turned around, offering a slight smile towards Osborne and his companions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the first time Osborne heard Clarissa&rsquo;s voice, which sounded as melodious as a nightingale. It was not indifferent but with a sense of distance, gentle yet tinged with pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Please, have a seat.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa gestured for the three of them to sit down. Without much thought, Osborne casually pulled out a chair and took a seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley, however, seemed incredibly nervous at this moment, slightly bowing towards Clarissa with a demeanor as if they wouldn&rsquo;t dare sit until Clarissa did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley even hurried over to pull out a chair for Clarissa, but unfortunately, her bodyguards intercepted him, not allowing him to get close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley felt somewhat embarrassed at this turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, Clarissa said, &ldquo;You are all my guests, I want to thank you for your generosity at the charity auction. Please, make yourselves comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a smile, Clarissa took her seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sat right next to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face visibly darkened at this sight.</p><div class="pagination">
