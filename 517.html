  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was proud but not pedantic. Noticing that Julia may not be a match for Osborne, she immediately called on the others to attack him together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "I've told you not to waste time, but you didn't heed my warning. Regardless of whether you come at me one by one or all together, I'll defeat you all the same. So why even bother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn and the others were immediately furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are quite arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Even in Newport City, there are not many people as arrogant as you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All seven of them took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The downpour, controlled by Julia, became even more violent at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain became even more frightening, falling crackling and rippling on the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While manipulating Osborne's shadow to alter his physique, Charlie transformed into a giant and punched him wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn activated Satan's Eye, employing her mind control to assault Osborne and projecting illusions into his mind. At the same time, she unleashed Devil's Light at level two against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other four immediately deployed all their abilities and exerted their utmost effort to bring down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura shook violently at that moment, as if it was about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sparked a glimmer of hope in the seven people, driving them to intensify their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fighting with Class AA masters like Chris and Bruce, he couldn't muster much interest in opponents like Evelynn, Julia, and Charlie, who were not even at Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he managed to kill Chris and Bruce largely due to his luck to neutralize their abilities. In terms of absolute strength, he hadn't reached Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he definitely wasn't someone a few Class A individuals could easily handle together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he finally made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really disappoint me. I thought you could put some pressure on me, but are these all your abilities? How dare you seek revenge on me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you snatch the divine artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are simply asking for your own death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne delivered a punch directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Charlie flew out, spitting blood, and crashed heavily to the ground, creating a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne in shock, feeling that all his bones were about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. He's much stronger than before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie didn't expect that his power to control shadows had no effect on Osborne. He couldn't even block Osborne's casual punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How formidable he was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Newport City, there were not many such individuals among the younger generation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie reminded others loudly, but unfortunately, it was of no use at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against an overwhelming strength disparity, all methods appeared powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Julia was thrown away by Osborne's punch. The residual force of the attack also affected the person beside her, making him spit blood and fly backward, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bangs rang out as the remaining three individuals were defeated one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne knocked down all six of Evelynn's helpers with his pure strength, shattering their defenses and smashing them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't restrained his power, they would have been beaten into a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only Evelynn still stood in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was astonished to realize that her mind control and Illusion Projection couldn't impede him at all and that Devil's Light at level two couldn't shake his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she was extremely desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his eyes on her with a grin and asked, "Do you know why I left you alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn bit her lip. "You're afraid! You know I'm a direct descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City. You realize that harming me would bring you serious trouble. No matter how strong you are, it would spell your doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you didn't attack me. Instead, you're trying to negotiate and persuade me to forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Evelynn with a peculiar expression, as if she were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so naive. How did you survive until now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Actually, you need to be taught a lesson more than anyone else, and you're the one I want to teach the most. So, naturally, I had to leave you alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed and instantly appeared in front of Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She panicked, eager to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne immediately seized her by the collar, pulled her back, and lifted her petite body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was extremely ashamed and angry. "Let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare to harm me, neither I nor my brother will let you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "At this juncture, you still dare to threaten me with Owen? Even if he comes, I will beat him up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and slapped Evelynn in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to be taught a lesson, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still want the divine artifacts, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped her once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You intend to take revenge on me, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's pretty face swelled instantly, and she grew dizzy and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, if you don't come out, I will die!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a menacing aura abruptly enveloped the entire Augustine Estate. Osborne felt an overwhelming force bearing down on him, making it nearly impossible for him to lift his arm as he attempted to strike Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
