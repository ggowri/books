  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed </span><span>deeply,</span><span> frustration etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pantheon League is utterly useless! I've already taken out five Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel Clan, and they still can't hold their own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do they really need me to eliminate two Superior Deities for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he contemplated the unfolding disaster, Osborne realized he couldn't sit by and watch the Pantheon League get wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel Clan triumphed, their first order of business would undoubtedly be to come after the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the power of the Deschanel Clan was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having only thirty-six deities, they boasted a staggering six Superior Deities, whose sheer might </span><span>tipped</span><span> the scales in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At any given moment, each of those Superior Deities was fending off multiple Intermediate Deities from the Pantheon League, along with several Junior Deities, and they were emerging victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bodies of defeated Pantheon League Junior Deities piled up around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, the nearly two hundred Junior and Intermediate Deities of the Pantheon League would be decimated without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't let this one-sided slaughter carry on!" Osborne's expression grew grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to take a risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the performance of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities, he assessed his own abilities. Engaging them directly was a tall order; given his current strength, it would be difficult to gain an advantage, let alone kill one outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there might still be a chance through stealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since each Superior Deity was occupied, battling several Intermediate and Junior Deities at once&mdash;a perfect opportunity for him to strike and take one out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, getting a guaranteed kill is unlikely," Osborne mused, weighing his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he detested the idea of the League of Divine Descent meeting its end, he </span><span>wouldn't mind seeing a few more of their warriors bite the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited patiently for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities have robust defenses. Right now, I can take down an Intermediate Deity in a flash with a sneak attack, but taking out a Superior Deity? That won't be easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I'm still just a Junior Deity! My best bet is to severely wound one and then book it&mdash;no second chances, or I could be in a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious injury would be enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can land a solid hit, the Pantheon League needs to handle the rest. After all I've done for them, if they can't finish off a Superior Deity themselves, then they deserve to be eradicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne picked his target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked onto a particularly imposing Superior Deity from the Deschanel Clan, who was ruthlessly dispatching six of the Pantheon League's Intermediate Deities and fifteen Junior Deities around him, leaving a trail of corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This deity's powerful attacks were fearsome, but Osborne noticed a weakness in their defenses&mdash;this one was the least protected among the six he had observed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to make my move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Deschanel Clan Superior Deity unleashed a fierce attack that swiftly took down a Pantheon League Junior Deity, Osborne seized his chance. He appeared suddenly behind the deity, a divine artifact dagger gleaming in hand, and struck with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of metal slicing through the air rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this Superior Deity of the Deschanel Clan had the weakest defenses among all the Superior Deities present, when Osborne's attack struck his barrier, Osborne still felt a formidable impediment that prevented him from driving his full force through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Superior Deity was formidable, and while Osborne managed to penetrate their defenses, he could feel a massive drain of energy. The dagger pierced the Superior Deity's body deeply, but it fell just short of finding the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But rather than feeling despair, Osborne seized the moment. With unwavering determination, he triggered the dark power coursing through the blade lodged in the Deschanel Clan Superior Deity's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion erupted from within the Superior Deity, a cataclysmic force that tore through his Divine Body, creating a gaping wound that sent a wave of destruction through his vital organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cry of anguish echoed through the battlefield. Despite the debilitating attack, the Superior Deity's vitality surged, fierce and unyielding, but anger flashed in his eyes. He spun around, unleashing a desperate counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, having delivered his strike, bolted from the scene without a moment's hesitation, vanishing as quickly as he appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Pantheon League seized the opportunity. Previously suppressed, they lunged at the wounded Superior Deity like a pack of wolves on a wounded prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of blood sparked their fury, and now that their adversary was reeling from a serious injury, they couldn't resist the urge to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The luckless Superior Deity, weakened and staggering, struggled to fend them off, but the onslaught was relentless. His body began to suffer multiple wounds under the coordinated assault; each cut was a testament to his rapidly deteriorating condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me!" he bellowed, desperation leaking into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, other deities from the Deschanel Clan exchanged alarmed glances, their expressions shifting from shock to horror as they surged toward their beleaguered comrade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was another Superior Deity, ready to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't about to let that happen.</span></p><div class="pagination">
