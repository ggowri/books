  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Chief Judge Rupert's signal, everyone took off like a shot, quickly crossing the rift and landing in the depths below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarcely anyone hung around on the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, snagging a token there was only worth one lousy point. It was peanuts. Everyone there was part of Zephyr State's top dogs, and each one of them could handle the first three layers of the Arctic Maw Chasm. Naturally, they were itching to go deeper and would only call it quits when they hit their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a token on the third layer was worth a cool hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fourth layer? A staggering thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a token on the fourth layer was like striking gold compared to finding a thousand tokens on the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a dumbbell would stick around on the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, almost everyone had made it to the third layer. That was when different paths started to diverge. The majority decided to camp out on the third layer and scattered like cockroaches to hunt for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, around three to four hundred folks decided to take the plunge and go even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only about two hundred people could move around freely on the fourth layer. But a good number of them could manage to stay for a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Clara, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the state duel had just kicked off, Clara still had plenty of Sacred Power in the tank. Naturally, she was eager to start scouring the fourth layer. Once her Sacred Power was running on empty, she'd head back to the third layer to look for tokens while replenishing her energy at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she'd keep this cycle going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the first three days of the state duel, all the participants were forbidden from getting into fights or causing a ruckus. All they had to do was rack up as many tokens as they could and score as many points as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly four hundred people made their way into the fourth layer. Most of them split up like a pack of wild animals, each going their own way to hunt for tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned to Osborne and said, "Osborne, watch your back on the fifth layer! If you start to feel like you can't hack it, hightail it back to the fourth layer right away! Once you're here, give me a shout, and I'll hand over the tokens I've found for you to register!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Roger that! You stay safe too. Don't go getting yourself kicked out of the duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm outta here! Keep me in the loop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Clara took off in a hurry. The fourth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was a real maze. Even with hundreds of folks out there looking for tokens, it was like finding a needle in a haystack to bump into someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any time. He zapped himself to the fifth layer, using the Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were far fewer people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only around a hundred could move about freely on the fifth layer. Counting those who could last an hour or two, there were no more than two hundred in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, most of them had scattered like cockroaches when the lights came on, getting ready to hunt for tokens on the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's team was among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave decided not to head for the sixth layer. Given their team's strength, scouring the fifth layer for tokens was the smartest play. Most of them could stick it out for a good while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the sixth layer, it was a death trap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gustave couldn't hold his own for long on the sixth layer. If he didn't hightail it out of there in time, he'd be history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, break a leg!" Gustave tossed that comment at Osborne before taking off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You too, buddy!" Osborne flashed a smile and bid farewell to Gustave and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of joining the crowd to hunt for tokens, he had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were set on the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't in a rush to head down. He was playing the waiting game, letting Agatha, Horace, and the rest go first. Once he was certain the coast was clear, he'd fire up his Translocator and make his way to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd noticed earlier that fewer than fifty people had ventured to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of those, only around twenty had the chops to stay and operate for any real length of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were just taking a shot in the dark, bound to hightail it back to the fifth layer in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sure, the sixth layer's a real bear, all harsh and dangerous. But a single token there is worth a cool 100 thousand points! That's like finding ten tokens on the fifth layer, a hundred on the fourth, or a thousand on the third...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I can snag one token on the sixth layer, it'll be a game-changer! 100 thousand points could easily land me a solid spot in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne took a quick peek at the badge on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The digits on his badge had undergone a change. His score remained a big fat zero since he hadn't even started his token-hunting mission, so no points to his name just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his ranking had shifted to 256th.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little piece of information told him that at least two hundred folks had already managed to find tokens and rack up some points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a gander at the overall leaderboard and was left gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting pretty at the top was Horace, with a whopping 200 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In second place were two guys tied&mdash;Broderick and Benson, both with 100 thousand points each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming in fourth was Conrad, with 60 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state duel had barely kicked off, and Horace already had 200 thousand points. That could only mean he'd already bagged two tokens from the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick and Benson were also in the thick of it on the sixth layer and had each found a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad, though, hadn't dipped his toes into the sixth-layer action. He was sticking it out on the fifth layer with his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd already managed to find six tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not half bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stole a glance at the leaderboard, feeling a twitch of restlessness in his gut. He fished out a Sacred Crystal, fired up the Translocator, and poof, he was on the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Sacred Power burst forth, enveloping him in a defensive shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying storms raging all around him lashed out at his Sacred Power defense like a pack of wild animals. Osborne could feel his Sacred Power draining away at an alarming rate. If he didn't top it up, it'd probably be gone in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most folks needed the help of Sacred Artifacts just to move around freely on the sixth layer. Even Agatha, Horace, and Broderick couldn't rely solely on their Sacred Power for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? He could keep going like the Energizer Bunny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that his Sacred Power was stronger than those guys. Nah, the real deal was that Osborne didn't give two hoots about the Sacred Power consumption. He had the Chaotic Spiritual Root, firmly planted in the void, constantly pumping fresh Sacred Power into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless the storms here could blow his Sacred Power defense to smithereens in one fell swoop, he was good to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his head for a moment, then whipped out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he bumped into someone on the sixth layer and they caught wind that he could stand up to the storms using just his Sacred Power, they might start making guesses about his real strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't go around showing off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Osborne had Satan's Eye, which could sniff out other folks from miles away. He could easily dodge any run-ins if he wanted to. But the Arctic Maw Chasm was no walk in the park. It wasn't just those bone-chilling storms; there were also all sorts of unknown nasties lurking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Bloodwrought Bow in his grip, Osborne felt a whole lot more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye already in action, Osborne just picked a direction at random and set off on his token-hunting mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, finding those tokens was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had Satan's Eye at his disposal. With its super vision and X-ray vision, Osborne could scope out a huge area. No matter how well those tokens were hidden, they didn't stand a chance of slipping past his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before Osborne stumbled upon a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tokens on the sixth layer were these special crystals, usually a deep shade of blue. Each one had a unique symbol etched on it, along with the number "100000".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant a whopping 100 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed the token against his chest badge, and in the blink of an eye, the number showing his score shot up to 100 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ranking on the leaderboard also did a complete 180. Osborne went from being at the bottom of the pack to landing a spot in the top ten right away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
