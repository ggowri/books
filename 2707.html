  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? There's a problem with Alfreda's fusion with the Elven Mother Tree?" Osborne asked in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he arrived at Elf City, Alfreda had already been killed by Naomi, and he hadn't seen her fusion process. Hearing Isa's anxious words, he immediately stopped his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, restrain her first!" Osborne said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne put away the Domain Suppression Stele and used the energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal the severely injured Isa and Clarissa. Then, he waved his hand to create a light screen, enveloping the three of them within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne began resurrecting Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked worried. If Alfreda had died under normal circumstances, he could easily resurrect her without any abnormalities or aftereffects. However, the issue with Alfreda's fusion with the Elven Mother Tree before her death made Osborne somewhat concerned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Resurrect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, harnessing Alfreda's life essence to reconstruct her body and bring her back from death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Alfreda's body gradually take shape, Osborne felt slightly relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His resurrection ability activated successfully!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least this time, Alfreda could be resurrected, avoiding the previous situation where resurrection was impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching Alfreda's body become more solid, Osborne grew increasingly relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation Isa worried about didn't seem to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alfreda's body was fully restored. Osborne quickly dressed her and quietly waited for her to regain consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after waiting for a long time, Alfreda still didn&rsquo;t open her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, an incredibly violent force suddenly emerged within Alfreda's body, rapidly growing stronger and then turning chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body shook violently, and she suddenly opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne did not feel happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he saw Alfreda's skin fading rapidly, like a withering flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know why this was happening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly channeled the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replenish Alfreda's vital essence, trying to heal her anomaly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his efforts were completely useless!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's vital essence was rapidly dissipating, growing dim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the energy within her became more violent and chaotic, instantly causing blood to trickle from Alfreda's mouth, while her face turned extremely pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Isa, and Clarissa were stunned, staring at Alfreda in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine, it's the Elven Mother Tree that's in trouble!" Alfreda said with difficulty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held her hand tightly and said anxiously, "What exactly happened? Alfreda, what should I do? What's wrong with the Elven Mother Tree? If that's the case, don't merge with the Elven Mother Tree! Even without merging, I can definitely help you quickly improve your cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda shook her head and said, "It's too late! My fusion with the Elven Mother Tree is already complete! The problem occurred when I was using my body's power to repair the essence of the Elven Mother Tree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Elven Mother Tree not only didn't recover but its true essence was harmed instead! The power of the Elven Mother Tree went out of control, and I couldn't suppress it, which led to what just happened."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now it's impossible to give up the fusion! If the Elven Mother Tree dies, I will die too! And it's the kind of death where there's no coming back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's eyes looked a bit dim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want to die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just been resurrected. She hated the darkness after death; she wanted to live. She wanted to stay by Osborne's side, to be with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now she seemed unable to stop death from happening!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The essence of the Elven Mother Tree had an issue, even Osborne's resurrection ability couldn't fix it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne could only resurrect Alfreda, not the Elven Mother Tree!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should we do then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne was a bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly thought of something and immediately awakened Primordial, summoning him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, think of a way quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Primordial was an offshoot of the World Tree, the oldest and most powerful Primordial Creature of the Plant Clan in the Chaotic World. Although the Elven Mother Tree was an Acquired Creature, it also belonged to the Plant Clan, so he thought Primordial might have a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did it end up like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned deeply at this moment but didn't waste time and quickly searched through his memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His memory came from other offshoots of the World Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Primordial was just born, he had stolen part of the memories of eight other World Tree offshoots. Some of these offshoots were already incredibly powerful, even standing at the pinnacle of this cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Primordial knew a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at Primordial with great anticipation. If even Primordial couldn't think of a way to save Alfreda, then Alfreda would truly be in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Primordial opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got a way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne anxiously said, "Quick, tell me, what's the way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa, Clarissa, and Alfreda all looked at Primordial with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial hesitated, seemingly torn about whether to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just say it already!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne grew anxious. Seeing the worried look on Primordial's face, his heart sank, and a bad feeling arose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial finally spoke, "Alfreda has completely merged with the Elven Mother Tree. Forcibly separating them is impossible! Now that the Elven Mother Tree has an issue, it's affecting Alfreda as well. If the problem with the Elven Mother Tree isn't resolved, even if you revive Alfreda a hundred times, she won't recover!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded; he already knew that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then what can be done to restore the Elven Mother Tree?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "In my memory, there's something that can definitely solve the Elven Mother Tree's problem! It can also greatly enhance the Elven Mother Tree's power, making Alfreda's strength skyrocket as well!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is it?" Osborne asked urgently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Plant Clan's most precious treasure&mdash;Fountain of Life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fountain of Life?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! As long as we find the Fountain of Life and use it to nourish Alfreda's body, the Elven Mother Tree can fully recover, no matter how severely its essence was damaged, and it will continue to evolve!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's heart trembled; he had indeed been expecting a "but."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and asked, "But what? Just say it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial took a deep breath and said, "The Fountain of Life is extremely rare and precious! It's been a long time since anyone has heard of its existence. The Fountain of Life is a treasure on the same level as Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Most importantly, at the edge of the universe, the Fountain of Life simply cannot exist! In the outer regions of the universe, the Divine Principle is incomplete, and there are no conditions for the Fountain of Life to form. To find the Fountain of Life, you can only venture deeper into the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the very least, you need to reach the mid-regions of the universe to have a sliver of hope!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Then I'll go deeper into the universe to help Alfreda find the Fountain of Life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head and said, "It's too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda won't make it until then! The Elven Mother Tree will soon die from the essence fading away, and Alfreda will die along with it..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
