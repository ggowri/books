  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was looking at Osborne in amazement at this moment, including Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brad was stunned. He said sternly, "What did you say to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said that you should stay," Osborne said coldly, "The Augustine family is not a place for you to show off. After showing off in the Augustine family, you still want to leave like this? How dare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the atmosphere fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was so angry that he laughed. He pointed at his nose and said, "Why do we do this? Because we represent the Paltrow family! Because our Paltrow family is much stronger than the Augustine family! Because I am a Class A martial master! Is this enough? I want to leave now. Do you dare to stop us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Brad turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I told you, don't even think about leaving safely like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne suddenly took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected that Osborne would actually dare to take action. Osborne's target was not Brad but Yohan and Lauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched Yohan hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's expression changed drastically. He had just been beaten up by Osborne a few </span><span>days ago. Both rows of his teeth were knocked out. He knew Osborne's strength and knew that he was no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan could only shout, "Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad reacted quickly. He was outrageous. "You bastard, how dare you do this? Go away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad also threw a punch and tried to stop Osborne from attacking Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his fist collided with Osborne's fist and made a loud noise. But what shocked Brad was that he did not knock Osborne away and did not even shake off Osborne's fist attacking Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist continued to hit Yohan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Osborne punched Yohan in the face and knocked him backward. The two rows of dentures that Yohan had just been installed flew out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan's body fell to the ground, and he fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad looked at all this in disbelief. An intense anger and murderous intent instantly appeared on his face. "I will kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Brad punched Osborne again. This time, he built up his strength. It was far superior to his previous hasty attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was not panicked. He was even slightly excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never fought with a Class A martial master before, so he took this opportunity to see how strong a real Class A martial master was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that even if he were not a match for Brad now, he would not be beaten badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne threw another punch and collided with Brad. He felt a tremendous force coming with a spiral force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "It's Spiral Force. It's an advanced martial arts power generation technique."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed, but he remained calm. Although Brad used the advanced martial arts technique, his Spiral Force was far inferior to Isa's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been ravaged by Isa's Spiral Force countless times. Brad's Spiral Force meant nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power in Osborne's body also changed slightly in an instant. He instantly offset Brad's Spiral Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Brad's strength was still terrifying, Osborne's current physical fitness was definitely not worse than Brad's. Osborne was even more potent than Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne retook the punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only him but everyone present was looking at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered, "Osborne is actually fighting with Brad, a Class A martial master. Moreover, Osborne doesn't seem to suffer any loss at all. Osborne already has the strength to fight against a Class A martial master. How is this possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's eyes lit up, and he was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac thought about it and waved his hand. Suddenly, a boiling sea of fire appeared </span><span>between Osborne and Brad and blocked Brad's next attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brad, stop it," Isaac said coldly, "This is the Augustine Estate. You attacked the heir of the Augustine family. Do you really think I dare not kill you? Although I am old, it is not a problem for me to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isaac finished speaking, Brad's face turned red. "Isaac, Osborne is the first to attack me. Are you blind? He injured Yohan in front of me. Didn't you see it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac said calmly, "So what? They were having a competition between the younger generation. Who can you blame if you are not as skilled as others? You are a strong man of the older generation, but you are interfering in the competition between the younger generation. Why don't you let me stop you? You should go now before I change my mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad clenched his fists. His face turned red, and the veins on his body bulged. But in the end, he didn't take any action. Because Brad knew that he was indeed no match for Isaac, and if a fight really broke out, Isaac could kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I will remember what happened today. The Paltrow family will remember it too. Isaac, Osborne, just wait for my revenge." After saying that, Brad asked Lauren to support the unconscious Yohan and walked out angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne did not stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, a cold light flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Brad must die."</span></p><div class="pagination">
