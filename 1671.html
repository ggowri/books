  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly held Diana up, preventing her from collapsing, but her face remained pale, a hint of terror lurking deep in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't remember who he is! But I just saw some</span><span> pictures </span><span>flash in my </span><span>brain</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> was pretty surprised. </span><span>"What did you see?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw stairs! Straight, ascending stairs, with countless powerful figures scrambling to reach the top</span><span>! </span><span>But at the end of the stairs, there sat a figure, cross-legged! I couldn't see his face</span><span> clearly</span><span>, but he blocked the way, and then he opened his eyes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana screamed again. Her body trembled violently, and her complexion grew even more ashen. </span><span>Unexpectedly, at this moment, b</span><span>lood began to flow from her Divine Body, pooling around her like a stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she were under some invisible attack. Her Divine Body </span><span>cracked</span><span>, and her soul fragmented...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked. Seeing Diana's condition, he was struck with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop thinking</span><span> about it</span><span>! Don't focus on it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted</span><span> </span><span>worriedly, but Diana's eyes had already lost their focus. She </span><span>was not aware of the</span><span> rapid deterioration of her Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He opened his eyes...</span><span> He opened his eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana murmured, and blood gushed wildly from her mouth. Osborne could feel her life force slipping away, fading fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was totally out of his expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "What is happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of attack is Diana experiencing? Who is behind this? What methods are being used against her? Why is she in such a state?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced, but there was no time</span><span>. It was urgent now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't </span><span>take action</span><span> soon, Diana would die right before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through him. Gritting his teeth, he struck her neck with a swift blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana let out a muffled sound and fell unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she did, her injuries stopped worsening, but the damage was already severe, and her life force continued to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't good! If this keeps up, Diana will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne turned his attention to the white Miracle Elixir growing on the humanoid stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he couldn't carefully extract the Miracle Elixir with its roots intact</span><span>. But </span><span>if he didn't take the roots, he would lose half its potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been torn about what to do, but now he had no choice. Diana was </span><span>dying</span><span>, and the only way to save her was to use the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With urgency, he yanked the Miracle Elixir from the stone. The roots remained embedded in the humanoid figure, but he didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly plucked a leaf from the Miracle Elixir and </span><span>put it into</span><span> Diana's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it touched her tongue, the leaf dissolved, releasing a surge of pure, potent energy that coursed into her body. Diana's crumbling Divine Body and disintegrating soul began to mend, visibly revitalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After feeding her three more leaves, her injuries finally healed completely. Color returned to her cheeks, and her breathing steadied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Diana opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly covered her mouth, shaking his head urgently. "Diana. Don't think about it anymore! You almost died! Clear your mind, and don't dwell on anything</span><span>! J</span><span>ust breathe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the anxious and worried tone in Osborne's voice, Diana nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she was beginning to remember what had just happened. Slowly, she pulled herself together, calming down bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, seeing that Diana</span><span>'s state</span><span> was stable, Osborne finally removed his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you feel?" he asked with concern etching on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana looked at him gratefully. "Osborne, you saved me again. I don't even know what happened. I just wanted to see clearly... but never mind. I shouldn't dwell on it. Whatever it was, it must have been something incredibly terrifying. Just </span><span>thinking of him</span><span> caused me tremendous harm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of horror flashed in her eyes as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared her shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What kind of dreadful </span><span>creature </span><span>could inflict such mysterious attacks with just a thought?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana </span><span>is </span><span>at the late stage of Deity Overlord realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span>'s</span><span> a remarkable </span><span>genius</span><span> </span><span>who could even fight a peak-stage </span><span>Deity Overlord. Yet, even thinking about that </span><span>creature</span><span> almost </span><span>killed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of bizarre power </span><span>is that</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's downright terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel so much better now. But it's a pity... I wasted </span><span>one</span><span> Miracle Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's guilt was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Osborne handed her the remaining half of the Miracle Elixir. "This white Miracle Elixir was meant for you from the start. It just saved your life and even boosted your potential. How can you call that a waste? Take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded and accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her response, Osborne moved decisively. He swiftly harvested the two remaining Miracle Elixirs</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
