  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced down at the elf named Alfreda, who looked remarkably youthful, almost like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, her presence was anything but childlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, which hinted at her considerable age and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her overly enthusiastic greeting made Osborne feel a bit awkward, as if he were on the receiving end of an exuberant welcome that was perhaps a bit too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled him even more was the sight of the Elf Tree, dotted with numerous vacant treehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It raised a red flag in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something off about this place? Could it be a scam?" he thought, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the surroundings for any lurking threats. Once he confirmed that no one was lying in wait, he let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to the elf, he decided it was best to get to the bottom of why the place felt so deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was indeed something amiss, he would be in a heap of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat, Osborne asked, "So, are you the owner here? It seems... a bit desolate. Why isn't anyone renting these treehouses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Alfreda's expression dimmed. "That's because I belong to the Nature Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, puzzled, "The Nature Elf Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with that. This is my first time in Elf City, and I don't know much about it. If you can't explain it clearly, I'm afraid I can't rent from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face fell further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, she said, "Well, since there are no guests right now, I might as well tell you. I wouldn't want you to think I'm trying to pull a fast one on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned and walked into one of the treehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on in! I'll pour you a cup of Elf Water. Don't worry, I won't harm you! We Nature Elves never strike first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but decided to follow her inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interior of the treehouse was simple yet charming, with furniture carved from the very trunks of the Elf Trees. It wasn't extravagant, but it had a rustic elegance that made him feel as if he were nestled in the heart of a forest, bringing an undeniable sense of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda waved her hand, and a stump appeared before Osborne. "Take a seat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then grabbed a wooden cup, and with another wave, a branch descended, dripping a crystal-clear liquid that exuded a delicate fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cup quickly filled, and she brought it over to him, settling onto a stump across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She propped her hand beneath her chin, her gaze tinged with wistfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said, "Drink up! Since it's your first time in Elf City, you've probably never tasted Elf Water. This is the nectar of the Elf Trees! If business were better, you might not even get a chance to try it! Go on, give it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held the cup, pausing before taking a sip. In his mind, he quickly reached out to Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, this Elf Water isn't poisoned, is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! It's a delicacy! This Nature Elf isn't deceiving you. This is a rare treasure from the Elf Trees. Just this one cup is worth at least ten Celestial Crystals!" Primordial replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, thinking, "What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Celestial Crystals for a single cup of Elf Water?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is the same amount I'll need to rent the cheapest treehouse for an entire year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alfreda, his expression a mix of surprise and curiosity. But he held his tongue, lifting the cup to his lips and taking a cautious sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne took a sip, an exquisite fragrance exploded in Osborne's mouth, making him feel as if every pore in his body opened up in pure delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a slight enhancement in his physical strength&mdash;just a tiny bit, but enough to leave him astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering his body had already reached the level of an Infinite Sacred Body, any improvement, no matter how small, was nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he felt ten Celestial Crystals was a steal for this cup of Elf Water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he downed the rest of the Elf Water in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda asked eagerly, "How does it taste? How do you feel? Elf Water purifies the body, flushing out impurities and boosting physical strength. It's quite effective!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, her brow furrowing, "Hmm? You don't seem to be reacting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Usually, the first time someone drinks Elf Water, the effects are most pronounced. They end up releasing a lot of impurities! But you... nothing at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my Elf Water no longer effective?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is your Divine Body so powerful that you simply don't have any impurities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked at him with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. His body had surpassed the limits of a Level Ten Divine Body, reaching the Infinite Sacred Body stage, which meant he was already pure and free of impurities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf Water, while potent, wasn't enough to change that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to steer the conversation in a different direction. "Thanks for the Elf Water, Alfreda! It was delicious! My name's Osborne Augustine. Now, could you tell me why there aren't any other guests around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied her, sensing that Alfreda was far friendlier than any of the other elves he'd encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being around her put him at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sighed again at his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I don't have any guests is because I'm part of the Nature Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the second time he had heard her mention her clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does being part of the Nature Elf Clan have to do with the lack of guests?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could ask, Alfreda continued, "Since this is your first visit to Elf City, you probably don't know much about it, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elf City was founded by the ancient elven ancestor over a hundred thousand years ago. Over time, more and more elves have come here to settle and grow. Today, there are nine different clans living in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's the Fire Elf Clan, Ocean Elf Clan, Sylvan Elf Clan, Thunder Elf Clan, Storm Elf Clan, Light Elf Clan, Shadow Elf Clan, and then the Life Elf Clan and Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each clan varies in numbers and strength, and their status in Elf City differs as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most powerful are the Shadow Elf Clan and the Light Elf Clan. They have a moderate number of members but are incredibly strong! The king of the Shadow Elf Clan is currently the lord of Elf City, while the king of the Light Elf Clan is the pope of the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of their might, the Shadow Elf Clan and Light Elf Clan are the ones you definitely don't want to cross. Thankfully, they tend to be aloof and don't meddle in outside affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just below them in power are the Sylvan Elf Clan, Thunder Elf Clan, Fire Elf Clan, and Ocean Elf Clan. They have large populations and considerable influence. While their royal families differ in strength, the gap isn't that wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The weakest clans in Elf City are the Life Elf Clan and the Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because both clans are quite rare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Life Elf Clan is a bit better off; they excel in healing magic, so even though they aren't particularly strong, they hold a high status. Even the Shadow Elf Clan and Light Elf Clan have to treat them with caution, not daring to offend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, in the perilous deep space, no one can guarantee they won't get hurt! And when injuries do occur, they can be severe&mdash;sometimes even a Miracle Elixir won't suffice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you either need to rely on a Sacred Elixir or turn to the Life Elf Clan for help! But Sacred Elixirs are incredibly rare and precious; who can afford to use them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why the Life Elf Clan enjoys such a high standing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for us in the Nature Elf Clan..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
