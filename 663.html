  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was lying in the crevice at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay at the bottom of the crevice, with a massive wound across his body. It almost tore him apart. His chest was open, and his white bones were exposed. Even his internal organs were visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could all be seen clearly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was somewhat unsure. She had seen Osborne use the Light of Redemption and knew how terrifying its effects were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she believed that even if Osborne had returned to his peak condition, he might not have been able to withstand Werewolf's ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked to the edge of the crevice. She looked at Osborne's broken body lying at the bottom, and a cold smile appeared on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, he's dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was just a Class AA, yet he made all five of us attack together. Two died, one was crippled, and the three of us had to use our ultimate moves to finally kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, it's good that he's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After using his ultimate move, Werewolf's energy became weak. His enormous body couldn't be maintained anymore. He reverted to his normal form, staggering slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "That damned freak actually recovered to his peak state during my attack! But it was my ultimate move. He's done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he walked to the edge of the crevice. He looked down at Osborne as if to admire his handiwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Osborne's body start to move slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad, you damned clones can't do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice came from the bottom of the crevice, icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa and Werewolf above the crevice were instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned simultaneously to look at Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Kill him! He's not dead yet! Titan No. 7, use the Self-Sacrificing Punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, their conditions were extremely poor. After using their ultimate moves, their energy was nearly depleted. Only Titan was in relatively good shape. Although he had lost his right arm, his energy was not heavily drained, and he could use his ultimate move again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing this, Titan's face showed hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only had two arms. If he used the ultimate move again, he would have to sacrifice both arms. With no arms left, his strength would be greatly reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His recovery ability is freakish. Don't give him a chance to recover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa shouted when she saw Titan hesitating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> created us to eliminate all his enemies. For that, we can sacrifice our lives at any time. What's one arm compared to that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is only a Class AA, yet he's already this powerful. If we don't kill him and let him grow stronger, he'll be a huge threat to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Titan No. 7, if you hesitate any longer, I'll report you to the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can expect to be destroyed forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Medusa spoke, Titan's expression changed. He no longer hesitated. Flames engulfed his entire body, then surged toward his left arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-Sacrificing Punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's left arm detached from his body instantly, hurtling toward Osborne at the bottom of the crevice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to stand, but it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had used the Light of Redemption to restore himself to peak condition, Werewolf's ultimate move was too terrifying. Surviving it had already pushed him to his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, his body had reached its limit. He was in an even worse condition than Medusa and Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Titan's ultimate move, he could no longer resist. He watched helplessly as Titan's detached left arm came hurtling toward him like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how I'm going to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, I'm going to die? I haven't cured my sister's illness yet! I haven't found my parents! I haven't even slept with Isa or married Clarissa...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't become the Godfather yet. There are so many things I haven't done...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to die like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, time seemed to slow down. Images of the people Osborne cared about most flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew these were memories flashing before death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, he would probably die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, Werewolf, and Titan all sneered at Osborne, convinced he would die soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive trident suddenly pierced through the ground and appeared right in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trident struck upward, slamming into Titan's detached left arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's left arm exploded entirely, sending the trident flying backward, where it crashed heavily into the ground and disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave from the blast surged through the crevice, rushing towards Osborne's broken body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's current condition, even the shockwave would be impossible to withstand.</span></p><div class="pagination">
