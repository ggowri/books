  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Warfare Ancient Tree?" Osborne looked at the excited Primordial in surprise. "Primordial, do you know them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Primordial said, "In the early Chaotic World, my true form was the first being to emerge, followed by numerous other beings, including the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Warfare Ancient Tree is extremely precious. It's called the Warfare Ancient Tree because its entire body can be used for attack and defense, possessing immense power. Moreover, its leaves and fruits can grow into various weapons and armor according to its own will.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When these weapons and defense systems mature, the Warfare Ancient Tree will command them to fight other beings, often achieving great results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The longer the Warfare Ancient Tree lives, the stronger it becomes. This is because, over time, the weapons and armor growing on the Warfare Ancient Tree become increasingly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, the Warfare Ancient Trees in front of you are not very old. Their leaves and fruits lack power, not even qualifying as ordinary divine artifacts, let alone quasi-</span><span>divine artifacts, and are far from reaching the level of Sacred Artifacts. They won't be of much help to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the Warfare Ancient Tree is strong enough, each leaf or fruit could rival a Sacred Artifact or even surpass it. If you encounter such a Warfare Ancient Tree, you've hit the jackpot. As long as you pass its test, you can obtain its leaves and fruits, which is equivalent to directly acquiring a Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's words made Osborne's eyes widen, filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Can the leaves and fruits of the Warfare Ancient Tree grow into weapons and armor comparable to Sacred Artifacts, or even stronger? Can passing the Warfare Ancient Tree's test grant access to the weapons and armor growing on it? How could such a miraculous being exist in this world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the Warfare Ancient Trees in front of him. All their leaves resembled small warships, and each had reached the level of a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Celestara Planet, each Leaf Warship could fetch a high price and was fiercely contested by the major forces on the planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are just too many Leaf Warships here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each Warfare Ancient Tree has tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of leaves, and there are at least hundreds of Warfare Ancient Trees here, equivalent to tens of millions of divine artifact-level Leaf Warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Paramount Supreme Clan had tens of millions of Leaf Warships back then, they would have likely wiped out the Human Community on Celestara Planet long ago. Moreover, the Human Community wouldn't have had any power to resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Human Community had tens of millions of Leaf Warships, they would have wiped out the Paramount Supreme Clan when they first appeared on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, a single Leaf Warship might not be much, but with such vast numbers, their power would be absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, the Fruit Battleship of the Warfare Ancient Tree is even stronger than the Leaf Warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Fruit Battleship is also a divine artifact, it can rival the top-tier divine artifacts, comparable to Sanctum of Light and Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on these hundreds of Warfare Ancient Trees, each has at least ten fruits, amounting to thousands of Fruit Battleships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but feel excited. Those Leaf Warships weren't of much help to Osborne right now. However, if he could obtain those Fruit Battleships and bring them back to Celestara Planet, he could undoubtedly make Celestara Planet countless times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If other forces attacked Celestara Planet, even warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness would likely have no choice but to flee in panic when faced with the siege of these thousands of Fruit Battleships, possibly even losing their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Primordial, as long as I pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree, I can obtain its leaves and fruits, right? What exactly is the test? What do I need to do to take all the fruits from these Warfare Ancient Trees?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Primordial looked at Osborne in surprise. "You want to take all the fruits from these Warfare Ancient Trees? These fruits aren't even ripe yet, not even considered quasi-Sacred Artifacts. They won't be of much help to you. You should at least wait until they reach the Sacredness Level and become Sacred Artifacts before picking them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I'm not taking them for myself. I plan to bring them back to Celestara Planet, hand them over to my grandfather and the others, and enhance the strength of Celestara Planet and the Empire of the Sun."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "The level of these fruits isn't high; they can only be considered top-tier divine artifacts. If you want to pick them, it won't be difficult. With your strength, you should be able to pass the test easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just step into the range of the Warfare Ancient Tree, communicate with it using soul power, and you'll initiate the test. The test of the Warfare Ancient Tree is also a form of training that can help improve your combat skills."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Alright. Let me give it a try."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Osborne walked toward the nearest Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, be careful," Agatha reminded with some concern. She had never seen such peculiar creatures before and was worried Osborne might get hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already approached the Warfare Ancient Tree. Although Primordial had said it wouldn't be difficult for him to pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne remained cautious. He summoned the Eclipse War Armor for defense and tightly gripped the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After approaching the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne truly felt how massive it was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each Warfare Ancient Tree seemed to him like a massive mountain, even a mountain filled with divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. Following Primordial's guidance, he channeled his soul power to communicate with the Warfare Ancient Tree. Instantly, he felt an incredibly powerful aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a voice echoed in his mind. "Challenger, what do you seek from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was quite surprised, thinking, "Is this the Warfare Ancient Tree speaking?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Warfare Ancient Tree could speak, he could sense that its intelligence was not high, more like a preset program running on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried to communicate with it further, but it gave no response at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only say, "I want all your fruits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Challenger, you are too greedy. If you want all my fruits, it depends on whether you have the strength and the qualification to make my fruits fight for you," said the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt the surroundings change. He found himself on a massive arena. In front of him were the ten fruits from the Warfare Ancient Tree, which were the ten enormous warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warfare Ancient Tree said, "Challenger, these are the projections of my fruits. If you want to take all my fruits, you must first defeat these projections. If you can't, the trial fails. You must leave something of equal value. Otherwise, you will have to leave your life behind."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne's expression immediately changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If I fail the trial, I have to leave something of equal value? If I can't, I have to leave my life? Primordial never mentioned this to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne could no longer back down. Besides, they were just ten supreme divine artifact-level warships. With Osborne's current strength, dealing with them shouldn't be too difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "Come on."</span></p><div class="pagination">
