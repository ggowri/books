  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley shared a look of shock and dismay as they witnessed the unexpected scene unfolding before them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could Osborne be Clarissa&rsquo;s savior?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s thoughts raced with disbelief and a tinge of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watching Clarissa, the aloof and unapproachable figure, now clinging to Osborne in tears, she felt a surge of bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was the one she&rsquo;d been trying so hard to impress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, on the other hand, was the ex-husband she looked down upon, the failure for whom she initiated divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They seemed worlds apart, yet here they were, embracing each other, with Clarissa taking the lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a cough interrupted the emotional moment, causing Clarissa to startle like a frightened rabbit, quickly pulling away from Osborne&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Turning towards the source of the sound, she lowered her head, resembling a child caught in mischief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A middle-aged woman scolded, her expression stern, catching everyone off guard, &ldquo;Clarissa, you are being too impulsive.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She carried a serious demeanor, a familiar figure often seen nearby, tending to her flowers with a watering can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The trio had mistaken her for a gardener. But now, witnessing her scold Clarissa like a child left them all stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt Donna, I&rsquo;m sorry. I was just overwhelmed meeting my savior at last. I&rsquo;ll be more composed from now on,&rdquo; Clarissa addressed the middle-aged woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nodded, her eyes shifting towards Osborne, a mix of scrutiny and wariness in her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne felt a surge of danger and a jolt from Satan&rsquo;s eye, much like when he had first encountered Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized that this middle-aged woman was the true force to reckon with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Clarissa seemed respectful and somewhat fearful of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He pondered many thoughts but maintained a calm facade, meeting the middle-aged woman&rsquo;s gaze steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, right? Thank you for saving our Clarissa fifteen years ago. I&rsquo;m Donna Radcliffe, Clarissa&rsquo;s aunt. The Radcliffe family never hesitates to repay a debt of gratitude.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s words confirmed Osborne&rsquo;s suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words left Ophelia and Wesley gazing enviously at Osborne, with Wesley&rsquo;s jealousy reaching a boiling point, his eyes bloodshot with envy, and his face contorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why wasn&rsquo;t it me who saved Clarissa?</span> he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">If I had been her savior, the Radcliffe family would have granted me any wish I desired. My life would have soared to new heights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe I would even win Clarissa&rsquo;s heart</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley glared at Osborne as if his gaze could inflict harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you want. Whatever the Radcliffe family can provide, we will fulfill. Money? Power? Or perhaps a beauty? Just name it, and we won&rsquo;t owe you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, calmly stating, &ldquo;You misunderstand. Though I saved Ms. Radcliffe, I never sought any repayment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna furrowed her brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you truly want nothing, or do you want everything?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After speaking, she glanced at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, a blush spread across Clarissa&rsquo;s face as she understood the implication, feeling a sense of urgency. &ldquo;Aunt Donna, how can you think like that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa, I&rsquo;m just worried about you. You&rsquo;re still too young, too naive. I fear you might be deceived. You&rsquo;re the eldest child of your parents, everything will be yours in the future. I worry that someone might deceive you, taking both you and the family fortune.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finishing her words, she cast a cautious look towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt speechless. Donna was clearly worried that he might take advantage of being Clarissa&rsquo;s savior to deceive her emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Marrying Clarissa would mean gaining everything from the Radcliffe family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you 100 million dollars, consider it repaying your favor from fifteen years ago. Of course, if you encounter trouble in the future or wish to start a business, you can come to me. I will represent the Radcliffe family and assist you as much as possible,&rdquo; Donna said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point, Wesley and Ophelia were even more envious, wishing they could replace Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne remained calm. &ldquo;Is this generosity genuine? There must be a catch, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was somewhat surprised by Osborne&rsquo;s composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She nodded, saying, &ldquo;If you have no ulterior motives, the cost is nothing to you. I just hope that after taking the money, you won&rsquo;t come looking for Clarissa again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m quite straightforward. I&rsquo;m Clarissa&rsquo;s aunt, and she has recently encountered some unfortunate events. I must ensure her absolute safety. I hope you understand.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa couldn&rsquo;t hold back, furrowing her brows and protesting loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt Donna, Osborne is the savior I&rsquo;ve been searching for fifteen years. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be allowed to see me? I&rsquo;m an adult now, you have no right to control me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression turned serious at Clarissa&rsquo;s words.</p><div class="pagination">
