  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy One finished speaking, the Human Alliance fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice seemed to carry a mesmerizing power and coupled with the outcomes of today's eight matches, many began to reflect deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Resistance&mdash;is there any hope?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would surrendering to the Paramount Supreme Clan be a better choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, God of Light, sensing the danger, let out a cold snort, interrupting Icy One's speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One shut your mouth!" she snapped. "Surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan? Do you even deserve it? We know how the Human Community are treated in the territories under your control. Do you think we are blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You enslave humans, treating us as inferior beings! If we surrender, we will be nothing more than livestock to you&mdash;lowly slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget&mdash;you are invaders!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Celestara belongs to the Human Community! A thousand years ago, it was your Paramount Supreme Clan that led the hundred tribes to invade, massacring ninety percent of the human population and seizing our lands and cities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are invaders who slaughtered and oppressed us, and now you want us to surrender? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are right about one thing&mdash;your strength is indeed greater. But so what? As long as we can fight, we will never let you have your way! The Human Community would rather die than beg to live! We would rather bleed as free people than survive as slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But tomorrow, we will fight again! You will never crush our will to resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's impassioned words echoed through the heavens, reaching every member of the Human Alliance. Those who had been wavering now showed guilt and self-reproach on their faces, while the steadfast ones glared at Icy One and the Unity Clan across from them with fury in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right! We would rather die than beg to live!" Jethro shouted passionately, his voice trembling with emotion. "Icy One, this is just the first day. Tomorrow, the Human Community will defeat you! You will never break us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited even more people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chorus of voices rose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want the Human Community to surrender? Dream on! A thousand years could not crush us, and a single day's defeat will not either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep dreaming on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Celestara belongs to the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, we will drive you all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rallying cries grew louder as the Human Alliance regained its morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light exhaled in relief at the sight, but she knew this energy would not last. She thought, "If they keep losing in the upcoming border competition, morale will plummet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morale is not built on words alone; it thrives on victories, confidence, and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about tomorrow's matches? Who can secure wins for the Human Community, keeping the Human Alliance's spirits high and their fighting intact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I do not know... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Icy One scoffed, his expression darkening. He had not expected his words to provoke such a fiery response from God of Light nor for the Human Alliance to regain their morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "In the face of overwhelming strength, continued victories in the border competition will erode the Human Community's morale until no speech, no matter how impassioned, can save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, even if the Human Community refuses to surrender, their spirit will crushed, and their fighting will drained. Then, leading the Dark Deity Legion, I will easily overrun the West Zone, slaughtering the resistances and enslaving the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one can stand against the Dark Deity Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence has given me three months to conquer the West Zone. I will spend the first month undermining the prodigies and the morale of the Human Community through this border competition. Then, I will crush them completely!" Smirking, Icy One said, "God of Light, your words are meaningless. The fact remains&mdash;you have lost. Now, retreat your forces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull back four million miles&mdash;no less!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The duel continues tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light glared at him coldly. "No need for your reminders. Tomorrow, we will fight again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to her forces and raised her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All soldiers of the Human Community, hear my command: retreat four million miles! This retreat is temporary. One day, we will reclaim every inch of lost land!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her orders, the Human Alliance began a massive retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Light Airships, capable of short-range interdimensional travel, the retreat was swift, and the defensive line pulled back by four million miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Dark Deity Legion advanced the same distance, again facing off at just under six thousand miles apart. A massive viewing platform rose between them&mdash;the battlefield for tomorrow's border competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light hovered above the Human Alliance, where an intense meeting was underway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear it. What are your thoughts on today's matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light sat on her throne, her brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below her, the leaders of various factions sat in silence, their faces grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one has anything to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed, "Then I will speak. From today's eight matches, it is clear we are outmatched. Even in fair fights, we won only one out of eight. We were completely overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must acknowledge the gap in strength, but we cannot lose hope. Several matches were close&mdash;we almost won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words lightened the mood slightly, but the leaders' optimism waned as they remembered that their fighters were the cream of the crop while the opponents had not even fielded their top talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's discuss strategies for tomorrow's matches," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted into a heated debate.</span></p><div class="pagination">
