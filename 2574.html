  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chaotic battles of the first eight groups were fast-paced, but the results were unsurprising.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight princes and princesses displayed immense strength, far surpassing the other contestants, easily securing first place in each group without any surprises.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight princes and princesses all ranked first in their groups. They achieved first place with overwhelming dominance, leaving no chance for other contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left the contestants almost in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel began, they accepted that the top nine spots on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings would be dominated by the nine princes and princesses, but they didn't believe the gap between them and the royals would be so vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone is at the same cultivation level, so even if there's a gap, it shouldn't be too wide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the truth proved that the gap between them was so vast it was hard for them to accept.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are warriors who stood out in the zone duel, but compared to the princes and princesses, they seem so weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only Seraphina, who could defeat Mason with a single move barehanded, but the other princes and princesses also displayed abilities far beyond theirs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each prince and princess wields at least a Legendary Sacred Artifact, with high affinity for it, unleashing its full power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their combat skills are also impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One princess even brought out a Supreme Sacred Artifact and seemed capable of using it in battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she replaced the Supreme Sacred Artifact with a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This already proves that the princess possesses the strength to wield a Supreme Sacred Artifact. She simply felt her opponent wasn't strong enough to warrant its use, so she switched to a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a situation almost made the participants despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the participants, only Mason could barely wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact, unleashing a small portion of its power, while most others could only manage a Superior Sacred Artifact, with some even limited to a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All nine princes and princesses could wield Legendary Sacred Artifacts, unleashing most of their power, and might even be capable of handling Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap between them was too vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the chaotic battles of the eight groups concluded, and no one managed to threaten the eight princes and princesses, securing first place in their groups.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a single person like that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was Mason, ranked tenth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Casey, ranked eleventh, or others in the top twenty of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, all suffered crushing defeats.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was almost certain that the nine princes and princesses would ultimately secure first place in their groups, dominating the top nine spots in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, while the others were truly competing for the tenth place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the ninth group's seed player, Yvonne, ranked ninth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, was already standing on the stage. The other members of the ninth group quickly followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They glanced at Yvonne and quickly looked away. In their gazes toward Yvonne, there was no fighting spirit, as they knew they could never be a match for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Yvonne was the weakest among the nine princes and princesses, she could still easily defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They think Yvonne must win the group and they can only fight for second place. Their goal is to defeat everyone but Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, someone kept staring at Yvonne, and that person was Clara!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara stared at Yvonne, her eyes full of fighting spirit. Whether from nervousness, excitement, or something else, her body was trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed eager to start attacking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her behavior instantly left everyone on the stage stunned. Then, upon realizing it was Clara, disdain appeared on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man sneered, "She's Clara, ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. And she dares to show fighting spirit toward Princess Yvonne? Does she actually intend to attack Princess Yvonne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman mocked, "How ridiculous! She's ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. Anyone in Group Nine could easily defeat her in no more than three moves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, she got into the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel by luck. Her strength is far behind the others participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man laughed and said, "She probably knows she'll be easily defeated no matter who she faces, so she chose the strongest, Princess Yvonne, as her opponent. This way, even if she loses or gets defeated in one move, she can tell herself it was because Princess Yvonne was too powerful. How ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, hearing the crowd's discussion, Yvonne also curiously looked at Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing Clara's fighting spirit, she sneered, "You actually have fighting spirit toward me. It seems the battles in the first eight groups didn't make you realize the vast gap between ordinary cultivators like you and us princes and princesses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, you're ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. How dare someone like you have fighting spirit toward me? Are you looking down on me? Are you insulting me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Yvonne unleashed an incredibly powerful aura, fiercely oppressing Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara felt a bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the person in front of her held a very high status in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, being a princess, and this princess was indeed very powerful. Although her strength had improved significantly during this time, she hadn't fought anyone yet and had no idea what level her abilities had truly reached.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, facing Yvonne's aura, she felt a bit uncertain and thought, "Perhaps, I might not be her match at all. I'll be easily defeated by her, become a joke, and be ridiculed by others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Clara began to doubt herself in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear and timidity were evident on her face. She didn't even dare to meet Yvonne's gaze anymore and wanted to look away. Her fighting spirit gradually faded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation immediately drew mocking laughter from the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man laughed and said, "Since you're ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, you need to know your place. You're here to be a joke, a backdrop for others."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman mocked, "After being scared by Princess Yvonne, you finally realized your place. How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their words made Clara even more insecure, her gaze becoming more evasive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne's voice suddenly echoed in her mind. "Clara, don't be afraid. You're not inferior to her. In fact, you're even stronger now. These people mock you because they're ignorant and foolish. They all think you're ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. So, you should show your strength and let them see how powerful you are. Don't be afraid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words were incredibly gentle yet full of strength, instantly making Clara lift her gaze to meet Yvonne's eyes once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face once again showed a fighting spirit. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne said I'm stronger than her now. I should let those who look down on me know whether I'm really ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. I'm strong now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Clara's gaze no longer held any timidity but was instead filled with confidence and determination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Let's begin. I will take first place in Group Nine."</span></p><div class="pagination">
