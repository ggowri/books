  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the leadership structure of the Draco Armed Services Branch was established, Osborne decided to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that point on, the branch's growth would depend entirely on the capabilities of its new leaders. Aside from offering necessary support, he wouldn't interfere too much; his focus remained on the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, Mr. Clarkson, let me take you to our training ground! There, you can refine your Divine Bone and Divine Flesh much faster, paving the way for you to forge your Divine Body and break through to become a Junior Deity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and Bryce perked up at the mention of the training ground, their excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Sebastian exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want to go too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Wesson, and the others were equally curious, eager to see what Osborne was talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, let's go together!" Osborne said with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he effortlessly opened a dimensional rift, leading the group through. In the blink of an eye, they found themselves 12 miles beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was where Osborne had discovered the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy density here was at least a hundred times greater than that on the surface, and the very air felt thick with power. Just one breath would make an ordinary person feel their strength surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they took in their surroundings, Sebastian, Bryce, and the others were left in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This truly is a training paradise!" Sebastian marveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I train here, I bet I could forge my Divine Body in just a week, maybe even less!" Bryce said, practically bouncing with excitement as he prepared to sit down and begin his training immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, stopping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, you can't rush the process of forging your Divine Body! Did you know there are different levels to it? In fact, there are nine levels in total."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce blinked, clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Different levels?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine levels?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at Osborne with curiosity, eager for an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly laid it out for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when you break through to Junior Deity, the higher the level of your forged Divine Body, the stronger your abilities will be, and the greater your future potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are specific methods to forge the Divine Body! Luckily, I have some excellent techniques at my disposal. If you follow these methods, you'll be able to create a stronger and higher-level Divine Body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement rippled through the group, especially for Sebastian and Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, they had no idea that forging a Divine Body was so intricate. They had simply thought they could refine it casually to meet the requirements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were eager to create the most powerful Divine Body they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne went on to detail the technique he had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This method was called Phoenix Ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had found it in Cain's memory, and it was one of the most powerful techniques out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the Age of Gods, Phoenix Ascension was renowned as an exceptional body-refining method, treasured by Cain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Phoenix Ascension during the forging process could elevate the level of one's Divine Body by two levels!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, with Bryce's natural talent, if he were to forge his Divine Body without any methods, he might end up with a Level Two or Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was already impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only true prodigies could achieve a Level Two or Level Three Divine Body; most people only managed a Level One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, with his prodigious talent, would certainly forge a Divine Body stronger than most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even he had hit the ceiling at a Level Three Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bryce harnessed the power of Phoenix Ascension, he could boost his Divine Body by two levels, potentially reaching a Level Four or even a Level Five Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference between a Level Five Divine Body and a Level Three Divine Body was staggering&mdash;one could outperform the other by over ten times in combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd be operating on entirely different planes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real kicker? Achieving a Level Five Divine Body as a Junior Deity would set </span><span>Bryce up for unimaginable potential. He could continue to refine his Divine Body using Phoenix Ascension, pushing its strength to its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was even a chance he could reach the ultimate Level Eight Galactic Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many Deity Kings could only claim a Level Seven Solar Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bryce secured a Level Five Divine Body at this stage, he'd have a clear path to the Deity King realm, assuming he stayed alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incredible power of Phoenix Ascension was now sinking in for the group, and they were left utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes gleamed with fervor and ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cautioned, his voice serious, "Listen up, folks. Phoenix Ascension is a treasure beyond measure. Use it wisely and keep it under wraps. No leaks! The last thing we need is outsiders catching wind of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only share it with those you absolutely trust, got it? Otherwise, keep it to yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all nodded, the gravity of the situation clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, it's your turn to give it a shot. I'll hang back and keep an eye on things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scanned the surroundings, Osborne couldn't shake the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it about this place that possesses such dense energy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
