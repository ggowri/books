  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned his head upon hearing this and looked at Aiden.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why would Aiden be so kind as to guide me? But the direction he pointed to is indeed where the Supreme Sacred Artifacts are stored, which is easy to verify."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Aiden hates me and wants to kill me, there's absolutely no need to lie about this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It&rsquo;s meaningless and won&rsquo;t waste much of my time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really couldn&rsquo;t understand why Aiden, who clearly wanted to get rid of him immediately, would instead choose to help him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "There's no way he'd help me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Probably, he just purely wants to talk to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne gave a faint smile, ignored it, and walked straight in the opposite direction of where Aiden pointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Aiden's face instantly froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" He snorted coldly and said in a flat tone, "I kindly gave you directions, yet you ignored me. You're really a rude guy! Are all people named Osborne this lowly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Aiden closed his eyes and patiently waited for time to pass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The time to exchange treasures is only two hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each treasure is shrouded in a formation, and even a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cannot obtain the Sacred Artifact within without breaking the formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Aiden has no need to worry about any issues with the treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury is simply too vast; searching for Michelle's relic one by one would be far too difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Let alone two hours, even if Osborne were given two days, he might not be able to quickly examine all the Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with Satan's Eye, it's a completely different story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye can penetrate shelves and Sacred Artifacts, instantly scanning all treasures in the entire area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, while others need time to identify the grade, effects, and strength of a Sacred Artifact, Osborne only needs a sweep with Satan's Eye, and the relevant information clearly appears in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plus, with his targets being necklaces, rings, and tokens, the search range is greatly reduced, naturally increasing the chances of finding Michelle's relic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used Satan's Eye to quickly scan all the necklaces, rings, and tokens among the Sacred Artifacts in the treasury, taking very little time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scanned while thinking, "Hope everything goes smoothly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Royal Treasury is divided into thousands of sections, with each section containing hundreds to millions of Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Osborne didn't know the grade of Michelle's relic, he could only start searching one by one from the area storing low-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used Satan's Eye to quickly scan all the Sacred Artifacts in the current area. After eliminating other distractions, he focused on the necklaces, rings, and tokens, confirmed they weren't Michelle's relic, and swiftly moved on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, Osborne quickly searched through hundreds of sections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of these sections stored Inferior Sacred Artifacts. Although there were many necklaces, rings, and tokens, none matched Michelle's relic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was not in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He firmly believed that as long as Michelle's relic was in this treasury, he would find it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there was still plenty of time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne searched through hundreds more sections, checking every place storing Inferior Sacred Artifacts, but still found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems those are not Inferior Sacred Artifacts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked into the area storing Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts. It was still empty here. He quickly scanned with Satan's Eye, and after confirming Michelle's relic wasn't there, he continued deeper inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, more than half an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, Osborne had searched every area storing Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts but still hadn't found any of Michelle's relics.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could they not be Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts but Superior Sacred Artifacts instead?" Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Mother was just an ordinary maid in the palace back then, with a cultivation level that wasn't high, probably only reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness. How could her relics all be Superior Sacred Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found this hard to believe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the number of Superior Sacred Artifacts is far fewer than low-grade and mid-grade ones, so searching shouldn't take too much time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, he thoroughly searched the area storing the Superior Sacred Artifacts as well, and his expression gradually grew serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nothing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still nothing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the Superior Sacred Artifact storage area, Osborne still couldn't find any relics belonging to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He speculated, "Could it be that mother's relics are not in the treasury at all but were taken by someone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, his gaze fixed ahead. That was where the Legendary Sacred Artifacts were stored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, many participants of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel were inside, selecting Legendary Sacred Artifacts, their expressions conflicted, clearly unsure of what to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he didn't believe Michelle's relics would be Legendary Sacred Artifacts, since the previous areas yielded nothing, he had no choice but to search the entire treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye quickly scanned the area where the Legendary Sacred Artifacts were stored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Treasury held 280,000 Legendary Sacred Artifacts, divided into three different areas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the first area, Osborne quickly scanned with Satan's Eye but found nothing. He entered the second area and checked carefully again, but still came up empty-handed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's mood grew heavier as he stepped into the final area storing the Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Satan's Eye swept across again, Osborne suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep within this area, on an unremarkable wooden shelf, a carved ring lay quietly. The ring, besides featuring a blooming purple flower, was also engraved with patterns of a Sacred Dragon, a phoenix, and other intricate designs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze locked onto the ring, his body trembling slightly, and his eyes even reddened a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I finally found it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's this ring!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clearly remembered that this ring was Michelle's favorite accessory during her lifetime. She always wore it on the ring finger of her left hand. Every time Michelle held his hand, he could feel the ring pressing slightly, and he had repeatedly urged Michelle to take it off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she always smiled and shook her head, telling him that this ring could not be taken off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was her most important possession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's why Osborne's memory of this ring was so vivid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was about to step forward to take the ring when he suddenly noticed a contestant also standing in front of the ring, carefully examining it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't bother to think about who that person was and immediately sprinted over. If Michelle's ring was redeemed by someone else using Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, it would be hard to get it back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the woman was staring at the ring in a daze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to really like the item, bit her lip, then took out a Kingdom Duel Token, ready to place it on the ring's defense formation to complete the exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne became anxious immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He moved in a flash, instantly appearing in front of the woman, grabbing her wrist, and said, "Wait! I want this ring!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he raised his head to look at the woman's face and was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is it her?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
