  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett's expression was as cold as ice, a deadly aura radiating from her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get ready! I'm going to handle this myself! Mose was one of my own, and if Osborne dares to kill him, not only will I ruin his Honor Quest Ceremony, but I'll also make him pay with his life! The Lambert family will pay a price as well."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her subordinates' faces paled at her words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your Highness, please! You're too important to risk like this. Let us handle it. We'll make sure Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony is ruined and take out the Lambert family for sure.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett waved her hand dismissively."Do you doubt my abilities? Hmph! This time, I'm going in myself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her subordinates exchanged worried glances, their anxiety palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your Highness, if something were to happen to you, we wouldn't be able to bear the consequences!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett snapped, her voice icy, "Enough! You still don't trust my strength! It seems I haven't fought in so long that even you've begun to question me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the perfect opportunity for me to boost my ranking on the Godson Rankings! I might not aim for the very top, but breaking into the top fifty should be well within my reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Plus, with my stealth abilities, even if I run into a Class S Supreme Overlord, I can slip away without a hitch. Nothing could go wrong!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her subordinates still looked uneasy, still wanting to talked her out of this.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett's voice was firm. "No buts! This is an order! Get me a flight to Rosmandi. I'm leaving today."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Your Highness!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Scarlett's fury, her subordinates quickly fell silent. Her position in the Eityreia Organization was far too elevated for them to defy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shortly after, a helicopter took off, carrying Scarlett and a group of elite assassins toward Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Marcelin, the Thornberry family stood as the most powerful Divine Family, their influence unmatched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their castle was built atop the revered Titan Peak, a mountain that spanned thousands of acres, entirely belonging to the Thornberry family, inaccessible to ordinary folks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the castle, excitement buzzed in the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brother, you're finally back!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's face lit up with joy as she saw her handsome brother emerge from the safe house.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was Marlon Thornberry, the heir of the Thornberry family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon held the 40th spot on the Godson Rankings, making him the second strongest among the younger generation, just behind Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that was before he entered seclusion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After participating in Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony, Marlon had locked himself away to break through to Class S. Although he hadn't succeeded, his power had still increased significantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do you feel?" Ebony asked, her eyes wide with anticipation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon smiled, an overwhelming energy emanating from him. Shadows of sun appeared behind him, making it hard for anyone to look directly at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony felt an immense pressure wash over her, her shock evident.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon replied, still smiling, "I feel great! Though I didn't break through to Class S this time, I can sense that I'm incredibly close! Give me a month at most, and I'll definitely become a Class S Supreme Overlord."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon stood tall, his confidence radiating as he declared, "I'm absolutely certain I can break into the top twenty of the Godson Rankings&mdash;maybe even the top ten! Among the younger generation, no one stands a chance against me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's eyes sparkled with excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's awesome, brother! You've got to avenge me! That damn Osborne had the nerve to hit me! No one's ever dared to lay a hand on me before!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fierce glint flashed in her eyes as she recalled the image of Osborne striking her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her teeth clenched in anger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon's expression darkened in response.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, sis. I'll make him pay! Fatebearer is mine! How dare he try to take her from me? He's asking for trouble!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going straight to Rosmandi to bring Fatebearer back! And I'll grab Osborne, too, so you can handle him! I'm the heir of the Thornberry family, and I'm not letting the Augustine family stop me!&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's excitement grew palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to go with you! Just got the invitation from the Augustine family; they're throwing an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne had the audacity to strike me, so I'll turn his Honor Quest Ceremony into a spectacle of humiliation! I'll make him the biggest joke in front of all the young elites! I'll stomp him into the ground and humiliate him, torture him for everyone to see!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hate radiated from Ebony as she spoke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon raised an eyebrow, a smirk creeping onto his face. "Another Honor Quest Ceremony, huh? What a joke! With his level of skill, he thinks he can pull that off?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's crash his little party!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And while we're at it, let's bring Fatebearer back, too."</p><div class="pagination">
