  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect timing! The Hudson family is in a bit of a bind right now. They're short on Celestial Crystals! Who knows, they might just be willing to sell you that military map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Xanto turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto couldn't quite understand why he had shared so much with a young man. In his previous life, he would have never done such a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It puzzled him. There was something about Osborne that stirred an inexplicable fondness within him, a desire to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's because the Human Community is facing its most perilous times, and I feel drawn to these young, talented, and fearless individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, their future is our future!" Xanto reasoned with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did Xanto mean by that? Go to the Hudson family? They have military maps? Luminous Commerce Center can't sell me one because it's against the rules, but the Hudson family can? And they're in need of money?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself, casting another glance at the map from the Luminous Commerce Center, still feeling dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'll check out the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I met Tristan before&mdash;he may not have a high status there, but it's a start! If I can snag a military map from them, that'd be great. If not... well, I can always come back for this one, which at least serves its purpose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne made his way to the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please follow me! Mr. Hodge specifically instructed me to escort you out through the back door!" the sales associate said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, shaking his head. "No need for that! I'll just head out the front. Isn't Kurt waiting for me? I'm curious to see what he's planning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales associate frowned, clearly troubled by his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand dismissively. "This is my choice, and it's got nothing to do with you! Please thank Mr. Hodge for me. By the way, I'm really satisfied with your service. Here, take this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he tossed something to the sales associate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She caught it quickly, and when she realized what it was, her eyes went wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a Celestial Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One whole Celestial Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales associate was overwhelmed with excitement. As just an ordinary sales clerk, her high salary and commissions at the Luminous Commerce Center amounted to around ten top-grade Essence Crystals each month&mdash;roughly equivalent to 100 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While that was already a decent income, a single Celestial Crystal was worth an astounding one hundred million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like her, it would take nearly a thousand years of work to earn just one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Osborne, casually handing one over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a surge of gratitude as she watched him walk away, bowing deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved back without looking, quickly making his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, a Celestial Crystal was just a drop in the bucket, but for her, it could change her destiny. With that crystal, she could easily reach the peak of Deity Overlord and even have a shot at breaking through to Deity King in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped out through the front door of the Luminous Commerce Center, he quickly forgot about the encounter, his focus shifting to the waiting figure outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was there, leaning against a wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just what I needed! I was wondering how to get my hands on the Hammer of Thor, and here you are, walking right into my trap. I won't be polite about it..." Osborne murmured to himself, determination flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt stood outside the Luminous Commerce Center, his face brooding, eyes locked on the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An aura of menace surrounded him, radiating a palpable sense of danger that sent others scurrying away. It was clear to anyone nearby that he was seething with rage, and no one wanted to be caught in the crossfire of his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice rang out, breaking the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's coming! He's coming! That bastard is finally about to show his face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's eyes narrowed as he turned to see Osborne swaggering out of the Luminous Commerce Center, completely unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt sneered, saying, "Ha! Look at him, acting all tough! Surround him! I want him begging for mercy at my feet! Make him lick my shoes and regret ever crossing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold, commanding tone, Kurt ordered his group of a dozen young men to move in. They rushed forward, quickly encircling Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calm and composed, Osborne regarded the advancing Kurt with an indifferent expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?" he asked, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt wore a malicious grin. "What do I want? Oh, you're in for it now! I told you I'd make you regret this! You think you can stand against me without facing the consequences? Are you scared yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over all your Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs, and then grovel at my feet! If you can make me happy, I might just let you off easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll make your life a living hell! You'll learn what it means to cross me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Kurt's expression was one of arrogant triumph, convinced he had all the power in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that Osborne's only option was to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Refusal meant death.</span></p><div class="pagination">
