  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's analysis brought a sobering reality to those who had been holding onto a glimmer of hope for a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Let's be real. Clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony is no walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Osborne has racked up 110 consecutive wins, and he's just 18 challengers away from clearing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't forget, the competition only gets tougher from here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added, "Those final 18 challengers are all top-tier fighters, each capable of ranking in the top hundreds of the Godson Rankings&mdash;some even in the top eighty. Every single one of them has reached the pinnacle of Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They might not be able to take down a Class S Supreme Overlord, but they can definitely hold their own for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not forget Marlon waiting in the wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His strength puts him in contention for the top ten of the Godson Rankings. Even </span><span>a</span><span> average Class S Supreme Overlord wouldn't stand a chance against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Osborne really defeat Marlon after already exhausting himself against so many?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubt crept in, and it was clear that no one believed he could pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, many feared he might falter before even facing Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena erupted as fierce battles broke out. Each challenger threw everything they had at Osborne, trying to drain his strength. Osborne, however, found himself in a tough spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The increasing strength of his opponents meant that without revealing his trump cards, it would be hard to dispatch them quickly. But using those trump cards came at a cost&mdash;it took a toll on his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne didn't use his hidden abilities, he'd be stuck in a grueling war of attrition, wearing himself down in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fights turned into a battle of endurance, and with every opponent he defeated, Osborne felt the strain on his energy levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breaths grew more labored, and his complexion paled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he truly grasped the brutal nature of the Honor Quest Ceremony's relentless gauntlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Thank goodness we can't use divine artifacts during this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If each challenger had a defensive divine artifact, I'd be utterly drained by now. But even without them, clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony is a monumental challenge. I bet even a genuine Class S Supreme Overlord would struggle to succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, rapidly absorbing star power to replenish his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the energy he regained barely matched the energy Osborne was losing. Each fight </span><span>left him more fatigued than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his strength was still formidable enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the heavy toll, he managed to keep winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached his 118th consecutive victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only ten challengers remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, however, Osborne had already burned through a significant portion of his energy. Without hesitation, he decided to use his Light of Redemption for the first time, instantly restoring himself to peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in astonishment at the display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marlon merely chuckled. "Don't worry. That kind of powerful recovery skill can't be used on a whim! There's definitely a cooldown period. He won't be able to pull that trick again anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the battle continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>119</span><span style="vertical-align: super;">th</span><span> victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>120</span><span style="vertical-align: super;">th</span><span> victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>121</span><span style="vertical-align: super;">st</span><span> victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's winning streak grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of challengers dwindled, bringing him closer to a flawless completion of the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the strength of his opponents was also on the rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from his Light Realm ability and the Divine Bone on his right foot, Osborne had nearly exhausted all his other trump cards. Even so, it took immense effort to defeat each challenger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring another grueling half-hour, Osborne activated Light of Redemption for the second time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon couldn't help but chuckle at the scene. "His Light of Redemption can only be used once every half hour! We can't let him stall any longer. We need to end this quickly and drain his strength as fast as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining challengers nodded in agreement, shifting their strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone were the days of playing it safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to unleash their trump cards and force Osborne to expend his energy rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a minute, the outcome of the challenge would be decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne's winning streak reached an impressive 126 victories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only two challengers remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it had only been five minutes since he last used Light of Redemption, and he'd need at least twenty-five more minutes before he could access it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his strength was already down by forty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy seriousness etched itself across Osborne's face as he sized up his last two opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Bradley and Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A formidable contender, Bradley was Gerardo's third disciple and held the 46th spot in the Godson Rankings. When Osborne defeated Felicity, Bradley had vowed to </span><span>avenge her, and he was no slouch; his strength was certainly on par with Scarlett's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley stepped onto the stage with a determined stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his eyes on Osborne with a cold smile. "So, it's finally my turn? Osborne, I told you I'd get my revenge. Everything you did to Felicity&mdash;I'm going to return it all to you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
