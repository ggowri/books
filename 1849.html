  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, why so quiet? Afraid to bid? Lacking confidence, are we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, make your move! I'm waiting!" Osborne taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt felt a surge of anger at Osborne's words. He thought, "This jerk is just waiting for me to bid so he can undercut me and humiliate me again. But not this time. I'll wait for him to make the first move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white Miracle Elixir was a life-saver, and he knew Osborne wouldn't be able to resist bidding for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Kurt let out a cold snort, completely ignoring Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent, refusing to bid first, patiently waiting for Osborne to make the opening move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time ticked by slowly as the auction continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a higher bid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going twice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going thr..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Kurt's face. He was sure Osborne would jump in at the last second, just like before. It was a tactic Osborne had used many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne bid, Kurt would pounce, outbidding him and relishing the chance to humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, that moment never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer's gavel fell, Kurt's heart sank. He had been so focused on waiting for Osborne that he hadn't even considered the possibility that Osborne might not bid at all. Panic set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, his voice rising in desperation, "Wait! I haven't bid yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll offer two thousand five hundred Celestial Crystals! I want that white Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer responded calmly, "I'm sorry, but the gavel has fallen. The white Miracle Elixir now belongs to the winning bidder. If you're interested, there's another one coming up. Please bid promptly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's face darkened with fury as he glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! Why didn't you bid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, shrugging nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I? My goal here was to stop you from getting the Miracle Elixir. After all, down in the lobby, you and your lackey were saying I couldn't afford it. I just wanted to show you that I could, but since you didn't bid, why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words dripped with sarcasm, and Kurt felt his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought for sure that Osborne would give in to temptation and bid, considering the value of the white Miracle Elixir. But Osborne had actually held back, and now Kurt had lost out on a priceless opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The white Miracle Elixir! And it went to Tristan of the Hudson family for a mere 200 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was shaking with rage, pointing a trembling finger at Osborne, nearly choking on his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Tristan was practically buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer's gavel came down, he could hardly believe his luck. He thought, "I have actually bought a white Miracle Elixir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for just 200 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a price so low it seemed impossible. Even if he had to pay double or triple, getting his hands on the elixir would have been a steal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But more importantly, with the white Miracle Elixir in his possession, there was hope for his father's recovery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan turned to Osborne, his eyes shining with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't encouraged him to bid, he would have never dared to try. He thought he'd only be setting himself up for humiliation at Kurt's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, against all odds, he had secured the elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you! Thank you so much, Theodore! I couldn't have gotten that white Miracle Elixir without you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly appreciate it! If you ever need anything from me, don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan was practically bursting with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No need to be so formal. I just couldn't stand that guy. The fact that the white Miracle Elixir is in your hands now is what matters. You should head back. Your father's injuries can't be delayed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan nodded, gratitude shining in his eyes as he looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, please give me your terminal contact number. Once my father recovers, I'd love to treat you to dinner as a proper thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod, Osborne shared his terminal number, and Tristan, full of urgency to save his father, rushed backstage at the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After quickly collecting the white Miracle Elixir, he made his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the auction continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the second white Miracle Elixir, Kurt had learned his lesson from before. Without hesitation, he raised his bidding paddle early, anticipating Osborne's inevitable counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as expected, Osborne jumped in with his trademark taunts and derision, which only fueled Kurt's frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Kurt was more determined than ever to secure the white Miracle Elixir. When Osborne pushed the bid to nine thousand Celestial Crystals, Kurt shot back without a moment's pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand!" he called out, his voice ringing with conviction. At ten thousand Celestial Crystals, Kurt knew he was already overpaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a normal market, the elixir would typically go for around six thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he was unwilling to let Osborne have the last laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kurt's fierce determination, Osborne decided to back off. After all, the white Miracle Elixir didn't hold much value for him personally, and while he was not particularly concerned about spending Celestial Crystals, he didn't want to waste them, either.</span></p><div class="pagination">
