  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The wilder they are, the more it excites me!" Fabian declared, his grin broadening as he surveyed the three Human Community female slaves on stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill swept through the crowd at his words, and sympathy flickered in their eyes as they regarded the women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe Fabian has his eye on them? Our chances are gone. How long do you think those women will last? They're just weak humans, and even if they're Celestial Deity level, they won't survive long under him. Maybe he just needs one night to break them completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! So that's why he bothered to show up at an auction like this. I thought it was odd before, but now it makes sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's clearly here for those three Celestial Deity female slaves! I've heard he's on a collecting spree for beauties from all races, specifically those at the Celestial Deity level or above. This guy's a madman&mdash;gets distracted by pretty faces and will stop at nothing to have them. We should just bow out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No contesting against him. He's a Deity Overlord warrior and the head of a respectable clan. He's loaded compared to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let it go. Those Human Community women will be a handful to train, even if one of us ended up with them. We'd just be inviting a hassle, so why bother risking it? No need to provoke Fabian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? He may be just another Deity Overlord, but he's still one of them. If we anger him, we'll be in hot water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, only someone like Fabian has a shot at taming those Celestial Deity human slaves! Nobody else here stands a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their murmurs filled the air, and not a single soul dared to bid against Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smirk at their cowardice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Fabian turned his gaze toward Osborne, the power of a Deity Overlord subtly swirling around him, his eyes gleaming with a mix of mockery and menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, is it? I remember you from previous auctions. You were the one who scooped up seven batches of Human Community slaves without resistance from me. But I advise you not to interfere in this particular bid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you might find yourself regretting it, especially since you've been cast out by the Swift family. Even if you weren't disowned and were still their golden boy, I assure you, I can take you down without breaking a sweat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandfather, Walter? He wouldn't stand a chance at stopping me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, whatever you may have uncovered, whether it's a treasure hoard of ancient deities or a stockpile of Essence Crystals, just keep your distance and let me have these women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's words dripped with threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the oppressive force of Fabian's divine power, an unmistakable miasma that announced his status as a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a Deity Overlord, alright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only other one he'd encountered was Walter, the esteemed head of the Swift family, Lachlan's grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Fabian didn't seem as formidable as Walter&mdash;evidently a recent breakthrough into Deity Overlord and a bit of a rough transition&mdash;he was still a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne knew he couldn't compete. Even if he laid all his cards on the table, it'd be useless against that level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scoff, Osborne thought to himself, "This Fabian thinks he can threaten me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wants me to bow out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not be able to take a Deity Overlord in a fight, but they won't get off easy trying to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Worst-case scenario, I'll make a run for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out loud, he coolly replied, "This is an auction. Here, I have the right to bid freely! If you have deeper pockets, then go ahead and take them home. But if you want to bully me into backing out with threats, you've picked the wrong guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not one to be easily intimidated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne raised his bidding paddle high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million!" Osborne's voice rang out, cutting through the murmurs like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction hall erupted in chaos. Gasps of disbelief echoed around the room as all eyes turned to Osborne, wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, a Deity Overlord warrior, had just issued a stark warning, advising Osborne to back off and not to contest him. Yet here stood Osborne, not only ignoring the threat but brazenly countering it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e </span><span>did </span><span>not back down, </span><span>and even</span><span> upped the ante, slapping an additional nine million onto Fabian's bid, pushing the total to 30 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd collectively held their breath, a mix of awe and dread swirling in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has this guy lost his mind?" someone whispered, watching the unfolding drama with intrigued eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who in their right mind would talk to Fabian like that? That temper of his? Oh man, this guy is toast! Once they're out of this auction, Fabian is definitely going to make him regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, no one can save this idiot now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all regarded Osborne with a mix of pity and amusement, but he remained unfazed, locking eyes with Fabian across the crowded room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Fabian's expression darkened, his eyes smoldering with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected "Lachlan," a mere Transcendent Deity level human cast out by the Swift family, to speak to him, a Deity Overlord, this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization sunk in, a tide of fury coursed through Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blatant defiance felt like a slap to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Fabian did nothing, if word got out, his reputation would take a major hit. Being brushed off in front of everyone was not an option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned downright predatory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You worthless Human Community brat, you really want to dance with death? Fine, I'll oblige. I'll turn you into nothing but a puddle of paste with a single strike!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
