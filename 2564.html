  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Drum suddenly resisted fiercely. "Mother, please save my dad. I don't want a new dad, I only recognize this one. If my dad dies, then I will also..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!" Empress Kira said to Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her stern and fierce demeanor instantly frightened Drum. Tears filled Drum's six eyes, as this was the first time her mother had scolded her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, her tears fell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Empress Kira immediately felt a bit regretful and gently said, "Drum, it's not that I don't want to save him, but it's just not worth it. You know my current situation. If I were at my peak strength, I could save him easily, even with just a thought."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, if I save him, I might fall into a deep sleep. How would I protect you then? In that case, it would take me even longer to regain my strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Drum's tears fell even faster. "Mother, please save my father. He did this because of his mother."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After listening, Empress Kira frowned and said, "He truly is very filial. So he did this because his mother's tomb was leveled, and her remains were dug up. No wonder he has such a strong obsession."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum said, "Mother, if I were in such a situation, I would do the same as Father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira felt a bit speechless. "Are you cursing me to die? Rest assured, even if the cosmos explodes, or even if everyone in the cosmos dies, I won't die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if I die, no one would dare to destroy my tomb, let alone my remains. Those people dared to do that to them because they were too weak."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Empress Kira exuded immense confidence. "Fine. Since you insist so much, and he did this out of filial piety to his mother, I will save him this time. But I will only save him once. If he is this foolish again, I will immediately take you away and never pay him any attention."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Drum was instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She held Empress Kira's arm, happily shaking it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Empress Kira was carefully assessing Osborne's condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Your obsession is too strong. Your body is on the verge of collapse, yet you still haven't given up. You truly are a filial person. For the sake of setting a good example for Drum, I will save you this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After this, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll fall into a period of slumber. You&rsquo;d better treat Drum well. Otherwise, when I wake up, you&rsquo;re done for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Empress Kira flew to the war drum and gently tapped it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a heart-shaking drumbeat sounded. The sound waves, like ripples on water, slowly spread out from the drum's surface. The waves carried an extraordinary power. Wherever the sound waves passed, Osborne's shattered body quickly healed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, under the cleansing of the sound waves, his heart, organs, body, Soul Current Ocean, and even his Satan's Eye were completely restored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Primordial on Osborne's shoulder stunned. "Her methods are truly powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empress Kira truly deserves to be the strongest Sovereign Master who once ruled the cosmos. Her methods are terrifying. A single drumbeat not only healed all of Osborne's injuries but also made his body stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No wonder so many Primordial Creatures were no match for Empress Kira and could only accept her rule. Her methods are truly terrifying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial was extremely excited because, under the influence of that drumbeat, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean also calmed down. The cracked barriers of the Soul Current Ocean quickly recovered as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those Primordial Marks seemed to become stronger and more agile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He even became better because of this?" Primordial felt a bit envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a cold female voice echoed in his ears. "Are you a World Tree offshoot? You're so weak. I once saw a World Tree offshoot who had already reached the Sovereign Level. Even I couldn't defeat him easily. Compared to him, you're as feeble as an ant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Primordial's mouth opened wide, feeling his body frozen. "Are you talking about the No. 1 World Tree offshoot? Have you seen him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Empress Kira said calmly. "Although he's just a World Tree offshoot, he has already carved out his own path. While he isn't as strong as the innate World Tree, his power is not far behind. If he could devour all of you World Tree offshoots, he might even surpass the innate World Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Primordial's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he said defiantly, "The No. 1 World Tree offshoot was just born earlier than me. I'll definitely become stronger than him in the future. Does he want to devour me? He's dreaming. I'll be the one to devour him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira sneered and said, "You should be grateful that the No. 1 World Tree offshoot can't leave the center of the cosmos. Otherwise, you would have been devoured by him the moment you were born."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want to surpass him and then devour him? Stop dreaming. Either you keep hiding at the edge of the cosmos, or you'll end up being devoured by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial, unconvinced, wanted to say more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Empress Kira ignored him and said calmly, "By comparison, that Warfare Ancient Tree has even more potential. But both of you occupying the Soul Current Ocean chosen by my daughter for her father is a bit too much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial instantly panicked. "What are you trying to do? Our fusion with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean benefits both sides."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira said disdainfully, "It indeed benefits you. But it doesn't do much for him. On the contrary, because of you... forget it. I don't want to meddle in your affairs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His Soul Current Ocean is somewhat special and shouldn't be occupied by you two. Also, his eye is quite unique, making me feel it's familiar, but I can't recall where I've seen it before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, I'll help him a bit more. From now on, this Soul Current Ocean will have that eye at its center. You both must stay on the edges."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Empress Kira waved her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Primordial found his essence forcibly moved from the center of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean to its edge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was very dissatisfied with this. However, after sensing Empress Kira's aura, he didn't dare say anything because he couldn't defeat her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he dared to express dissatisfaction, Empress Kira might directly throw him out of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. By then, he wouldn't find such a good place to grow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial could only remain silently aggrieved, while the Warfare Ancient Tree was also moved to the edge of the Soul Current Ocean by Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Empress Kira waved her hand again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, a phantom was pulled out of Osborne's Satan's Eye by her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a black-and-white eyeball, Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phantom of Satan's Eye appeared in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean and then sank into the dense soul power at the very center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira said, "Alright. I have linked his Satan's Eye with his soul power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, his Satan's Eye will improve as his soul power increases, while better utilizing his powerful soul power to perform Soul Attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Empress Kira yawned. "I need to go back to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Empress Kira disappeared, and the Drum of Empress Kira gradually became transparent in Osborne's heart before vanishing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
