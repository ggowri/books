  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze fell upon the pile of shattered statues. To his surprise, he spotted what </span><span>looked like a staff among the debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa noticed it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in shock when she recognized the staff. "The Fate Staff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Fate Staff?" Osborne </span><span>echoed,</span><span> his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his ocular energy, a rod approximately a foot long floated up from the fragments. It had a rustic, ancient appearance, half black and half white as if it had been forged by time itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the top, an intricate figure of a winged deity stood&mdash;its features were gone, yet Osborne felt an unmistakable resemblance to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, do you know this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded vigorously. "In my sudden influx of memories, there is some information about it, but it's sparse. All I know is that it's called the Fate Staff, a divine artifact said to have once belonged to the God of Destiny. Beyond that, I'm in the dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifacts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes went wide. Those were rarer and far more powerful than ancient magic weapons, crafted by no ordinary being&mdash;shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some whispered that divine artifacts were formed from the very essence of the earth, while others claimed they were remnants of long-lost deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was for sure. Divine artifacts were immensely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, Osborne had only heard of one&mdash;Cain's Blood Cross. Legend had it that Cain was the progenitor of Vampires, heralded as the God of Darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross was his weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one Osborne possessed, now inked as a tattoo on his chest, was perhaps a divine artifact in its own right, but he wasn't certain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here lay the Fate Staff&mdash;an authentic divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A greedy desire welled up inside him; who wouldn't want to possess something so powerful? But Osborne reigned in his ambition, channeling his ocular energy to present the Fate Staff to Clarissa instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take it. It feels like it belongs in your hands. Only you can truly unlock its potential."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're giving this to me? It's a divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression softened. "I believe it suits you better. You're the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family, after all. Perhaps this is its rightful place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed, Clarissa felt emotions swell within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The statues had been Osborne's conquest, and he was the one who discovered the Fate Staff. Everything rightfully belonged to him. If he wanted it, she would have no objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was an undeniable attraction pulling her toward the staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her feelings, she would never have dared to ask for it, fully aware of the value of divine artifacts&mdash;especially one as significant as the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Osborne, willingly offering it to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in her eyes as gratitude washed over her. Unable to contain herself, </span><span>Clarissa stepped closer and enveloped him in a heartfelt embrace, the kind that spoke volumes of her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rose up on her toes, leaning in to place a sweet kiss on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard but pleasantly surprised, Osborne responded, their lips entwining as his tongue danced with hers, sending blushes blooming on Clarissa's cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't pull away; instead, she melted into the kiss, eyes fluttering shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, they finally parted, strands of shimmering saliva threading between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her cheeks still flushed, Clarissa lowered her gaze, unable to meet Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we should let everyone know about us. I don't want to hide anymore. I want to shout from the rooftops that I like you&mdash;I want the world to know I'm your girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up, her eyes shimmering with hope, but Osborne stood frozen in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Announcing their relationship to everyone was a topic Osborne had been mulling over himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth trial from the Godfather required him to pursue Clarissa and make her his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the specifics of what constituted "completion" were quite vague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, Clarissa was already his girlfriend&mdash;he had won her heart. Yet, the fourth trial seemed far from complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even wondered if the trial was only considered finished after they had consummated their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly dismissed this notion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reasoned that the reason his trial wasn't completed was that their relationship had not been publicly declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To truly finish the task, Osborne needed to make their relationship known to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a dilemma, unsure of how to proceed, when Clarissa took the initiative to suggest announcing their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, have you thought this through? Announcing our relationship will bring a lot of pressure. You know as well as I do that your family won't exactly be thrilled about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, determination in her eyes. "Osborne, I've made up my mind. I don't care what others think or say. I want to be with you, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should announce it! I'm ready to face whatever comes our way. In the past, I didn't have the strength to support you, so I hesitated to push for a public declaration. But now, I'm capable of standing on my own. I can share the burden with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> let's go ahead and make it official!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
