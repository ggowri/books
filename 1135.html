  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Godfather!" Matthew responded quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to explain the situation regarding the Draco Group's energy guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weapons had been in production for quite some time, but only in </span><span>small</span><span> quantities. Most of them were </span><span>used</span><span> on the Draco Group's combat drones and robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While their power was decent and stronger</span><span>, but not much,</span><span> than standard kinetic weapons</span><span>. T</span><span>hey were still only capable of inflicting damage on Class B metahumans at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to their high production costs, few factions could afford to splurge on energy guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most believed it was more practical to invest in a larger stock of kinetic weapons and equip more personnel, achieving a similar effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, </span><span>energy guns</span><span> </span><span>became a hit </span><span>three months ago when the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> launched an attack on the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members, armed with modified energy guns, wreaked havoc, turning the tide of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to breakthroughs in materials, their power had increased dramatically; even Class A warriors found it hard to withstand their fire. In a coordinated attack, they could take down Class AA and even Class AAA opponents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The super energy guns posed an even greater threat, capable of challenging Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Word spread fast, and suddenly, energy guns were the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, when cities faced Beast Tide attacks and sought help from the Augustine family, the Draco Armed Services Branch was dispatched with energy guns </span><span>to help</span><span>. Their effectiveness against the Beast Tide was unparalleled, far surpassing that of ordinary kinetic weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>V</span><span>arious factions began to take notice and were eager to purchase energy guns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had yet to decide whether to sell these weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was concerned that if these factions became too powerful, they might one day turn their weapons against the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Matthew finished his explanation, Osborne fell deep into thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he declared, "Energy guns can be sold, but we need to keep the price </span><span>reasonable. </span><span>Also, they are not only available</span><span> to the Ancient Families and superpowers. Even ordinary folks </span><span>can have access to </span><span>energy guns</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, you want to sell energy guns to regular people? Aren't you worried about the chaos </span><span>that could cause? Handing weapons to civilians is like giving a baby a loaded gun. There are bound to be unpredictable risks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head</span><span> seriously</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, </span><span>the world</span><span> has changed</span><span>, so has t</span><span>he times</span><span>; the entire Blue Planet is in turmoil. The Beast Tide threatens human cities and everyone's safety. Some even say the </span><span>doom day</span><span> is </span><span>coming</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still worried about the risks of giving ordinary people energy guns? They need to defend themselves! They </span><span>need</span><span> weapons to protect their homes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the energy guns we sell can be customized. We can build in </span><span>hidden functions</span><span> for remote control, allowing us to limit their firepower whenever necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they misuse the guns to create chaos or harm others, we can instantly disable </span><span>the guns</span><span>, turning </span><span>them</span><span> into useless scrap metal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And when they face a Beast Tide attack, we can help them unlock higher power levels to better fend off the beasts and safeguard their communities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't just feasible; it's our responsibility! </span><span>H</span><span>idden functions</span><span>. Not difficult, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's eyes lit up immediately at Osborne's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That should be no problem! Leaving a </span><span>hidden function</span><span> </span><span>in </span><span>the energy guns </span><span>will ensure they won't turn </span><span>guns </span><span>on us someday. Since you've made the call, Godfather, we'll </span><span>follow</span><span> this plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Just remember, the super energy guns are off the table. We don't have enough for ourselves as it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" Matthew affirmed, though </span><span>he later frowned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we </span><span>start the</span><span> energy gun sales, we're going to be swamped with orders. With those sales alone, the Draco Group could solidify its position as the top conglomerate in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But mass</span><span>-</span><span>producing</span><span> </span><span>energy guns</span><span> requires rare metals, and we'll need to send more people to the rare metal mines. </span><span>And </span><span>those mines are out in the wilderness, and most of them are now </span><span>controlled</span><span> by beasts..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne's eyes flashed with cold determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll take them back! I'll have the Blood Demon squad assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew </span><span>relaxe</span><span>d</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Blood Demons backing us, it'll be a piece of cake. They're our anchor in these turbulent times. But while you were</span><span> in slumber</span><span>, no one could command the Blood Demon, not even the former Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demons answered only to him; they were under his control and his alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Matthew left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally relaxed, </span><span>Osborne glanced down at his sister Anastasia, who still clung tightly to his arm, and couldn't help but grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's good to have my family safe and together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But where is Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been awake for quite some time now, yet Clarissa hadn't shown up. A growing sense of worry began to </span><span>rise</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>e </span><span>immediately </span><span>dialed Clarissa's number.</span></p><div class="pagination">
