  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The few security personnel immediately sprang into action at the command. With expressions as sharp as blades, they swiftly restrained Justin and Penelope, gripping their arms and dragging them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family members watched in terror, not daring to utter a word. Even the bodyguards Justin had brought along could only stand by, too frightened to intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Get your hands off me! What&rsquo;s wrong with me reporting him? Why are you throwing me out? He&rsquo;s a worthless commoner, pretending to be a VIP.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin struggled angrily, but his resistance only earned him a heavy slap that left his face swollen. He was stunned and no longer dared to struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t long before the security personnel tossed him and Penelope out, and they ended up sprawled on the ground in an undignified manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne watched with a sneer and couldn&rsquo;t help but reflect, &ldquo;So, is this what power feels like? It sure is exhilarating.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had long been fed up with Justin but never found the right opportunity to deal with him. After all, Justin was the Caldwell family&rsquo;s eldest heir, while Osborne was simply a husband who had joined through marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, it was always Justin who bullied Osborne. But now, with a single command from Osborne, someone would punish Justin for him. That was the power of authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as of now, Osborne only had a one-star rank within the Draco Group. As his rank increased to two stars, three stars, and even six or seven stars and beyond, his power would become even more terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that point, a single word from Osborne could determine the fate of a top-tier family or even an established lineage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By then, he would wield absolute power and enjoy all the pleasures of life, practically living out every man&rsquo;s ultimate fantasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After three years of living as a dependent in the Caldwell family, Osborne had had enough of his humble existence. He no longer wanted to suffer insults or contempt. Therefore, he sought power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He firmly thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">I must pass the Godfather&rsquo;s successor test and become the true successor</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">m</span><span style="font-style: italic;">aybe even the new Godfather</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Lewis, we have a blacklist system, right?&rdquo; Osborne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe instantly understood his meaning and respectfully replied, &ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then turned to Justin and commanded, &ldquo;Put them all on the blacklist. From now on, they&rsquo;re banned from entering the Draco Auction House and all of the Draco Group&rsquo;s premises.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Debbe finished speaking, Ophelia stared with wide eyes, her face full of astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Draco Group was a colossal conglomerate in Rosmandi, dominating nearly every industry. People in Rosmandi often said that three things in their lives were unavoidable: death, guns, and the Draco Group. Although this might seem exaggerated, it demonstrated the immense influence of the Draco Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin and Penelope were blacklisted by the Draco Group, barring them from entering any of its properties. This even disrupted their daily lives. If this implicated the Caldwell family, it would spell disaster for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked terrified, fearing that she might also be blacklisted, and quickly stepped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She still doubted Osborne&rsquo;s status as a VIP, as she was sure that he had somehow deceived Debbe. Even so, they no longer dared to speak up, fearing they would end up like Justin and Penelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin and Penelope were dumbfounded. Especially Justin, who had always hoped to replace Ophelia as the Caldwell family&rsquo;s successor. However, now that the Draco Group had blacklisted him, all those dreams were shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Wise Order of the Caldwell family would never allow someone who had offended the Draco Group to become the successor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Justin&rsquo;s expression was one of pure rage and madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why would this happen? I was just trying to help the Draco Auction House by exposing Osborne as a fake VIP. Why did Debbe not only fail to appreciate my efforts but also blacklist me and throw me out?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was resentful and furious. He didn&rsquo;t dare to hate the Draco Group or Debbe. He believed it was all Osborne&rsquo;s fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew for sure that Osborne was the one who had caused his downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin then glared at Osborne and exclaimed inwardly, &ldquo;This worthless scum has to die. No matter what it takes, I have to kill scum. I must reach out to The Aberrants and get Milo involved. Osborne must die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s mind was a storm of anger as he gritted his teeth and stared at Osborne. Without uttering any harsh words, he quickly lowered his head and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Those who talk don&rsquo;t act, and those who act don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Osborne murmured. As he sensed Justin&rsquo;s murderous intent, his expression hardened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had truly angered Justin this time. But Osborne didn&rsquo;t care, as he was no longer the same person he used to be. If Justin still saw Osborne as the former useless man, Justin would be in for a very harsh reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t bother with Ophelia and the others anymore and walked in through the VIP lane, accompanied by the enthusiastic Debbe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked grim, but she didn&rsquo;t dare to stop them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, the others around them speculated about Osborne&rsquo;s background, thinking about how they could approach and connect with him later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regardless of his background, as long as his identity as a VIP of the Draco Group was authentic, it was enough for these elite families to humble themselves to associate with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn bastard,&rdquo; Ophelia muttered through gritted teeth. &ldquo;A fake is still a fake. Even if Osborne can fool everyone for a while, he won&rsquo;t be able to fool them forever. When his true identity is exposed, he will be the one to suffer. He&rsquo;s just a worthless piece of trash.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
