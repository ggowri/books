  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Upon hearing this, Osborne turned to look at Clarissa. Seeing that she was still holding the Fate Staff, he couldn&#x27;t help but sneer at Evelynn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;So, she wants the Fate Staff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Fate Staff is a divine artifact, and it is very likely the weapon once used by the Goddess of Fate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No wonder Evelynn is tempted.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">If the person holding the Fate Staff was not Clarissa but someone else, Osborne would also be tempted and want to snatch it away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, it was a divine artifact!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Up to now, Osborne had seen two and a half real divine artifacts.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The first was the Trident of Poseidon in Bryce&#x27;s hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The second was the Fate Staff in Clarissa&#x27;s hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As for the other half, it was the Blood Cross that had merged with his body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Blood Cross was most likely Cain&#x27;s weapon.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, the Blood Cross had not yet demonstrated any mighty power. At least, it was far inferior to Bryce&#x27;s Trident of Poseidon and Clarissa&#x27;s Fate Staff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So, until now, Osborne was not sure whether his Blood Cross was the legendary divine artifact. It could only be considered half of it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">How precious were divine artifacts?</p><p style="text-align:left;">How could Evelynn take it away so easily?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sneered, &quot;How can you say such shameless words? Don&#x27;t you know what shame is?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn&#x27;s expression became even colder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It seems that you are not ready to hand over the staff!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne snorted, &quot;I want your head. Do you want to give it to me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing his words, Evelynn became extremely angry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But even more angry were the three young men behind her. They all shouted angrily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You bastard!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re courting death!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How dare you talk to her that way?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you know who she is?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;She asked you to hand over the staff. It&#x27;s an honor for you. How dare you humiliate her?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re doomed!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The three men were furious, which surprised Osborne a bit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne stared at the three and said calmly, &quot;I don&#x27;t know who she is. How about you introduce her to me?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The three heard that and immediately looked proud.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn also raised her chin slightly, revealing a proud look.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Listen carefully, bumpkin.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A young man shouted, &quot;She is Evelynn Augustine, a direct descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City. She is 23 years old and has already become a Class A Power Master. She is the third-ranked super genius in our 30th Power Prodigy Class!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And her elder brother is Owen Augustine!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you know who Owen is, bumpkin? I guess you have never heard of him. Let me tell you. Owen is one of the most outstanding young men in the Augustine family in Newport City and one of the most likely to become the heir of the Augustine family!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You should be afraid!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The young man&#x27;s face was full of contempt. &quot;Your last name is also Augustine, but the difference between you and Evelynn is like the clouds in the sky and the mud on the ground!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Give that staff to Evelynn right now!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing the young man&#x27;s words, Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at Evelynn carefully for the first time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne thought, &quot;She is actually a direct descendant of the Augustine family in Newport City. Isn&#x27;t the Augustine family in Newport City Godfather&#x27;s family?</p><p style="text-align:left;">In other words, is Evelynn actually related to me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">A twenty-three-year-old Class A Power Master?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Is her brother Owen?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s eyes were a little solemn. He knew Owen. Serena had told him that the Augustine family in Newport City had four most outstanding young men, namely Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma.</p><p style="text-align:left;">These four people would be his competitors in the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Owen was 31 years old and ranked fourth among the younger generation of the Augustine family. His mother was a member of another ancient family in Newport City.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had perfectly inherited the talents of his parents and possessed dual powers. When he was twenty-one years old, he had already become a Class A Power Master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne wanted to become Godfather&#x27;s successor, and Owen would sooner or later become his rival.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And was Evelynn Owen&#x27;s sister?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are you scared now?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing that Osborne hadn&#x27;t said anything, the young man thought that Osborne was afraid and said proudly, &quot;Since you are scared, hand over the staff now! You are not qualified to own such a staff!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Hand it over immediately, and we won&#x27;t make things difficult for you.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Otherwise, you will become the enemy of the Augustine family in Newport City, and you will not survive in Rosmandi!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After he finished speaking, Clarissa turned pale.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She walked to Osborne&#x27;s side and held Osborne&#x27;s hand tightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Osborne, what should we do?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;They&#x27;re from the Augustine family in Newport City, the owner of the Draco Group, the king of Rosmandi&#x27;s underground world, and Godfather&#x27;s relative. We can&#x27;t beat them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa whispered with a worried look.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn smiled, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make things difficult for you, nor do I want to use my status to pressure you. But I really like that staff, so I can only ask for it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I won&#x27;t get your staff for nothing. Give it to me, and I&#x27;ll give you two billion dollars!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;From now on, you&#x27;ll be my friends. How about that?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying that, Evelynn looked proud.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She seemed to believe that Osborne and Clarissa would definitely agree to her proposal.</p><div class="pagination">
