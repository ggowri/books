  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the living room, the upper echelons of the Augustine family and the Draco Group had gathered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson, Miranda, Fiona, Ashley, and Serena&mdash;the direct associate of Sebastian&mdash;stood alongside the elders Declan, Bob, and James, as well as the younger generation represented by Emma and Matthew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they bowed to Osborne in unison, a wave of pressure settled heavily on his shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised a hand, signaling for them to rise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, no need for formalities," Osborne said, trying to ease the tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Osborne moved over to a plush gray sofa, feeling a wave of nostalgia wash over him. He vividly remembered his first encounter with Sebastian, who had been sitting on this very sofa, cradling a cat in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's thoughts were interrupted as something caught his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the corner of the living room, there it was&mdash;a black-and-gold cat lounging on a wooden shelf, its bright eyes fixed intently on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He beckoned, and the sleek black-and-gold feline sprang to its feet, bounding over to Osborne and leaping into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Such a well-behaved little thing, aren't you?" Osborne chuckled, raising an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mimicked his grandfather's affectionate hold, sinking into the gray sofa, the soft fabric enveloping him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Wesson, Miranda, and the elders of the Augustine family froze, struck by a wave of nostalgia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They looked at Osborne and felt as if they were transported back in time, witnessing the former Godfather in all his glory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, alongside the warmth of memories, an intense aura radiated from Osborne, imposing and authoritative, making it hard for them to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a calm smile, he stroked the cat's sleek, shiny fur. "Everyone, please, have a seat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Godfather," they replied in unison, settling down, yet their demeanor was more respectful than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Wesson, Miranda, and the other two Class S powerhouses straightened up, their expressions serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of silence, Declan finally spoke up, "Godfather, according to tradition, you need to hold the inheritance ceremony. Have you thought about when..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waved a hand, cutting him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Declan Augustine, let's skip the ceremony. The Augustine family is in turmoil. The Aberrants has already declared war and will soon be at Newport City's doorstep. The League of Divine Descent's deputy leader, Rumen, fell at our hands, and they won't let that slide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this really the time to be discussing a ceremony? We should focus on surviving this crisis first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan hesitated, then nodded slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's words cast a shadow over the room, and everyone's brows furrowed with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather, are we really going to abandon all of the Draco Group's assets and retreat to Newport City?" Wesson asked, his voice laced with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded gravely. "The Aberrants is far stronger than you realize. With our current strength, even holding Newport City may not be feasible for the Augustine family. We simply don't have the resources to protect the Draco Group anymore; we have to let it go for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We need to clear out Mount Three and Mount Four of the Augustine family to make room for the Draco Armed Services Branch and Blood Demon members. For the time being, we must hold the line at all costs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The meeting dragged on for a full hour, with Osborne presiding as Godfather for the first time, orchestrating everything with surprising ease. His demeanor brought an evident sense of order, and everyone was surprisingly cooperative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once all the arrangements were made, Osborne let out a sigh of relief and waved everyone off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eventually, only Emma remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled at her, waving her over. He asked, "Emma, how's your injury? Are you feeling better now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded, walking gingerly to his side, though her face revealed a mix of emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Osborne asked, a hint of confusion in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Biting her lip, Emma replied, "Osborne, with you embodying Godfather now, I can't help but feel your presence is so powerful, it makes me hesitant to get close."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was momentarily speechless at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently took her hand and pulled her onto his lap, grinning as he said, "Silly girl, no matter what identity I take on, I'm still me. That hasn't changed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he affectionately ruffled Emma's hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, she felt a weight lift off her shoulders, wrapping her arms around his, smiling, "Just promise me you won't use Godfather's authority to intimidate me in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they shared this light-hearted moment, Osborne suddenly noticed the black-and-gold cat sitting nearby, its bright, inquisitive eyes trained on him and Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He scooped up the cat in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this Grandpa's pet? Such a well-behaved little thing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's expression shifted to one of disbelief. "Osborne, its name is Divine Shadow! It's not just any pet; it's actually older than the former Godfather! I've heard my grandpa say that when the Augustine family first settled here, Divine Shadow was already around. It's at least three hundred years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not something that everyone can just pick up, you know? Besides the former Godfather and you, no one else has ever managed to hold it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's words left Osborne utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at the black-and-gold cat, incredulous. "Three hundred years old? You must be joking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does that mean it's practically a monster?"</p><div class="pagination">
