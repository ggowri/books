  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, Osborne is not a bad person. He won't harm me, and he will do everything to protect me, and that's enough!" Clarissa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded; even though she still had some caution towards Osborne, she had to admit that he was indeed trying his best to protect Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, his status is too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A common orphan, with such strength, he is truly a rare talent! If only his status were a bit higher, even just as an heir of a prestigious family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head, thinking to herself, "Even as an heir of a prestigious family, it wouldn't do, he would be still out of Clarissa's league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna then said, "Clarissa, I must remind you, you absolutely cannot develop feelings for him because if you do, you'll only hurt yourself and him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, you are engaged to someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That person should be coming back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Donna finished speaking, Clarissa's face turned pale; she clenched her fist tightly, her eyes full of unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she only lowered her head and muttered, "I understand, Aunt Donna."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Osborne was driving with Barlyn, leaving the Radcliffe Manor behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne spotted a truck by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, let's switch vehicles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne parked his car, found a set of keys on the truck's tire, and opened the truck's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Osborne, what are we going to do? Why should we switch to a truck? You're not taking me to rob a bank, are you? Moreover, you don't need a truck to rob a bank; how much money would it take to need a truck?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First of all, I don't do anything illegal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, no longer hiding his intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not robbing a bank, but something similar. While investigating the attack on Ms. Radcliffe, I unexpectedly found out that the leader of Maelstrom, the liaison of the Aberrants, was involved in the attack on Ms. Radcliffe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He runs illegal businesses; he definitely wouldn't dare to keep his money in a bank; it must be hidden somewhere. So, I found out the location of his stash through special means; it's in the basement of the villa where he lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, since he's the leader of a gang, the money must be protected by someone. I don't have the confidence to do it alone, that's why I called you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not willing to do it, then you can get off the car, I'll go alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Barlyn was enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The liaison of the Aberrants? Involved in the attack on Clarissa? This jerk deserves to die! Of course, I'm in for this; even if there's no money to split, I'll do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, rest assured, I'll personally take that jerk down later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Then I can rest easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Davy's villa, where the money was stashed, was located near a slum in the northern part of the city, filled with a large number of thugs who were peripheral members of Maelstrom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne parked the car 1600 feet away from the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye to check the situation inside the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's a bit tricky, there are at least thirty members of Maelstrom inside the villa, and they all have guns! Once the gunfire starts, hundreds of Maelstrom members will appear from the slum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, without x-ray vision, was unaware of the situation inside the villa. Seeing Osborne stop, he immediately said, "Osborne, let's move! It's just the leader of a gang, I can take them all down myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some thought, Osborne nodded. "Let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove the truck and soon arrived near the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Halt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several members of Maelstrom stopped the truck, eyeing the two of them warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could speak, Barlyn suddenly made a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, and suddenly, several yellow energy balls appeared in front of the men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those yellow balls were as hard as a rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're here to finish you off!" Barlyn yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, those balls slammed into their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemies fell to the ground, unconscious and without a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked over at Osborne, a smug grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not too shabby, right, Osborne?" Barlyn bragged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, pulling out his handgun. "Not bad at all. Let's brace ourselves for some action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised his gun and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, several Maelstrom members, seeing their comrades suddenly knocked out, quickly drew their guns and aimed at Osborne and Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could even squeeze the trigger, Osborne was already firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Model H mini-handgun spat out bullets with blinding speed. The tiny projectiles tore through the heads of the distant Maelstrom members, leaving gaping bloodstains and sending them straight to their graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!" Osborne shouted, kicking open the car door and sprinting into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Satan's Eye active, Osborne's enhanced vision effortlessly spotted the Maelstrom members hiding around corners, ready to ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning-fast reflexes made short work of them, each one falling before they could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, despite his formidable abilities, didn't get a chance to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cleared the villa of any threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then guided Barlyn to the vault door in the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered the combination, he said, "We need to hurry. Davy's probably already gotten the word and is bringing a whole army of Maelstrom members this way. Let's grab the money and get out of here fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vault door creaked open, and both men peered inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions froze in shock as they took in the scene before them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
