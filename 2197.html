  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence declared, "There's not a soul below Empyrean Sacredness who can withstand my attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, the Sacred Dragon Clan horns I've painstakingly acquired will be forever weakened after this. They won't have their original might anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never wanted to resort to this... but your strength has caught me off guard. I have no choice but to unleash it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night... no, I should say Osborne now. It's time for you to die! I'll do my best to gather your remains, giving you a proper burial and a grand tomb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assuming there'll be anything left of you after this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that chilling declaration left his lips, Lord Malevolence wasted no time. The terrifying Sacred Power locked onto Osborne, surging forward like a volcano erupting, an unstoppable wave that threatened to engulf everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, silence fell across the battlefield&mdash;a tense, suffocating quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face, usually composed, now showed traces of panic. She desperately tried to rush toward Osborne, only to be stymied by a crushing force that held her back, immobilizing her with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa yelled frantically, "No! Osborne! Get out of the way! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was also sprinting toward Osborne, her heart pounding in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, Austin, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others felt the weight of that overwhelming Sacred Power attack, their faces etched with terror as they charged toward Osborne, hoping to shield him from the impending doom, but their efforts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic and fear painted their expressions as they screamed, "Darling, run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, get out of there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hear their cries. He wasn't ignoring their pleas; he simply understood that the moment the Sacred Power locked onto him, there was no escaping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amidst the chaos surrounding him, he remained unnervingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike them, who were in a state of frenzy, Osborne had a strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew deep down that no matter how fearsome Lord Malevolence's attack was, it couldn't kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had at least two methods to defuse the crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first was to call upon the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. It was a Sacred Artifact, and even though it had suffered considerable damage and most of its defense runes were destroyed, it could still effortlessly absorb Lord Malevolence's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he took refuge within the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he would emerge unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second option was to shift into his second form&mdash;the crimson lotus&mdash;activating his absolute defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that defense in place, not even a true Empyrean Sacredness warrior could penetrate it, let alone an attack derived from the fusion of two dragon horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, as Osborne surveyed Lord Malevolence, a smirk creeping up his face, he spoke coolly, "You're a bit overconfident there, Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking you can kill me with this? You're in for a disappointment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your trump card is impressive, but against me, it falls short!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence scoffed at Osborne's bravado, his voice laced with contempt. "Oh really? Let's put that to the test! I can't believe you think a mere Ascension Six Supernal Deity King can withstand my Sacred Power attack! As I said, no one can endure what's coming next below the Empyrean Sacredness level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that ultimatum hanging in the air, Lord Malevolence unleashed his Sacred Power attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ear-splitting roar of the Sacred Power erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was capable of shattering a small planet, and it now converged on Osborne, delivering a force that was nothing short of cataclysmic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne was struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Sacred Power defenses shattered like glass, and he was sent hurtling through the air, crashing down into the earth below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to freeze as Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others stood frozen in horror, their faces drained of color as they beheld the spot where Osborne had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes on the battlefield turned to that deadly impact point, knowing full well that the outcome of Lord Malevolence's devastating blow would determine the fate of all Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne fell at the hands of Lord Malevolence, Celestara Planet would become his playground, a realm poised for conquest under his brutal rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would reign supreme, able to slaughter the Human Community at will, enslaving them without resistance, and soon enough, he would resurrect the Malevolence Empire without a single soul to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The age of Lord Malevolence was just around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Osborne managed to withstand this onslaught, it would spell the end for Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, having unleashed all his hidden trump cards, he would be powerless to defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would rise, and with him, Celestara Planet would flourish under his leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence would either meet his demise or be forced to flee into the void, forever roaming the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion poured their bitter curses on Osborne, each soldier praying fervently for Lord Malevolence to rid them of the final obstacle&mdash;the annoying </span><span>member from the </span><span>Human Community that kept them from achieving true dominion over Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the members of the Human Alliance were fervently hoping and praying for Osborne, pleading for him to withstand Lord Malevolence's titanic assault, to emerge unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Osborne was their champion, the beacon of hope for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he fell, they would face nothing but a future filled with slaughter by the Dark Deity Legion or enslavement at the hands of the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, tens of billions of eyes were glued to the battlefield, holding their breath as they awaited the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hellish attack from Lord Malevolence crashed into Osborne, slamming him into the earth, and continued to unleash its unstoppable fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground beneath him melted away as though ice were met with flame, creating a massive pit that stretched for miles in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This chasm was so deep it felt like it could pierce the very heart of Celestara Planet itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire planet trembled violently, volcanoes roared to life, and the ground fissured, sending waves of panic flooding through everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They feared that the entire world might shatter into oblivion at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, that catastrophic event did not come to pass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, the overwhelming assault gradually subsided, losing its strength until it finally vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battlefield fell eerily silent, the vast chasm remained, a haunting reminder of the ferocity of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence stood at the edge of the gaping hole, his face pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd poured everything into that attack, drawing on the power of the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn and the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn, and the toll it took on him was staggering. He wouldn't be able to repeat it again anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two dragon horns atop his head appeared dim and worn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To any astute observer, tiny cracks had started to form across their surface, power leaking away like sand through fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That last strike had nearly shattered the horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lord Malevolence felt no regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept onto his face as he peered into the depths of the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such a terrifying strike, surely he must have perished. He couldn't possibly have survived... could he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a flicker of desperation crept into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Lord Malevolence leaned closer to examine the pit, something caught his eye, freezing him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of the enormous pit, Osborne was nowhere to be seen, but instead, a magnificent blood-red lotus stood defiantly at the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What sent a shockwave of recognition through him was the energy signature radiating from that flower&mdash;it unmistakably belonged to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Lord Malevolence was taken aback, completely nonplussed by this sight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
