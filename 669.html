  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly topped the points scoreboard, making his five rivals feel the pressure and begin taking new actions to increase their points quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had already left </span><span>Dampston</span><span> with Clarissa and arrived in </span><span>Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the war had just begun, Osborne ordered everyone to retreat to Campbell and let the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> take control of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, ensuring the strength of his team remained intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even found themselves bored at the headquarters in Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Elder Janet of the Augustine family found their daily amusement in observing the people at Training Base No. 6 as doing various training sessions at the headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, what do you think of these people?" Janet asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb said solemnly, "Although these people refuse to reveal their identities, I know that they are the Godfather's secret armed forces! I never expected them to appear here and become Osborne's men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet raised an eyebrow and asked, "Are you suspecting something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, Caleb replied, "Don't you have any suspicions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even we, elders of the Augustine family, cannot come into contact with the Godfather's secret armed forces, let alone command them. Neither could those outstanding young people like Vincent, Matthew, and Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it that Osborne, a branch bloodline member, can command them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, who is Osborne exactly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet glared at him and said, "If you have something to say, just say it directly. Don't ask me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb smiled and suggested, "Why don't we exchange our speculations? Let's see if our guesses are the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, Janet nodded, "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they both spoke at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think Osborne is from the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. He has a deeper connection with the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their sentences, they exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that we are on the same page."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Caleb continued, "On the surface, Osborne is the son of Allen, the former head of the branch in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, and the grandson of Elder Isaac. But after observing and investigating for some time, I am almost certain that Isaac is not Osborne's biological grandfather! In fact, Osborne isn't even from the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The identity of Osborne as the heir of the branch bloodline in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is just a disguise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But his Satan's Eye can't be faked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, he is definitely a member of our Augustine family, perhaps even from the main bloodline. It is even possible that he has a direct blood relationship with the Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Janet changed her expression immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that Osborne might be the Godfather's biological grandson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded. "Do you remember Theodore, the Godfather's only son? Over twenty years ago, Theodore and his wife Vivienne disappeared together. The Godfather </span><span>searched for them for over twenty years and never gave up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on Theodore's age, if he had children with Vivienne, their child would be around Osborne's age."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Caleb's face became grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet looked puzzled. "So, Osborne could be Theodore and Vivienne's child, the Godfather's biological grandson? The Godfather's sole heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet gasped, "Should we inform the other elders about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shook his head. "No need! Let's pretend we don't know it. The Godfather must have his reasons for not disclosing Osborne's true identity. If we reveal it, we might disrupt the Godfather's plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, Osborne is still a bit too young. If he were a few years older, perhaps he could really compete with Vincent and Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, it will be difficult!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sighing, Caleb suddenly heard someone rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Caleb Augustine, something has happened!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's points suddenly skyrocketed by five thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has topped the points scoreboard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Caleb and Janet stood up, wearing shocked expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was especially embarrassed to hear the news. He had just mentioned how Osborne was too young to compete with Vincent and Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, right after saying that, Osborne's points suddenly increased by five thousand, pushing him to the top of the scoreboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb quickly checked the scoreboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne dominate the scoreboard with three thousand points, he took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did he do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This kid stayed alone in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> without telling us the reason. Previously, it was shocking enough when he obtained one thousand points from ambushing two rare metal mining areas. And now, he has gained five thousand points?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that he killed five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb glanced at Janet, looking perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet glared at him. "What are you looking at me for? Contact Osborne and ask him what's going on! We have reached the top, and regardless of how Osborne achieved it, it's good news for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded and began to contact Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
