  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne finished absorbing the blood energy from the battlefield, a thunderous roar shattered the air, filled with boundless rage and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped around to locate the source of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Deities had arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three enormous, grotesque beasts charged toward him from the distance. They were repulsive, resembling giant cockroaches with pitch-black bodies and wings that could fold like blades. Long, whip-like tentacles sprouted from their heads, while beneath them, six tentacle-like appendages writhed like those of an octopus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, these were colossal versions of Dark Exotic Beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three creatures were ten times the size of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, radiating an overwhelming aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced up at them, assessing the Divine Flames flickering above their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One Superior Deity and two Intermediate Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled sharply, a chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Beast Tide is no ordinary threat. Behind it, three Dark Deities are pulling the </span><span>strings&mdash;one Superior Deity and two Intermediate Deities. Even with the Blood Demon members at my command, stopping this onslaught will be a monumental challenge. The casualties could be catastrophic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts raced as he felt a deep sense of inadequacy wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months had passed since the world had changed, and with the abundant energy flooding the realm, those Dark Deities who had survived since the Age of Gods were beginning to regain their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Superior Deities were already emerging in numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that as more gods awakened&mdash;whether they be human or Dark Deities&mdash;their power would only grow, and their ranks would swell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of encountering Transcendent Deity warriors, beings even more powerful than Superior Deities, loomed ominously on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne felt he could still hold his ground against a Superior Deity, even if he couldn't win, he was confident he could make them pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a Transcendent Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was far beyond what Osborne could handle at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to boost my power, and fast! But breaking through from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity isn't a walk in the park; it requires an immense amount of energy. Even with the energy in the Augustine Bastion being a hundred times richer than outside, it's going to take time! I need a faster solution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne resolved then and there that once he returned, he would enter seclusion, determined to elevate his rank from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity in the shortest time possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he needed to complete the third phase of his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would he have a fighting chance to protect himself, along with his loved ones, in this increasingly dangerous world where gods were awakening left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a spark of inspiration lit up in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is composed of energy, and it's a high-level energy at that. To break through, I need vast amounts of energy, and relying solely on my own absorption will take ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if I can siphon energy directly from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Breath of Celestial can extract core energy from it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the core energy is vital to the Lotus' essence and can't be drawn upon indefinitely, what about the regular energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even that ordinary energy is far superior to divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll give it a shot when I get back! With the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I might just be able to make that breakthrough in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization settled in, Osborne turned his gaze towards the three enraged Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been orchestrating the Beast Tide from the shadows, presumably believing that an army of over 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts would be enough to </span><span>obliterate Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when faced with the shocking news that over three thousand of their monstrous allies had already been taken down, their rage erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They decided to step onto the battlefield themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they joined the fray, their destructive power was evident. A single attack from one of them reduced a corner of Hearin City to mere rubble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, most of the ordinary citizens had already fled deeper into the city. Otherwise, this catastrophic blow could have easily claimed the lives of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as the people of Hearin City gazed upon the terrifying trio of Dark Deities, who could effortlessly devastate half their city, fear and despair etched their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run for your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out! Those are god-level Dark Exotic Beasts; we don't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't leave now, we'll all be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, terror gripped everyone; the courage to confront the Beast Tide evaporated. They scrambled toward the city's innermost parts, hoping to escape via the coastal route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could the Dark Deities possibly let them slip away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar, the three beasts unleashed chaos upon everything that stood in their path, determined to destroy all obstacles like a force of nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin City hung in the balance, teetering on the edge of devastation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this madness continued, Hearin City would soon meet the same fate as Yalynch's Lafier City, Marcelin's Harbino City, Ransford's Denferes City, and Easionand's Mayano City&mdash;all reduced to smoldering ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone within would perish, leaving behind nothing but a city of the dead!</span></p><div class="pagination">
