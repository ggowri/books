  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You deserve to die!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert roared, seething with rage. How could he have been made to cough up blood on stage?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The injury itself wasn't much, but the rapid loss of life force was devastating. He felt his body becoming heavy and fatigued, no longer at its peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a fatal blow to his&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His goal was to achieve 80, 90, or even 100 consecutive wins. He wanted to become the first in&nbsp;Tethynia&nbsp;and the tenth in the world to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted his&nbsp;Honor Quest&nbsp;Ceremony to shine, for his name to be remembered by all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For that, he needed to battle through 100 matches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In such grueling bouts, managing energy consumption was key, using as little force as possible to defeat opponents without wearing himself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma&nbsp;was the 30th challenger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Up until then, Cuthbert had been confident. He had barely used any energy to achieve his 29 victories, and was still at his peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His confidence had soared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as he kept this up, he believed he had a real chance at 100 consecutive wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that's when Emma showed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't take her seriously and was already prepared to give her the same brutal beating he had given Rhett. He was ready to teach her a harsh lesson and leave her gravely injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he had miscalculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;was strange and terrifying. Not only did it continuously drain his life force, but it also withstood his powerful attacks, forcing him to use even more energy to break through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;was about to shatter, Emma's ultimate move suddenly drained a huge amount of his life force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The massive loss of life force left him exhausted, no longer at his peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Cuthbert not be furious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt weak. In this state, how could he even think about 100 consecutive wins? Forget 100, 90, or even 80 wins seemed impossible now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You ruined my plan! You ruined my&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony! I'll kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert roared in anger, his killing intent boiling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strength Realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert finally unleashed his&nbsp;Strength Realm, and the terrifying wave of energy blasted through the stage. It instantly shattered Emma's already crumbling&nbsp;Death Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma violently spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;was closely tied to her&nbsp;Death's Stare, even though the realm was stable, its collapse caused severe psychic backlash, hitting her hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned deathly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, her goal had been achieved. She'd drained a significant amount of Cuthbert's life force and forced him to use his realm early. She had succeeded in depleting much of his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert glared at Emma, icy cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You wretched woman! You ruined my plan and cost me my chance at 100 consecutive wins. Now, you'll face my wrath."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert stormed toward Emma, step by step, his rage seething.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's lips curled in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, do you think you can go for 100 consecutive wins? Haha, even if I hadn't drained your strength, you'd never have made it! As it stands now, you'll be lucky to make it to 50!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because he's going to defeat you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emma turned and dashed toward the edge of the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her goal of draining Cuthbert's strength had been met. With her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;shattered, she could no longer pose a threat to him with her remaining strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She needed to leave the stage and end this fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think you can just leave? Not so fast!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After suffering such a setback, Cuthbert wasn't about to let Emma walk away so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His rage needed an outlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stay down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Cuthbert appeared in front of Emma and threw a powerful punch at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his&nbsp;Strength Realm&nbsp;amplifying him, his already terrifying strength became monstrous. His massive fist seemed capable of destroying anything in its path. If it hit Emma, she'd be gravely injured, if not killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's expression changed, but she didn't panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Psychic Blast!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A powerful mental assault hit Cuthbert's mind. His face twitched slightly. While he wasn't hurt, his movements were disrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fist still landed hard on Emma, though with much less force. Even so, the crowd heard the sound of bones cracking as her body was violently thrown off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face paled as he saw this. In an instant, he rushed to the edge of the stage and caught Emma's falling body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrible force passed from Emma's body to Osborne, causing his face to turn pale as he stumbled back a few steps before steadying himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Splat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma coughed up blood again. When she saw Osborne holding her, a smile crept onto her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a low voice, she said, "Osborne, I've already drained a lot of his strength. Now it's up to you. Defeat him... avenge me, and avenge Rhett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, she spat out more blood.</p><div class="pagination">
