  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after the battle ended, Valentin and the others appeared on the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Valentin had been severely injured during his fight with Apollo, he was a Class B martial artist and recovered much faster than normal people. At this point, he had already recovered significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Derek with a sharp gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Derek was the head of an ancient family and had lost a son, he had managed to calm himself. However, hearing about fulfilling the one billion dollar wager made his face darken again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This match involved a one-billion-dollar wager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo had guaranteed that he would not lose, which was why Derek had agreed. But the result? Not only did they lose the wager, but Apollo was also dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Valentin was demanding the one billion dollars from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek clenched his fists and coldly said, "What do you want? The wager was made with Apollo. Go find him to fulfill it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's expression immediately turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Derek was not going to honor the wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted and said, "Derek, are you trying to break the agreement? Apollo is dead; are you asking me to go to hell to find him? The wager was made in the name of the Chevalier family. As the head of the Chevalier family, you must honor it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face grew even colder as he sneered, "Valentin, who do you think you are? You are just a hired hand. Do you think you are in a position to talk to me? If you want me to honor the wager, have your boss come and discuss it with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin frowned at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped out from the crowd with a smile and looked directly at Derek. "Derek, I am the boss of Skyefall Security. I am here to discuss this with you. Can you now fulfill the wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's gaze locked onto Osborne. The killing intent that had been subdued now erupted wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it is you, the damn bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you are the mysterious boss of Skyefall Security. You killed my son, and I want you dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's body began to swirl with violent winds, seemingly ready to attack at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin and the others tensed up, gripping their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained calm and said, "Derek, you want to kill me? Fine, as long as you are not afraid of being killed by me, I am ready anytime. But now, you need to honor the wager. It is worth one billion dollars. How do you plan to pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cash? Company shares? Or treasures? Everything is acceptable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's calmness made Derek frown, feeling some unease. Remembering the mysterious expert who had intervened earlier, he ultimately suppressed his killing intent and did not make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coldly said, "What if I refuse to fulfill it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "This match was witnessed by representatives from five ancient families. If you refuse to honor it, do you think they will approve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin glanced at the representatives from the five ancient families with a dark expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five ancient families had been invited by the Chevalier family to witness the match. They were initially worried that Skyefall Security might not honor the wager if they lost, so they used the influence of these families to pressure Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it backfired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Derek remained cold and said, "So what? We have no contract. I do not acknowledge this wager. What can you do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives from the five ancient families all changed their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was the first to speak. "Mr. Chevalier, you are going too far. You invited us to witness the match, and now you are going back on your word. It is a slap in the face to us, and it puts me in a difficult position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right. Since you invited us, we have to ensure that the wager is honored."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, it is best to honor the wager."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives from the five ancient families spoke up, jointly pressuring Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven ancient families of Skyefall had significant competition among them, and seeing the Chevalier family suffer a loss of one billion dollars would hurt the family badly, which they were more than happy to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face was extremely dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly burst into laughter and said coldly, "Today, I am not going to honor it. Let's see who can do anything about it. Want me to pay one billion dollars? You are dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Derek waved his hand and prepared to leave with his people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at him in shock but did not stop him, knowing that if Derek was determined not to acknowledge the wager, their pressure would be useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At most, it would only affect the Chevalier family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family was, after all, an ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, among the seven ancient families in Skyefall, the Chevalier family was one of the most powerful. Even if the five ancient families joined forces, most forces would not dare to defy them, but the Chevalier family had the strength to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five ancient families would not actually go to war with the Chevalier family over this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Derek dared to back out and refuse to honor the wager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "You killed my son and now you want me to pay one billion dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You are definitely dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Valentin's face was extremely grim and filled with anger, but he had no choice but to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coldly snorted and said, "Derek, I advise you to honor the wager. Otherwise, the consequences will be beyond your ability to bear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek abruptly stopped and asked, "Are you threatening me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
