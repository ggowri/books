The Wild Flame Army's quarters were situated on the eastern side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already known that the East Zone Nine housed three major cities: Wild </span><span>Flame City, Inferno City, and </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there were over a dozen large cities, the largest of which was Firestorm City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the Ninth Dark Deity Legion was split into four battalions: Wild Flame Army, Inferno Army, </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> Army, and Firestorm Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, these four battalions formed the complete Ninth Dark Deity Legion, each with varying strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the Inferno Army from Inferno City was recognized as the strongest, followed closely by the </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> Army from </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> City. The Wild Flame Army came next, while the Firestorm Army was considered the weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne and his companions settled into the Wild Flame Army's quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the base, over 50 thousand seasoned veterans emerged to greet the arrival of the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne observed these veterans, his heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that nearly all of them bore injuries, their expressions dulled and weary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they looked at Osborne and his group, their eyes flickered to life, revealing a mix of pity and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, several imposing figures swiftly approached the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena's expression shifted dramatically upon seeing them. With a commanding shout, she rallied everyone to form up, quickly organizing them into five battalions of 10 thousand each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Salute to Vice Commander Angelo Royston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Salute to General Edison Huntington! General Ben Morrison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the ten-thousand-strong battalions bowed respectfully to the three figures at the front, their demeanor shifting to one of reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the names were uttered, excitement erupted among the crowd, their voices buzzing with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Vice Commander Angelo Royston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe I'm finally seeing a Deity King in person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And look, there's General Edison Huntington and General Ben Morrison! They're at the peak of Deity Overlord, and I've heard they're on the verge of breaking through to Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, was swept up in the fervor, taking a moment to size up the three figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was magnetically drawn to Angelo, and his face reflected a mix of surprise and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "So this is what a Deity King warrior looks like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seems completely ordinary! I can't sense any divine power from him at all. Is this what absolute mastery over one's strength looks like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a hint of divine energy leaking out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would need to use the Eclipsing Mantra just to achieve a fraction of that control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard stories about Deity Kings but had never encountered one until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo was one of the three major Vice Commanders of the Wild Flame Army, the highest authority here. Hailing from one of the three strongest Upper Races in Wild Flame City, the Demonic Dragon Clan, he belonged to the formidable Royston family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of memory crossed Osborne's mind as he recalled Myron and Sara, whom he had killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Myron and Sara... weren't </span><span>they</span><span> his children?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jolt, Osborne quickly averted his gaze, keen to avoid any unwanted attention from Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his focus to Edison and Ben, he noted they were both high-ranking generals in the Wild Flame Army, also at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ben hailed from the Mystic Feather Clan and was a talent from the powerful Morrison family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison was from the Soaring Lion Clan and was related to Athena&mdash;he was, in fact, her uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just dealing with Athena has been a headache, and now there's her uncle in the mix, one of the two generals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This complicates things even more," he murmured, eyebrows knitting together in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the trio stood five others, each of whom was also a Deity Overlord, primarily at the later stages of that realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were vice generals of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "What a gathering of talent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the Wild Flame Army here boasts a Deity King, two peak Deity Overlords, five mid-level Deity Overlords, and then there's Athena, who's also no slouch in her realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of these people would be anything I can handle right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Osborne decided to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angelo stepped forward and spoke, "Welcome, everyone, to the Divine Peak Nine base!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
