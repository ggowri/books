  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, the atmosphere was thick with tension as the Eight Dark Sovereigns gathered together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal screen loomed before them, replaying the recent combat matches among the Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the screen, Osborne's enormous blood-red lotus burst into view, sending shockwaves through the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan barely put up a fight before being swiftly cut down, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This harrowing scene had played out dozens of times, each repetition making the mood in the room grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Icy One raised a hand and switched off the display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear what you all think! Losing ten of our Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings is no small blow, not even for a powerhouse like our Paramount Supreme Clan. I can't even begin to explain this mess to the esteemed Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's worse is that they didn't perish at the hands of the God of Light or even from our enemies at the same cultivation level. No, they fell to a bunch of youngsters with barely an Ascension One level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, here we are, still trying to figure out how this all happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened as he spoke, the weight of his words hanging heavily in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the room, his gaze landing on the remaining seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Two, you're the smartest among us, our resident strategist. Share your thoughts&mdash;how did an Ascension One Supernal Deity King take down an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two furrowed his brow, his mind replaying the footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he spoke up, "If my instincts are correct, the problem lies with the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;Osborne. That massive blood-red lotus he summoned? That's likely a special Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect it can manipulate the enemy's judgment and reactions&mdash;something akin to a soul-based attack, which left our ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings completely unable to utilize their full power, resulting in their rapid demise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, murmurs of understanding rippling through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A soul-based attack that affects judgment and reactions, eh?" Icy One echoed, feeling that the situation might not be so straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he struggled to come up with a better explanation. He couldn't comprehend that Osborne's absolute forbidden zone didn't merely affect judgment and reactions; it directly suppressed their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had unfolded too quickly, and the recorded footage didn't provide the full picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression turned grave as he focused on the group. "We need to discuss strategy</span><span> for </span><span>tomorrow's match. Our objective is clear&mdash;we must leverage the competition to crush the morale of the Human Community's coalition while taking Peaks City with minimal losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, given that the Seven Young Deity Kings have suddenly appeared, we've been utterly humiliated in recent matches. The Human Community's coalition isn't just back to full strength; their spirits are soaring! Meanwhile, our Legion's morale has tanked. The distance between us and capturing Peaks City is getting wider by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We cannot afford to repeat this scenario in tomorrow's match! We must reclaim our honor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the seven fell into a heavy silence, the weight of their predicament pressing down upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Icy Two who broke the silence. "The talents and abilities of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are downright terrifying. Under normal circumstances, winning against them in the matches seems nearly impossible! Unless we change the rules or... eliminate them entirely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Seven Young Deity Kings are alive, we won't stand a chance in the Supernal Deity King matches. Each bout incurs huge losses, and that's simply unacceptable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I propose we do whatever it takes to take out the Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they're gone, we can turn the tide of the matches and ensure they don't come back to haunt us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their potential is too great! I hate to admit it, but even our Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions can't hold a candle to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most alarming of them all is Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension One Supernal Deity King with the power to rival an Ascension Four? Even the former strongest of the Human Community, the God of Night, or our esteemed Lord Malevolence, wouldn't have stood a chance against an Ascension Four at their own Ascension One level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a look of shock lingered in Icy Two's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and continued with resolve, "We can't afford to give Osborne any more time to grow! We can't let the Seven Young Deity Kings gain any strength either! If they level up even slightly, we'll be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must act while their cultivation levels are still low and eliminate them at all costs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Icy Two finished, the others nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm with Icy Two! Winning or losing the matches isn't the end of the world for us! Even if we keep losing, when the full-scale war starts, it's all about raw power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our strength, we can win no matter what! The only difference is how much time and resources we'll have to expend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community simply doesn't have the power to stand against us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if the Seven Young Deity Kings all reach their full potential... they could become the new Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community! That would be a real nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We can't let them grow any stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must be eliminated swiftly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At any cost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eight Dark Sovereigns found rare consensus in their opinions, all agreeing that the Seven Young Deity Kings needed to be dealt with immediately. If they could take them out, all their problems would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One nodded thoughtfully. "Since we all agree that the biggest obstacle is the Seven Young Deity Kings, let's figure out how to eliminate them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we know the God of Light will go to great lengths to protect them. Taking them out under her watch won't be easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One frowned after saying that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If all eight of us strike together, even the God of Light won't be able to stop us! Let's contact our spies embedded in the Human Community to pinpoint the Seven Young Deity Kings' location, and then we'll </span><span>start action</span><span> immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must act fast! We can't give the God of Light any more time to prepare. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to take down the Seven Young Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should strike tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the God of Light is powerful, but she's just one person! If we send five or six of us to hold her off, the rest can take out the Seven Young Deity Kings and then retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on board with that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eight Dark Sovereigns quickly hashed out their action plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, news from their spies infiltrating the Human Community came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Young Deity Kings were currently being kept under the watchful eye of the God of Light, still within the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! They think hiding in the Sanctum of Light will keep them safe? Ridiculous! No time to waste&mdash;let's get ready to move!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
