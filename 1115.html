  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hardly believe his eyes. Here he was, in the heart of the Aberrants' lair, and he had stumbled upon Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked him even more was the realization that, after all this time, she had transformed into a Class AAA warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few months ago, he had seen her on the Augustine family's cruise ship in Dampston, just as a regular person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had nearly lost her life on that ship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Evelyn begging him to save her, Ophelia would have been a goner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, in less than four months, she had gone from being an ordinary human to a Class AAA warrior right in the den of his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, with all his training, had taken ten months to ascend from a regular person to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was already a remarkable feat, but Ophelia had done it in less than half the time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed as he sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care about her attitude; after all, they had become strangers after the divorce. No matter how she treated him, it didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he needed to understand the situation&mdash;why was she here, and what was her connection to Gerardo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way," Ophelia said coldly, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stepped in front of her, his voice icy. "Sorry, but you can't leave just yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia glared at him, her anger palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this? You planning to kill me? Go ahead! I admit that divorcing you was a mistake, and I regret it! If you want to end me, just do it! The Caldwell family is gone; I have no one left. Dying at your hands would be a relief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, taken aback. "What did you say? The Caldwell family is gone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a wave of disorientation wash over him. No matter how much he had suffered during his time with the Caldwell family, he had still been a part of it for three years. Hearing that the family had been wiped out struck a nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia sneered, saying, "That</span><span>'</span><span>s right! The Caldwell family has been wiped out! Gerardo did it! Are you happy now? ended up here because he kidnapped me. If he hadn't thought I had potential and wanted to take me on as his disciple, I would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, thanks to you for pushing Gerardo into a corner. That's how I got the chance to take revenge for the Caldwell family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that I've avenged them, I'm leaving. So, move aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You killed Gerardo?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened, rage and murderous intent boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia flinched at the intensity of his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that a good thing? Didn't you always want him dead? Now that I've done the dirty work, you don't have to worry about him anymore!" she shot back, trying to hold her ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, his fury palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Gerardo is dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this happen? He can't just die so easily! Not before I've had my chance to make him suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Ophelia completely, Osborne charged into the chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found Gerardo sprawled out, head hanging low, a dagger embedded in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The life had drained from him, and he was unmistakably dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo's really dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, I'll find a way to bring you back and make you suffer again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, Osborne unleashed the Light of Redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even this powerful ability couldn't breathe life back into Gerardo. The man lay still, having been dead for too long; the magic simply couldn't reach him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of despair wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the look on his face, Ophelia frowned and asked, "What's wrong? I helped you kill Gerardo, but you don't seem happy about it. Did you really not want him dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her an intense glare, fury igniting in his eyes. "Of course I wanted to kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But more than that, I wanted to torture him, to make him pay for what he did! He killed my sister, Anastasia!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of his words struck Ophelia dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret surged through her; nobody understood better than her just how much Anastasia meant to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia was killed by Gerardo? No wonder Osborne is so furious," Ophelia thought, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I didn't know. If you want to blame someone, blame me! I keep messing up, again and again, but I swear it wasn't intentional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped back to reality, looking into Ophelia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remorse etched across her face caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed genuinely changed, a stark contrast to the Ophelia he used to know&mdash;someone who would never apologize so sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand dismissively. "Just go! This isn't your fault. You're just trying to avenge someone you cared about, just like I am."</span></p><div class="pagination">
