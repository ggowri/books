  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lacked precise measuring tools, relying instead on rough estimation, which left plenty of room for error.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over twenty times the increase!" Osborne breathlessly exclaimed, feeling the exhilaration course through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had reached a peak, a limit he could sense&mdash;without a breakthrough to Class S, any further improvement seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ordinary Class AAA had a physical strength of just 0.1, while prodigies like the Lord only achieved 0.6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he stood, boasting a strength level of 220!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was thousandfold more than a typical Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This newfound limit stemmed from his unique nature; after all, it was the merging of the soul of powers with his body that allowed for such extraordinary results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that his limits far surpassed those of any other Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the newfound limits that made him acutely feel the barrier separating him from Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a powerful opportunity for a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within, a vast reservoir of energy surged, just waiting to be harnessed. However, due to reaching his current limits, he couldn't absorb it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Osborne took one more step forward, he could easily break into Class S and absorb that energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break the limits and break into Class S?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that if he simply meditated for a few days, he could manage the transition without help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I go for it?" Osborne wondered, the conviction quickly taking root in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, with such a golden opportunity at hand, how could he possibly hesitate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he had thought the leap to Class S would be a daunting task. He had planned to wait for Clarissa to wake up and use her fate power to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, knowing he could achieve this on his own, why should Osborne rely on someone else's strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rigorous cleansing of fate power would only strengthen him; once he broke through to Class S, that very process would have even greater benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it's settled! I'll break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before start, he contacted First, the head of Blood Demon, to ensure the Augustine family was safe and sound. Bryce and Kendra had returned unharmed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also let Wesson know he'd be entering seclusion for the next few days so he could work on breaking into Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With preparations complete, Osborne began his retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first he needed a secure place to do that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled up his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is nearly 2,000 miles from Newport City and about 1,500 miles from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' base. There's not a single nation within a radius of 300 miles! I should be safe from any interruptions here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But who brought me here? Did they know I was planning to go into seclusion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it have been Isa? I called out for her right before Gerardo tossed me into the Human Slave tank, but she didn't show up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Isa has the means to save me and think ahead, securing me such a safe spot for my breakthrough. But why hasn't she come to see me before leaving?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because she's lost faith in me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened. Isa had been clear. She wouldn't intervene with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. She wanted Osborne to handle his troubles on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn&rsquo;t do as she told. He called for her help again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with me?" Osborne began reflection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the second time Gerardo had captured him! If it hadn't been for Gerardo's twisted mercy, trying to keep him alive to turn him into a Human Slave, Osborne would have already been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Maybe Isa really is disappointed in me. How could I be so foolish, so reckless as to let Gerardo catch me twice? I can't even forgive myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, Gerardo has managed to capture me because he possesses spatial power as well, and his abilities are a level stronger than mine. He has the perfect advantage to counter me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that doesn't excuse the fact that this is the second time I've been taken captive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only I had been more cautious! If only my spatial power were stronger! Then, I wouldn't have fallen into Gerardo's trap. I wouldn't have let Isa down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This will be the last time I'm captured by an enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been too arrogant, too inflated in my self-worth. From now on, I refuse to let this happen again! Once I break into Class S, all my energy will go into honing my spatial power. I need to make sure I can escape when the time comes&mdash;no more falling back on Isa for help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, he had something more pressing to focus on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First... I have to break through Class S! Once I accomplish that, my strength will skyrocket! Even the top-tier Class S opponents won't stand a chance against me! I have to make this move quickly, then I'll head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found the barrier to Class S visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to control his power, channeling it to strike directly at the barrier.</span></p><div class="pagination">
