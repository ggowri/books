  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne now realized that it seemed no one could fuse four different powers before reaching Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he thought it was because others weren't strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel had reached the top five ranking battles, but all the opponents he encountered had fused only three powers, including Clara, Leroy, Seraphina, and other princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, due to varying intensity, Sacred Power fused with three powers also differed in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was certain that Osborne had yet to find anyone who fused a fourth power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy used the Top-grade Dragon Elixir and entered the Enlightenment State. However, they still didn't fuse more powers in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems that fusing three powers is the limit for warriors before reaching Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne controlled his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only fused the powers of space, thunder, and fire elemental essence, and used the Sacred Power formed by these three to fight, avoiding others discovering he had fused more powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had the Sublime Concealment Orb, making it hard for others to discover his true state, there were simply too many warriors present.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Frederick, who was about to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, was present. The Sublime Concealment Orb couldn't guarantee that Osborne's true state wouldn't be discovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, the Sacred Power fused with just three forces was already strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the very least, his current Sacred Power was stronger than Seraphina's. Otherwise, he couldn't have used the Bloodwrought Bow, a Superior Sacred Artifact, to contend evenly with Seraphina's Blackstar Bow, a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Osborne's and Seraphina's arrows collided once again, exploding simultaneously and vanishing, neither able to overpower the other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already Seraphina's third arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Seraphina's expression turn somewhat serious and a bit grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had previously said Osborne could only block three of Seraphina's arrows were left with their mouths wide open, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three arrows were over, but Osborne was still standing there just fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the battle with Seraphina, Osborne displayed strength that was in no way weaker than hers. It was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina snorted coldly, "Damn it! You really surprised me. You actually blocked my three Twinkling Star Arrows with that trashy Superior Sacred Artifact bow. But in the end, victory will undoubtedly be mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow has a total of seven arrows, and the first three aren't strong. Starting from the fourth arrow, its power will skyrocket. I'm really curious how long you can hold on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a massive Twinkling Star Arrow shot out again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel that the power of the Twinkling Star Arrow had increased significantly. Such an attack could definitely kill most warriors at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's strong, but that's all it is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly drew the Bloodwrought Bow. "Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power Arrow shot out and instantly split into more Sacred Power Arrows. In the blink of an eye, the sky was filled with Sacred Power Arrows. They flew out and collided with Seraphina's fourth Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, Osborne's Arrow Storm was shattered this time. However, Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow wasn't completely destroyed and still charged toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne reacted quickly. He swiftly used spatial power and dodged the attack of the Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the Twinkling Star Arrow struck the protective shield outside the arena, causing it to shake violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained uninjured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina couldn't help but laugh because she finally gained the upper hand. If Osborne hadn't dodged quickly, she would have injured him with that arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled and said, "It seems you're almost at your limit. But my Twinkling Star Arrow still has three more shots, and each one is stronger. You will eventually be defeated by me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina launched another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and thought, "You have three more arrows? Sorry. I just finished using the Human Arrow of the Solar Sacred Arrow. Next, I still have the Earth Arrow and Heaven Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earth Arrow has four moves, and Heaven Arrow has one. So, I still have five arrows."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow again. Seraphina's previous Twinkling Star Arrow suddenly became much stronger, while he was still using the slightly weaker Human Arrow, which put him at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But next, Osborne was about to start using the Earth Arrow. "Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Single-Arrow Launch!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Earth Arrow, in addition to containing his own immense Sacred Power, was also compressed by him, making it explosively powerful, far surpassing the Human Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twinkling Star Arrow, the fifth arrow! With this arrow, I will defeat you. Twinkle!" Seraphina shouted fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Blackstar Bow stood tall before her. Under her control, the bowstring automatically drew back. Then, a pitch-black Twinkling Star Arrow took shape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After this Twinkling Star Arrow appeared, the entire arena trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina's eyes were filled with confidence. When she unleashed the fourth arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow, Osborne could barely fend off her Twinkling Star Arrow using Arrow Storm, and she ultimately gained the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she believed Osborne had reached his limit, while she could still grow stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt the fifth arrow was enough to defeat Osborne. At the same cultivation level, this was the first time someone had forced her to unleash the fifth arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, you will definitely lose!" Seraphina said firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Twinkling Star Arrow shot toward Osborne at lightning speed. The massive Twinkling Star Arrow almost covered half of the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow held only an incredibly dim Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Seraphina even more confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne's dim Sacred Power Arrow shot out and instantly rushed toward her Twinkling Star Arrow. It looked like an ant charging at a tiger, utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next second, Seraphina's expression changed again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment it collided with her Twinkling Star Arrow, Osborne's dim Sacred Power Arrow suddenly erupted in an incredibly terrifying explosion. The blast swept across the entire arena, even creating small torn spaces at the very center of the stage, instantly obliterating and devouring the power of her Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the explosive force surged toward her and struck her Blackstar Bow. After trembling violently for a moment, the explosive force finally dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" At this moment, Seraphina was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought her arrow could defeat Osborne. But it was shattered and devoured by Osborne's incredibly dim Sacred Power Arrow. Moreover, the explosive force even continued to attack her. If the Blackstar Bow hadn't blocked the explosive force for her, she would have been in an extremely sorry state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina thought, "How is this possible? The power of the fifth Twinkling Star Arrow is stronger than the fourth. He could barely withstand my fourth arrow. Why did he easily crush my fifth arrow instead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a trace of confusion and panic appeared on Seraphina's face, as this was already the fifth Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, she hadn't posed any threat to Osborne. The strength Osborne displayed in the arena was completely on par with hers, which she couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina had absolute confidence in herself. She believed that among those who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness, no one could rival her. Even if such a person existed, they couldn't possibly be in a place like the Racial Convergence Stellar Region on the edge of the universe but would be found deeper within the cosmos.</span></p><div class="pagination">
