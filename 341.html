  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific attacks fell on Osborne, making a deafening sound. The sea surface was fluctuating violently, creating high waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Devil's Light was powerful enough, the full-strength attacks of two Class A- metahumans still exceeded the defense limit of the Devil's Light. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, after Osborne transformed into a Vampire, his physical defense became stronger, and he only suffered minor injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After vomiting out a mouthful of blood, he had recovered a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face looked pale and stern. He ignored the two metahumans who posed a more significant threat to him but stared at the three martial artists not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to break the besiegement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being besieged by five Class A- masters, Osborne was under tremendous pressure and was restricted. He had to get rid of one or two of them first to break their alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeating the relatively weak opponents first was a good way to change the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the two metahumans, the martial artists were relatively weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three martial artists found that Osborne was not seriously injured, and their faces suddenly became solemn. They looked at each other and attacked him again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they couldn't kill Osborne, they had to entangle him so that the two metahumans could have more time to prepare for the fatal attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks were still so swift and powerful, and every punch could cause a sonic boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was </span><span>one of a kind</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After transforming into a Vampire, Osborne was stronger than before in strength, speed, and reaction. He avoided the three martial artists' attacks easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the three men and sneered, "Just now, you beat me up enough. Now, it's my turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne flashed and moved in front of a martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attack also made a sonic boom. He punched the Class A- martial artist's chest, and the man was blown away in an instant with an incredulous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two martial artists were shocked, but their attacks were not slow at all. They took advantage of the slight pause when Osborne attacked that man and punched him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Osborne didn't even shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned and stared at a martial artist again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's your turn!" Osborne kicked hard in the man's chest. There was a sound of broken bones. The man screamed, vomited blood, and fell into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last martial artist was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't give him time to react. He rushed forward, grabbed his shoulders, and struck him on the chin with his knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's jaw was instantly shattered, and he roared in pain like a wild beast. He attacked frantically, trying to break Osborne's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne tightly grasped the man's shoulders and endured his attacks. Soon, he struck the man on his chest with his knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's chest caved in deeply, and his eyes widened with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were </span><span>an average person that had taken the blow, they would definitely have passed out.</span><span> However, the man was still conscious. Under the fear of death, he used all his strength and kicked Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man roared, "Fuck you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne moved first and smashed the man's knee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, "You beat me so fierce just now, but now you can't stand just a few hits from me. You dared scold me. You are courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne stared at the man as if he was dead. He pressed the man's neck with both hands and kicked him again. His knee hit the man's head hard like a sledgehammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man despaired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he couldn't avoid Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed both hands on the man's neck. No matter how the man struggled, he could not push Osborne away. Osborne's knee was getting closer and closer to his head. He felt the breath of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a Class A- martial artist, his head would explode if Osborne's knee hit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man shouted, "Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two anxious voices suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two metahumans finally couldn't hold back anymore. In an instant, countless metal elements approached Osborne. Before Osborne could react, they wrapped his body tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne seemed to be wearing a suit of steel armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was restrained, </span><span>so, he couldn&rsquo;t kick the man&rsquo;s head</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal elements that enveloped Osborne were increasing rapidly, and soon, he was restrained in a metal ball, which was like a prison, trapping him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, feeling that his body was somewhat difficult to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying ice elemental covered the metal ball, freezing it and making it </span><span>impenetrable</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a huge sphere made of metal and ice appeared on the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It floated there, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men in black looked at each other with a look of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, we trapped him."</span></p><div class="pagination">
