  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger flared on Hannah's beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man beside her smiled and said, "In Celestara, outside of the West Zone, the Human Community struggles. It's not surprising that the Swift family would make such a choice. At least this way, they can live better in Wild Flame City, and the other factions won't target them too aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What they fail to see is that each time they back down or show weakness, they may avoid becoming a threat, but they also earn the scorn of those around them. They only invite more contempt for themselves and the entire Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Swift family has hit their ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their existence offers no real help to the other Humans in Wild Flame City; in fact, it makes life even harder and more humiliating for everyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to think that the Swift family, being the top force of the Human Community, would stand apart from the others. But now I see they're even weaker than many of the other factions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes reflected disdain as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder asked, his smile widening, "Oh? What do you think of Lachlan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've had some interaction with him, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah paused, a frown crossing her face as Lachlan's image flickered in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... He seems different. But I haven't interacted with him enough to say for sure. Overall, he feels unlike anyone else in the Human Community. He's either a complete madman or a genius who could change our situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Oh? That's your take?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded earnestly. "Honestly, the things he's done baffle me. I can't see how they would change the Human Community's standing in Wild Flame City. It's like he's fearless, reckless even.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't shake the feeling that there's more to it, that his actions have a purpose I just can't grasp yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll need to spend more time with him to understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Hannah caught the elder watching her with a knowing smile, causing her cheeks to flush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled heartily. "You're interested in him, and that's a good thing! After all these years, he's the first person to catch your attention. I support you in getting to know him better. Remember, the line between genius and madness is often razor-thin! But he's in a tough spot right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian is a Deity Overlord, while he's just a Transcendent Deity. If the Swift family doesn't step in, he won't stand a chance against Fabian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's brow furrowed tightly at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, please help him! With your reputation, one word from you and Fabian would back off. No one would dare to challenge him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes pleaded with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder shook his head firmly. "No, I won't intervene. And why are you asking me to do this? You can handle it yourself! Hannah, you're grown up now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah blinked in surprise, then bit her lip, nodding resolutely. "I understand what I need to do! If he's in danger later, I'll save him! I can't let someone I'm finally interested in just die like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good," the elder replied with a smile, leaving the matter there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time dragged on slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Calvin had contacted Walter, he fell silent, letting the tension in the air thicken. More warriors from the Swift family arrived, merging into his ranks, but the other factions hardly paid them any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Lachlan was dead, they would all compete based on their own merits; the presence of the Swift family didn't really change the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the slave market, the atmosphere grew increasingly anxious as midnight approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of Spark of Blaze were on edge, glancing at the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Mr. Lachlan Swift? He should have been out by now! It's almost midnight, and the slave market is about to close!" one of them exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the market's windows, they could see and hear the chaos outside, each person's expression reflecting the gravity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a perilous position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't deal with Fabian today, Spark of Blaze would crumble, and they would be hunted like prey by the other factions, likely to end up back on the auction block by morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only hope rested on "Lachlan".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the secret chamber, Osborne had been meditating for over two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only half an hour left before the slave market closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the outside world had passed just over two hours, Osborne had experienced the equivalent of two hundred hours of training&mdash;nearly ten days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this intense period of focus, he had finally absorbed the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At last, Osborne opened his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
