  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than two hundred direct descendants of the Augustine family watched the unfolding battle with bated breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Nathan conjure a ball of fire with a flick of his wrist, they erupted in loud cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kaden transformed into a towering giant, the cheers resounded once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are the bright young stars of our Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With them here, our Augustine family shall not falter! That lad is too audacious, daring to take on four of them alone. I fear he won't even best one of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, he's been estranged from our family since childhood, deprived of any resources. Even if he possesses talent, he's been left far behind by his peers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I truly cannot fathom why The Wise Order chose him as the heir. I believe Ryan is the most fitting. Ryan is the sole Class B+ metahuman among the younger generation. Only he can represent the Augustine family and hold his own against the heirs of other ancient clans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, I also believe Ryan is the most suitable. He is gentle and refined, averse to conflict and competition. Whether in terms of strength, temperament, wisdom, or character, he is the most fitting to be the heir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I strongly advocate for Ryan to be the heir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This suggestion from the crowd garnered many nods of agreement, for everyone knew that Ryan was the strongest among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Ryan was a genuinely good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could always get along well with everyone, considerate to both his elders and his peers. When his name was mentioned, nothing but praise followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the tragic accident befalling Allen, Ryan had become the most likely heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie were nearly convinced by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cease your clamoring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian bellowed, "The Wise Order will naturally decide who shall succeed. Your outcry is futile! Moreover, Osborne has already accepted the challenge, facing four opponents alone. What right do you have to voice your opinions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if he prevails?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prevail? How could he possibly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone scoffed disdainfully, "He's merely delusional. I'm sure he'll be defeated shortly! He stood there immobile, clearly pinned down by Ryan's controlled gravity. He's unable to move. I daresay he's already regretting his decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the next instant, he shall be vanquished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd's words faded, Osborne, who had been motionless, suddenly stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense gravity made the simple act of raising his hands arduous, yet his movements were unwaveringly resolute and grew easier with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this juncture, the fireball controlled by Nathan arrived before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly and waved gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a layer of emerald Devil's Light enveloped Osborne's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the fireball that had shot towards Osborne, before it could cause any harm, was blown to smithereens in the air by Osborne's casual wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sparks scattered everywhere, a spectacle of breathtaking beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight instantly altered the expressions on Ryan and Nathan's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan furrowed his brows tightly and swiftly formed hand seals, intensifying the gravity on Osborne even further and attempting to suppress him until he was immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how Ryan augmented it, Osborne remained composed and unaffected. He continued to wave his hand gently, shattering one fireball after another in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was equally stunned. "I underestimated you! Earlier, I was merely concerned about injuring you, so I didn't exert my full strength at all. Since you possess such prowess, I shall hold nothing back. Witness my move once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boiling Sea of Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan roared angrily, and a sea of fire suddenly surged beneath Osborne's feet, burning ferociously and engulfing Osborne in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's body was cloaked in a layer of faint emerald Devil's Light at this time. No matter how fiercely the sea of fire burned, it could not harm Osborne in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should savor this sea of fire yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. Not only could Nathan control fire, but so could he. Moreover, his power surpassed Nathan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne seized control of Nathan's sea of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, leading the fierce sea of fire to fly towards Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was horrified and tried desperately to regain control but to no avail. He could only flee in panic, and his clothes were still set ablaze by the flames. At last, he let out a shrill scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Kaden had already charged in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his massive fist high and slammed it towards Osborne's chest. The colossal force of his fist seemed capable of destroying everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne remained unruffled; he merely slowly raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden's massive fist collided with Osborne's palm, producing a resounding noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Kaden was rolled out directly, looking extremely disheveled. He left a deep crater on the ground and looked up at Osborne in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned to discover that Osborne's might surpassed his own, even in his colossal form!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Nathan and Kaden were defeated. If Osborne had not held back, they would have been injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Ryan's gravity could not restrain Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the only one still capable of fighting was Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie looked solemn. With a swiftness born of certainty, she unleashed her power, a force of mind control, invisible yet potent, morphing in an instant into a myriad of ethereal arrows. They hurtled towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind control? I master that art, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden activation of Satan's Eye, Osborne used his ocular energy to cast a penetrating glance. At that moment, those arrows froze in mid-air. Then, with a malevolent twist, they reversed their course and propelled back towards Queenie with a velocity that doubled their initial speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of soft thuds punctuated the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows pierced Queenie's garments with unerring accuracy. She stood motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lost!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
