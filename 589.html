  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced at Owen and smiled, "I am the number one genius in the Augustine family while you, Owen, are not. Is that fair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone in the Augustine family hailed her as the number one genius. He had long been dissatisfied with this, believing his own talent was just as great as hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The number one genius? I think you're a genius at bragging!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never seen you in a fight over the years. How can you claim to be the number one genius of the Augustine family? Besides, you haven't even activated your Satan's Eye. How can you become Godfather's successor?" Owen sneered with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was unfazed. "I haven't activated my Satan's Eye, not because I can't, but because I choose not to! Even without it, I can still defeat you. Doesn't that show I'm more talented? To me, you're nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous! How could you possibly defeat me? Let's have a fight and see who is stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Matthew suddenly stopped Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, "Owen, we are all the prospective heirs to the Augustine family. Although we are competitors, there is no need to target each other. After all, we are a family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to compete and decide the winner, do it another time. Today is Godfather's birthday party. You'd better not make a scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather has his own judgment when choosing a successor. He doesn't select simply based on talent or strength. We should focus on our own paths."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Owen snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that today wasn't the right time to compete with Emma, he said icily, "Emma, if you want a competition after today, I'll be available anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled, "Fighting with you is just a waste of time. You are no match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was enraged once more but was stopped by Matthew again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you are well aware of Emma's temper. Why are you arguing with her? In her eyes, aside from you, even Vincent and I are not taken seriously. She considers most people useless except for a few in the world. Just ignore her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen snorted coldly but said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, locked in the dungeon, couldn't help but laugh while watching and listening to their conversations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma is so arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's around my age, just a few months younger, but she doesn't take Owen seriously at all. I suspect she's at least Class AA. Her talent is truly impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did a great job of irritating Owen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to observe the five people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixth test of succession from Godfather demanded that he become the top heir to the Augustine family. To achieve this, he had to compete against them and emerge victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he learned about them, the more his confidence grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, at 45 years old, is the eldest and strongest among them. He maintains the calmest demeanor and appears to dismiss the others lightly. He is the only one of the five who has achieved Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is an exceptionally formidable figure globally! He also possesses a mutated Satan's Eye and is rumored to be the one in the Augustine family most likely to elevate it to level seven. If victory is solely determined by strength, the others will stand no chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne analyzed them inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, at 38 years old, is a top Class AA master, on par with Ms. Hernandez. He possesses talent comparable to Vincent, excelling in both powers and martial arts, and his Satan's Eye is also at level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his strength and talent may not be the greatest, his methods and wisdom are unmatched among the few. He will be a formidable opponent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Owen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Owen with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his opinion, Owen was the least concerning of the four prospective heirs to the Augustine family's main bloodline. At 31 years old, his strength was likely inferior to Emma's, making him the weakest among them. His talent, methods, and wisdom offered no notable advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the threat posed by Owen was not even as significant as that posed by Lance from the branch bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person Osborne planned to deal with was Owen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never forget that Owen had slapped Yulissa, and he would seek vengeance for it soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed at Emma, unable to see through her. At 25 years old, she was recognized as the number one genius in the Augustine family, and there was definitely a reason for that. Without Satan's Eye, she only relied on other powers to get such an evaluation. Her talent was absolutely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her strength was also unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even felt that she was not much weaker than Matthew and was likely at Class AA as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance, aged thirty-three, came from Yalynch, the most powerful branch bloodline of the Augustine family. Having grown up there, he was acknowledged as the most powerful within that bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne didn't have the chance to fight against Lance in the Branch Bloodline Competition, leaving him unsure of his exact strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he guessed Lance shouldn't be more potent than Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne believed that if he desired to pass Godfather's sixth test of succession and become the top heir to the Augustine family, Vincent, Matthew, and Emma were his only three major competitors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to defeat them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, there was a sudden commotion at the birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Godfather is here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
