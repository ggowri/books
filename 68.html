  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;Wesley, stop being hypocritical. It&rsquo;s just 15 million dollars. You gave me 60 million dollars at the auction. I can afford it. But I won&rsquo;t be as stupid as you and spend 15 million dollars on a piece of junk.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was furious when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What happened at the auction was a shame for him. Now that Osborne was bringing it up again, he couldn&rsquo;t suppress his anger anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said disdainfully, &ldquo;You useless piece of trash. What do you know anything about diamond? How dare you say this piece of diamond is trash? I think you are jealous and envious. Unfortunately, even if you have 60 million dollars, I won&rsquo;t sell this uncut diamond to you. I&rsquo;ll cut it myself. You&rsquo;d better not be scared to death after I cut it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed, &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait and see.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne no longer paid attention to Wesley. He continued to look for the best diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The average quality of polished materials was obviously much higher than that of rough materials. Almost every piece of polished material contains a diamond. Their difference lay in quality, color, size, and cracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The price of polished materials was also much higher than that of raw materials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The cheapest ones cost tens of thousands of dollars. Most cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. The most expensive one even cost tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Wesley&rsquo;s uncut diamond was not the most expensive. It was not even among the top three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was standing in front of a huge piece of the uncut diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This piece of uncut diamond was half a person&rsquo;s height and weighed 1.5 tons. It had been cut in the middle. The diamond inside was not small in size but a mostly medium-quality icy diamond. They were full of cracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was only a hint of green at the edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was this hint of green that made the price of these uncut diamonds still very high. It needed five million dollars to buy it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne knew that the value of these uncut diamonds was far more than five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you interested in this uncut diamond?&rdquo; Alison couldn&rsquo;t help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison showed worry and advised, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take another look? This uncut diamond is very famous. It has been here for three years. Countless uncut diamond masters have looked at it. All of them have concluded that it is very likely that there are cracks all over it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This uncut diamond was once worth 20 million dollars. A real estate owner couldn&rsquo;t resist buying it and cutting it once. But it was full of cracks. He didn&rsquo;t dare to cut it any further and sold it to the casino for three million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As a result, the casino wants to sold it for five million dollars. Anyone who buys it is a fool.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Alison finished speaking, Osborne looked at her speechlessly. &ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m a fool?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison said seriously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. I was just talking about the facts.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I can be the fool. Drag this piece to the cutting machine. Cut it for me on the spot along this line.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he continued searching regardless of Alison&rsquo;s dissuasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The piece of uncut diamonds contained a lot of secrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The surface was all cracked. But if you dug two centimeters deeper, all the cracks would disappear. The inner side was all top-grade glass-type.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was also the top-grade diamond. Moreover, it weighed at least fifteen pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To upgrade the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level three, Osborne needed 22 pounds of top-quality diamond. As long as he cut these uncut diamonds, he could upgrade the Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne was somewhat unwilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, &ldquo;The better the diamond I use to upgrade, the more powerful the Satan&rsquo;s Eye will be. This type of diamond is definitely not as good as imperial green. I still want to use Imperial Green diamond to upgrade.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickened his pace and looked around in a hurry. Even though he saw uncut diamonds worth millions or even tens of millions of dollars, he won&rsquo;t stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other side, several pieces of uncut diamonds were being cut in a row of large cutting machines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia stood aside. They both have expectant looks in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, don&rsquo;t worry. The uncut diamond I selected must be flawless. It will definitely have top-quality diamond. I can design a set of rare jewelry for you,&rdquo; Wesley said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia nodded. She believed in Wesley&rsquo;s judgment. After all, the Ashford family specialized in this business. Their vision and experience were much better than that of ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia began to look forward to the scene of herself wearing rare jewelry and having the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although she and Osborne had been married, they did not hold a wedding. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Which woman does not expect to wear a luxurious dress and top-quality jewelry to have a grand and solemn wedding?</span> Ophelia thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, I have booked a five-star hotel. After we cut diamond, we can go have a couple of drinks to celebrate.&rdquo; Wesley was full of anticipation at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia hesitated for a moment. She wondered, &ldquo;It is already nighttime. I know what Wesley meant by booking a five-star hotel. Celebrating is just an excuse. Wesley just wants to sleep with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s words made Ophelia feel somewhat disgusted and resistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when Ophelia thought that they would be officially married soon, she suddenly accepted his offer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look first. If we really cut out top-quality diamond, then we&rsquo;ll go celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was overjoyed when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed to envision the scene of Ophelia lying on a king-size bed in a five-star hotel, allowing him to do anything.</p><div class="pagination">
