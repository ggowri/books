  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chilling sounds echoed ominously, everyone froze in disbelief, their eyes wide with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying attacks unleashed by Ricky and Tyrese came crashing toward Emma but abruptly transformed into a molten mass that solidified instantly, as if meeting a sudden chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every assault they had launched was inexplicably frozen and petrified in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a thunderous explosion, the energy shattered, leaving nothing in the sky but Emma, unharmed and standing tall amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky, Tyrese and the others had launched all-out attacks with every ounce of their strength. But it was as if they were swatting at the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The incredulity hit Ricky and the others like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had poured their all into this fight, believing that with their combined might, there was no way even an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King could withstand their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emma was merely an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, so how could she possibly fend off their collective attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected her to be torn to shreds, reduced to nothing more than a gory mess on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here she was, merely showing off an eerie white eye that had effortlessly nullified their every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ricky and his crew felt a chill creep into their bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the unsettling white eye left them tense and wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, with a nonchalant smile, addressed them coolly, "Is this really the best you can do? Coming to Celestara Planet to make a fool of yourselves? You'd be better off staying away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, her voice hardened. "Death's Beam!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the haunting eye shot out beams of blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sliced through the air like lasers aimed directly at Ricky, Tyrese, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, a wave of unshakeable dread surged through the seven of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky bellowed, his instincts kicking in as he began to dodge, frantically casting layers of divine power barriers around him, flinging Apex divine artifacts into the mix for added protection&mdash;anything to shield himself from the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the others followed suit, preparing for the worst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to their horror, the speed of the beams exceeded anything they had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were way too fast to evade, forcing them to brace for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beams struck their defenses, and the shock was instantaneous. They watched in terror as their protective barriers crumbled under the force, the Apex divine artifacts around them withering and disintegrating as if they were made of nothing more than fragile glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death power!" Ricky shouted, panic coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sensed the undeniable essence of death looming in the air. He knew that if that light touched him, he'd suffer the same fate as their once-reliable artifacts&mdash;decaying, lifeless, and reduced to nothing in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Let's pool our powers together to fend this off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation clawed at Ricky as he summoned his teammates to join forces, but their efforts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the Apex divine artifacts fell under the relentless assault of the deadly beams, crumbling into worthless scraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their defenses were rapidly deteriorating, and the color drained from their faces as the gravity of the situation sunk in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't find a way out, they'd soon face the ultimate demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maddox Corenswet! We need help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky couldn't care less about pride anymore; fear pushed him to shout for assistance, his voice filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Maddox observed with a scowl, his initial plan to enjoy the spectacle unraveling before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought it would be a straightforward display of power, but here he was, watching as Ricky and Tyrese scrambled to survive against Emma's rising wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the looks of it, Emma hadn't even begun to unleash her full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was just an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, while Ricky stood at Ascension Eight, and Tyrese and his companions were also Ascension Seven warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to their utter shock, all seven of them had been crushed in an instant by Emma's overwhelming power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's expression darkened, irritation etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after all, Ricky and Tyrese were his fellow disciples&mdash;he couldn't just stand by and watch them meet a grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed, trying to mask his annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of useless fools! I've warned you all to practice diligently and sharpen your skills! But did you listen? Now look where it's got you! Getting steamrolled by a girl with a lower cultivation level? And you still have the nerve to call for my help?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Useless! When we get back to the Mystic Sirius Sect, you'll have to face the consequences yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, a crackling bolt of lightning descended from above, targeting Emma and the eerie white eye hovering before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression hardened in an instant as she fell back, barely evading the lethal strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunderbolt smashed down into the spot where she had just stood, shattering the very fabric of the air around it. Had she hesitated even a moment longer, the explosion might have blown her apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now without the chance to retaliate against Ricky and the others, Emma found herself thrown into a defensive position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky and the others, sensing their narrow escape, quickly rushed to Maddox's side, their faces reflecting their harrowing close call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Maddox Corenswet!" they gasped in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox waved them off, his attention fixated on Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glared back at him, fury coursing through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Maddox's intervention, she felt certain she could have wiped out Ricky, Tyrese, and their companions without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, unfazed by her withering gaze, gave a faint smile. "So, you're the God of Death among the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community? Impressive! No wonder Zayne spoke so highly of you. It seems you all have some serious talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death power&mdash;you wield some potent energy! Unfortunately for you, it's still not enough to pose a threat in my presence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Emma let out a scoff, her anger palpable. "Is that so? You won't know unless you try! Want to save them? You'll have to get through my Death's Stare first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her finger, the pale eye before her expanded dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every red vein became achingly clear, each one pulsing with a terrifying power that radiated death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death's Beam!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the eye fired off even deadlier beams, slicing through the air toward Maddox, leaving Ricky, Tyrese, and the others pale with dread at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma hadn't even shown her full strength before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Maddox retorted coolly, "You've got guts to come at me like that, but too bad your death power won't faze me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful gesture, he conjured a translucent barrier that enveloped himself and the others like a massive eggshell, crackling with lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beams hammered against the shield, emitting sizzling sounds as the bolts flickered and dimmed before threatening to shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Maddox simply smiled, and the barrier's defenses strengthened, lightning crackling back to life with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit her lip in frustration, pouring all her energy into amplifying her Death's Stare, desperate to break through Maddox's defenses. But it was like throwing punches at a brick wall; nothing she did made a dent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was surrounded by a swirling maelstrom of divine power. It gushed forth like a wild torrent, quickly shoring up the barrier's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment of realization, Emma's complexion turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King! You're seriously an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
