  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, don't do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, panic rising in his chest as he tried to stop her. But his soul hadn't fully healed yet, and he felt utterly powerless. Emma pinned him down on the sandy beach, leaving him with no way to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without warning, Emma's bare body settled onto his waist, and Osborne couldn't help but suck in a sharp breath, feeling a rush of heat course through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's cheeks flushed a deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me not to be reckless, but your body seems pretty eager! It was the one that got carried away first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she ignored his protests, gripping his dick tightly before sinking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma let out a sharp cry, her body going rigid for a moment as a flash of pain crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gasp again, staring at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought this woman was truly wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emma bit her lip, determination etched on her features. As the initial pain subsided, she began to move her hips, awkward but earnest in her efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was Class AAA while he was still recovering from a severe injury to his soul, his strength sapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Osborne could do was let her ride him, completely at her mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't fight it, Osborne decided that he might as well enjoy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Osborne stopped resisting, just like Emma said. What had happened had already happened, and it was still happening. What else could he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he could alter Emma's memories, it wouldn't change the fact that they had crossed that line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma moved with wild abandon, her actions clumsy yet passionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned down occasionally, kissing his neck and lips. Osborne found himself responding, unable to hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his reaction, Emma trembled with excitement, and her movements grew even more fervent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two hours, Osborne's soul had fully healed, and he regained his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Emma was utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh, he scooped her up in his arms, using his water elemental power to conjure a stream of water that washed away their sweat and sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma melted into his embrace, allowing him to clean her up before he dressed her in her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first light of dawn painted the sky with hues of pink and gold, they sat together on a rock, watching the sunrise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma turned to him, a playful smile on her face. "Osborne, you're not mad at me, are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit, I took advantage of you a bit, but don't worry. I'll take responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her a sharp glare, not saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guilt gnawed at him as thoughts of Clarissa flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea how to explain this to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she left, she had warned him not to get involved with any other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne sighed, feeling lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feelings for Emma were complicated, to say the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his sigh, Emma bit her lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Osborne, I know you have a girlfriend. She's beautiful and amazing. You feel guilty about her, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I get it. I won't cling to you! Let's just pretend nothing ever happened between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, now that my Satan's Eye is unlocked, I won't need you anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think of it as a one-time favor, and forget about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma turned her head away from Osborne, gazing off into the distance. Tears glistened in her eyes, but she held her head high, determined not to let them fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed again, "Alright, don't make it sound like I'm some heartless bastard abandoning you. I may not be a great guy, but since it's already happened, I can't pretend like nothing ever did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happens in the future, I can't say. But since you're already my woman, unless you fall for someone else, I'm not going to just ignore you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, brushing off the seriousness of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The selection for the heir isn't over yet. We're still rivals, after all. We should head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes were red-rimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted, saying, "So you're saying that as long as I don't fall for someone else, you won't just leave me hanging?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face lit up with a smile. "Don't worry! I might not know how to love someone properly, but I definitely know how to be loyal. You're the first man for me, and you'll be the only man for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you die, I won't fall for anyone else. No one else will ever touch me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the moment you entered my life, my body, my being, my soul&mdash;they all belong to you alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma spoke with such conviction that Osborne was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, trying to push these thoughts aside, and glanced at his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, his expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><div class="pagination">
