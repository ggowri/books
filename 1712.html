  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's voice echoed, figures began to emerge from the swirling black dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards of the Bowman family, who had been ready to strike, suddenly paled and took a few steps back, their bodies tense with alertness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Microcosm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances but didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As members of the Paramount Supreme Clan's elite guard, they were filled with confidence and pride. Even with Osborne's Dimensional Microcosm at play, they weren't afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, unless a Deity King warrior showed up, they had nothing to fear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a Deity King warrior? There was no way one could be hiding in Osborne's pocket dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first to step out was Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Where are the geniuses from the hundred clans? Finally, I get to take them on! My Trident of Poseidon has been itching for a fight! I'm going to make them roll on the ground begging for mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been cooped up in the Dimensional Microcosm for over twenty years, Bryce, a battle maniac, was practically bursting at the seams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he emerged, his eyes landed on Hannah, and he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another beautiful woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a slightly envious glance at Osborne, thinking, "Why is it that Osborne always has so many gorgeous women around him? This is so unfair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah blinked in surprise, curiously sizing up Bryce. "What do you mean, 'another one'? Are there a lot of pretty women around Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to carry a Dimensional Microcosm with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Celestara, such things were rare and precious, mostly held by the Paramount Supreme Clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even powerful forces like the Gellar family didn't possess one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne had brought out a helper from his Dimensional Microcosm sparked a flicker of hope in Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Is this guy here to help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah studied him, trying to gauge his strength, but it was like trying to see through a fog. Bryce had spent twenty years in the Dimensional Microcosm, and during his boredom, he had learned the Eclipsing Mantra from Mila, mastering it to Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just him</span><span>. </span><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and Kendra had all picked it up, too, each at least at Level Three, with Anastasia having even reached Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in the midst of concealing their energy, it was no wonder Hannah couldn't sense Bryce's true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course there are!" Bryce flashed a grin at Hannah before turning his attention back to the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dozen peak Deity Overlords! Nice! Leave them to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another figure stepped out of the black portal. It was Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Bryce, can you not embarrass yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Bryce's loud boasting, she felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her and shot him a disapproving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned to Hannah and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah mused, "Another one! So beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah couldn't help but admire Kendra, captivated by her stunning face and graceful presence, but she still couldn't sense Kendra's strength or level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A third figure emerged from the black portal</span><span>, </span><span>Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her poised stature, sparkling eyes, and regal aura, Mila instantly drew Hannah's attention, leaving her momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So gorgeous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Zoe and Anastasia stepped out in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twin sisters looked identical, yet each carried a unique charm that left Hannah awestruck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last of them emerged, the black dimensional portal snapped shut behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stood there, dumbfounded, taking in the five newcomers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not one of them could she read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Osborne, her eyes filled with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a warm smile at Hannah and said, "Hannah, let me introduce you. This is Bryce, a true buddy of mine! Next to him is his sister Kendra, and over here is Mila. These two are my sisters, Zoe and Anastasia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of them nodded at Hannah in unison, each taking a moment to assess her just as she was taking in their appearances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they were curious about the person who had prompted Osborne to rush to her rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they appraised Hannah, comprehension dawned on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Hannah's striking beauty, they exchanged knowing, somewhat teasing glances aimed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed under their scrutiny, Osborne waved his hands dismissively. "What's with those looks? Hannah is my friend! Plus, she's from the Mystic Feather Clan, which is one of the friendliest races toward the Human Community in Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia chuckled. "We get it, Osborne; you don't need to explain yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't tell Isa or Clarissa about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Osborne's face darkened, and he reached out to give her a playful slap on the back of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold voice cut through the light-hearted banter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you all finished your little chat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If so, it's time for you to head to hell!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
