Everett asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather replied calmly, "I mean nothing else. I just think that if you are going to convict him, you should first investigate the facts before making a decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett snorted, "What's there to investigate? He's using light elemental power. You can't possibly be blind to it! I see no need for an investigation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest you investigate anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather responded coldly, "In any case, until the matter is thoroughly investigated, I will not let you take him. If we truly can't reach an agreement, then we will have no choice but to go to war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand we are no match for the League of Divine Descent, but I'm confident I can take down a few of your Class S Supreme Overlords with me! And then, we'll see which one of you will be sent to meet your gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Everett's face darkened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you're courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather fearlessly held Everett's gaze firmly without a hint of concession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were sharp as a sword at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was shocked to realize that he couldn't even look Godfather in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted again and said, "Fine, if you want me to investigate, then I'll investigate. It won't waste much time anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Everett turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked coldly, "Tell me, how did you come by your light elemental power? Light elemental power is a Divine Power that only members of the Divine Descent can get. No one in the Augustine family has ever naturally gotten it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, you must have used the Augustine family's Satan's Eye to absorb someone's light elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt deeply grateful that Godfather hadn't handed him over to Everett for execution, but Godfather's words left him puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Godfather didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with him possessing light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Godfather seemed confident that he wouldn't be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, filled with confusion, decided not to lie in response to Everett's questioning. He knew that lying was pointless in front of someone like Everett, a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered calmly, "Yes, I did use the Satan's Eye to absorb the light elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he spoken than a commotion broke out among the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Osborne to admit it so readily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all thought it was over for him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sneered, "Good, so you admit it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned back to Godfather and said coldly, "Sebastian, what do you have to say now? He has confessed to blaspheming the gods, and you can't protect him any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather remained composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should ask a more specific question, such as how he obtained the light elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Godfather spoke to Osborne, "Osborne, just answer truthfully. Tell him who gave you the light elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, thinking, "Godfather wants me to tell Everett who gave him the light elemental essence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was also confused, his voice cold. "Sebastian, what game are you playing? Even if someone else gave him the light elemental essence, absorbing it is still an unforgivable crime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled, "Maybe it does have a point. It won't waste much time, just one more question. Once you know the answer, if you still want to take him to the Mount of Gods for execution, I won't stop you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's expression changed his brow furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, he snorted and said coldly to Osborne, "Tell me, how did you get the light elemental essence? Or rather, who gave it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Godfather and saw an encouraging look in his eyes, so he took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered calmly, "My girlfriend gave it to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was stunned. "Your girlfriend gave it to you? Ha, then she too must die! Tell me her name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, unwilling to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried that revealing her name would put Isa at risk. From the murmurs of the Augustine family members, he had now understood the immense power of the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea how Isa had obtained the light elemental essence, but he suspected she might have killed someone from the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "If I tell him about Isa, will the League of Divine Descent let her go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Isa is powerful, she can't possibly stand against the League of Divine Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to betray Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't worry, just say her name out loud. I guarantee she won't be harmed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Godfather spoke up suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne still frowned, worried that Godfather might push the blame onto Isa to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, even if he survived, he could never forgive himself or Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, still refusing to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sneered, "It seems you don't want to say it. But even if you don't, we, the League of Divine Descent, can still find out! And when we do, she will still die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze suddenly became fierce. "If you dare to harm her, I will kill you! I will slaughter every last one of you in the League of Divine Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett burst into laughter, and his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next second, his eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot. How dare you threaten me? Since you won't speak, you can die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett suddenly struck, his palm slamming toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt as if the sky was falling!</span></p><div class="pagination">
