  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the momentum and confidence return to his team, Apocalypse Harbinger couldn't help but smile with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered at Osborne and said, "Well done! Not only are you personally powerful, but you've also managed to cultivate such a formidable force. If you're willing to bow down to Lord Malevolence, I'm sure the master would reward you handsomely. With a little time, you could rise to a high position within the Dark Deity Legion, far surpassing my own status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> here's your last chance: surrender to Lord Malevolence and serve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your only shot at survival, and it could pave the way for a bright future! Once Lord Malevolence obliterates the resistance and claims dominion over </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, you shall receive an expansive fiefdom and perhaps even ascend to the highest echelons of the human race!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I advise you not to resist. With your five thousand Intermediate Deities, you might sweep away all the major powers on Blue Planet, but you'll have no chance against my Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention, I have the Pantheon League and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization backing me. Trust me, your Intermediate Deities won't last long against us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with menace as he finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but let out a laugh. "You really love to talk, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's amusing that you still think you can sway me at a time like this. Unfortunately for you, my backbone is too strong! I'd much rather take down Lord Malevolence than be his slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's skip the pleasantries and jump right into battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, you'll understand whether or not these five thousand Intermediate Deities can stand against over a thousand Superior and Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all will perish right here! I will wipe you out for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be the final showdown on Blue Planet. After today, the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization will be no more. Peace will return, and </span><span>the Augustine family will reign again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fierce determination sparkling in his eyes, Osborne felt his power surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger seethed with anger. "How arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can wipe us out? You'll regret that! Since you're so blind to your own limits, don't blame me for what happens next! Attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminate them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the coalition sprang into action once more, each member inflamed with rage over Osborne's insolence. They launched an all-out assault on the Blood Demon members without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the Blood Demon members stood resolute, unyielding in their unity. The air crackled as their combined energy surged, forming a massive spherical shield of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacks from the coalition&mdash;over a thousand Superior and Transcendent Deity warriors&mdash;rained down from all sides, slamming into the divine power shield and causing it to ripple violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scrutinized the coalition's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over one hundred and fifty Transcendent Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a thousand Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force they wielded was undeniably formidable. Under normal circumstances, even an army of 10 thousand ordinary Intermediate Deities wouldn't stand a chance against such might if they weren't coordinated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Blood Demon members were not average, ordinary fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were well-trained and harmoniously synchronized; their formations honed through countless bloody battles. Although the attacks from the coalition were fearsome, they weren't enough to breach the combined defenses of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of attacks poured in, causing the massive divine power shield to shimmer violently, appearing on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, with each onslaught, it held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly five thousand Blood Demon members constantly fueled the shield with their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being bombarded by over a thousand Superior and Transcendent Deities for several rounds, the Blood Demon members remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left the allied forces in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Apocalypse Harbinger was astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Just five thousand Intermediate Deities? How could they withstand the relentless barrage of one hundred fifty Transcendent Deities and one thousand Superior Deities? They should have been pulverized by now! This defies logic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger's face darkened. A mid-level officer in the Dark Deity Legion, he had served under Lord Malevolence for countless years, fighting in innumerable battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had he encountered such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had he seen an enemy so seamlessly coordinated, the five thousand Blood </span><span>Demon members acting as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving his hand, Apocalypse Harbinger halted the attacks, his mind racing for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sneer. "Done already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're tapped out, then it's our turn to strike back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger retorted with disdain, "Strike back? Laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that you've managed to fend off our attacks is miraculous enough. Dream on if you think you can counterattack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Oh, really? Let's see then! Counterattack!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
