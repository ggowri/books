  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process of advancing one's cultivation level was never instantaneous; it was a gradual journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Sacred Crystals, the Infinite Devouring Eyes could only absorb energy from ordinary Celestial Crystals or fragments of the World Tree, aiding Osborne's cultivation in a slow, steady manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was akin to a small stream flowing into a vast lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the stream filled the lake, Osborne's cultivation level would eventually rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this process was incredibly time-consuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne required an astronomical amount of energy to elevate his cultivation level&mdash;hundreds of times more than his peers. His lake was simply much larger than theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Infinite Devouring Eyes providing a constant flow of energy, filling that lake would still take ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Sacred Crystals in hand, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy contained within Sacred Crystals was not only exceptionally high-grade but also incredibly pure. Even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could use them to enhance their cultivation level. For Osborne, who was only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, utilizing these crystals was like upgrading from a small stream to a roaring river a thousand times its size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne's lake was vast, the surging river rapidly filled it to the brim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt a powerful vibration surge through him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level hit its limit and then broke through, reaching a new height&mdash;Ascension Two Supernal Deity King level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the Infinite Devouring Eyes voraciously consumed the energy from the Sacred Crystals, propelling Osborne's cultivation level from Ascension One to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though he had undergone a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine power within him expanded significantly, becoming more refined and potent, enhancing his overall strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes continued their relentless absorption of energy, flooding his divine power reservoir and pushing him toward Ascension Three Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally broke through!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with excitement as he opened them wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda gasped in surprise, "Wait, what?! Osborne, did you just break through your cultivation level? You feel different&mdash;are you really Ascension Two now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, a sense of relief washing over him. "Yes! I've finally reached Ascension Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a weight lift off his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had he left Celestara, ventured into deep space, and navigated the dangers of Umbra Earth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all to accelerate his cultivation level and enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the Human Community in Celestara was facing dire threats. In less than a month, the formidable Paramount Supreme Clan would lead the Dark Deity Legion in a full-scale war against the Human Community in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lord Malevolence would likely join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current strength of the Human Community was insufficient to withstand such an onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Lord Malevolence chose not to intervene, they wouldn't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't bear the thought of witnessing the Human Community get slaughtered or suffering heavy casualties in the impending war. He was determined to change the course of this conflict, to end it before it began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his cultivation level and strength were too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to break through to Ascension Four&mdash;or even higher&mdash;within a month to have any hope of altering the fate of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, achieving such a rapid ascent seemed nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, the pressure weighing on Osborne had been immense; he lacked confidence in his ability to make swift progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with his breakthrough to Ascension Two, that burden had lifted significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that only a fraction of the power from the twelve Sacred Crystals had been consumed. Once he absorbed them fully, even if he couldn't break through to Ascension Four, he would undoubtedly reach the peak of Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they were in Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two days, he had found twelve Sacred Crystals, and he was confident he would discover even more in the days to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Four? That was within his reach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had every opportunity to achieve an even higher cultivation level within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, determination shining in his eyes, "Just wait and see!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I return to Celestara, it'll be the end of the war between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community! I, Osborne, will personally put an end to this conflict that has lasted for over a thousand years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence, you better watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished his thoughts, Osborne turned to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could speak, his expression suddenly shifted, darkening with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?!" Alfreda asked, her voice laced with worry as she noticed the change in his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, his silence heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had broken through to a new cultivation level, his </span><span>C</span><span>lone </span><span>T</span><span>wenty-</span><span>Five </span><span>had found twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals in a branch of the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, among those were seven Spatial Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial Gold Crystals were incredibly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two days, Osborne's clones had found nearly five hundred Element Gold Crystals. Among these, Spatial Gold Crystals were the rarest, second only to Time Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the five hundred Element Gold Crystals, there were only eleven Spatial Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Clone Twenty-Five had discovered seven Spatial Gold Crystals in a single location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those seven, plus the eleven he already had, he felt confident that he could push his space elemental essence beyond its limits and reach Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the clone was about to collect the Element Gold Crystals, disaster struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long, spiky vine shot up from the ground with lightning speed, piercing through the unprepared clone's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the clone had about seventy percent of Osborne's attack power, its defense was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vine easily pierced through, swiftly draining the clone's divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clone was killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it perished, it caught a glimpse of another exploration team slowly approaching from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a Soulreaver Vine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was right, the vine that had just slain his clone was indeed a Soulreaver Vine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having over two hundred clones exploring the Death Chasm for two days, he had avoided encountering one&mdash;until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven Spatial Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't let this slip away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a Soulreaver Vine guarding the spot, I have to get my hands on those Spatial Gold Crystals! But it looks like another exploration team has its sights set on them too. They must have already discovered those Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just hope the Soulreaver Vine can hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he contemplated this, he glanced at Alfreda, who was watching him with concern etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on? You look terrible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he spoke up, "Alfreda, I've found a location with Element Gold Crystals&mdash;twenty-eight of them! But there's a Soulreaver Vine guarding the area. Plus, another exploration team is closing in on those crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm planning to head over and see if I can snag them. If you're not up for the risk, you can wait here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened in disbelief. "What? Twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know where they are? We absolutely have to go after them! Let's move, now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals are ours for the taking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to get in our way will regret it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
