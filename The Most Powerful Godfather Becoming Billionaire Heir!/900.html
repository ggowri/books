        <h1>Chapter 900 Don't Be Smug</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma growled, "Everyone, shut up! Hazel might be in danger. If anyone dares to talk nonsense or gloat, he'll be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Eamonn fiercely. If this guy insisted on provoking her, he must be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, in addition to worrying about Hazel, she was also apprehensive about Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't come back all night, and she didn't know what happened to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning that Hazel was missing, she temporarily put aside the fact that Alexander had not returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn narrowed his eyes. "It's wrong for you to say that. We just care about Hazel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted at Norma, his malicious gaze wandering around her with an evil smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma felt his obscene gaze, which was falling on her plump breasts. This guy really deserved to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma slammed the desk and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn smiled disdainfully and was about to start scolding her when suddenly a pleasant male voice came from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is so bold as to bully even family head and the gang leader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this extremely familiar voice, Norma immediately cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked quickly into the hall, and Norma immediately rushed into his arms and hugged him tightly like a cute puppy welcoming its owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as her master was around, Norma felt extremely safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene shocked everyone, but no one said anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene of Alexander killing Sean was still vivid in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Norma's back gently and looked at Eamonn with a cold gaze. "Were you the one who bullied Norma just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn snorted coldly. He came here well prepared today and had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, an outsider, have no right to interfere in our family's internal affairs! You killed Sean, and we haven't settled the scored yet... Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his words, he was slapped hard by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn was on the ground, his cheeks swollen and burning with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped on his right hand and crushed it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to settle the scores with me? Why don't you open your eyes and see who I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn screamed desperately and tried to pull his hand out but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of crisp sounds of breaking finger bones were heard, and Eamonn fainted from the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the Walsh family took several steps back in fear, with dark expressions as if they had seen a fierce ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare a loser like you question Norma!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered with contempt, kicked Eamonn several feet away, and then sat down in the middle position with a swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma sat beside him obediently, handing him cigarettes and lighting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the leader of the Dragon Gang and the head of the Walsh Family was actually a little girl who served others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander crossed his legs, took a leisurely puff of his cigarette, and blew out smoke rings. His relaxed and leisurely look almost drove Eamonn crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamonn covered his twisted hand and snarled, "Don't be smug. Just wait. Not only will Norma lose the position of the family head, but she will also lose the position of the gang leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already reached an agreement on cooperation with Mr. Locke Welsh of the Mafia. We will form a powerful alliance and the positions of the family head and gang leader will be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words were spoken, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Eamonn had the support of the Mafia, which was why he was so arrogant in targeting Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander and Norma, wondering their reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, as Vivian had explained everything to him before he came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke did reach an offensive and defensive alliance with Eamonn, with the original intention of fostering a puppet to control the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Eamonn never expected was that Locke was dead last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma pointed at Eamonn and angrily shouted, "How dare you collude with the Mafia to threaten me? Do you know that the Mafia is ruthless? Do you think they will really help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped her, and his following words surprised everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dragon Gang and the Mafia can indeed unite to gain greater benefits!"</span></p></div>
