        <h1>Chapter 1321 Assessment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander's golden energy was extraordinary. His Force could absorb the metallic energy from the world to strengthen himself. Though he hadn't tested himself against others, ordinary blades already struggled to cut through his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that the strength of his muscles was definitely not something that ordinary level-two warriors could compare to, and this was his greatest advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Alexander didn't know was that the ancient martial manuals recorded that even a prodigy would take at least two years to reach level-one warrior. However, there were no clear records on how long it would take to advance from level one to level two, as mastering the balance of hardness and softness required a minimum of three years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander had only been at level-one warrior for three months and was already on the verge of breaking through. He was a genius among geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it wasn't surprising. The mysterious golden energy, Spiritual Awakening, Muscle-Tendon Classic, the Rejuvenation Pill, 24-posture Harmonic Fist, and Vardaanian Yoga were all extraordinary foundations, and together, they had forged something beyond genius. Perhaps calling Alexander a monster would be more accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan groaned in frustration, "Alex, I'll need months just to reach level-one warrior at this rate! How is it that we both got the Spiritual Awakening from Father Hezekiah and trained in Muscle-Tendon Classic, yet the gap between us is this huge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted Logan on the shoulder and comforted him. "Don't worry. Even when I go to the Outer Court, I still have your back. And after I leave, who else would take over as boss around here if not you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, carefree as ever, brightened up instantly. "That's right, I'm the one who planted the Melon King! Who dares question my authority?" Then, he laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the break of dawn, Alexander and Logan were already up and on their way to the Dominion Church's Outer Court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Outer Court was grand and imposing, its yellow walls and red-tiled roofs stretching endlessly into the distance. Towering ancient trees surrounded the area, their lush green canopy casting cool shadows over the grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the top of a 48-step high majestic staircase stood a pair of lion statues. Their fierce expressions frozen in time as they played with carved spheres beneath their paws. Above the grand crimson archway, the words "Outer Court" were inscribed in bold, commanding strokes that seemed to carry an undeniable power, striking straight into the hearts of those who gazed upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Outer Court was where lay disciples of the Dominion Church practiced and lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast square before the Outer Court was already packed with young hopefuls. Some were clad in luxurious robes, accompanied by servants and guards. Others wore short, fitted attire of martial artists, their gazes sharp and determined. A few donned battle armor, clearly soldiers from the Hrodvik military. Among them were both men and women, all gathered to participate in the entrance examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The empire was vast, its population numbering in the hundreds of millions. Nobles, ministers, merchants, craftsmen, farmers... people from all walks of life dreamed of rising above their station. And for many, entering Dominion Church was the best way to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mastering the Church's martial arts meant a chance to become a level-five warrior, earning noble titles and high-ranking military positions. Even reaching level three would guarantee a life free from worries, as powerful families eagerly sought to hire level-three warriors at great cost. As for level-four and level-five warriors, no amount of silver could buy their loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every five years, Dominion Church held an entrance examination, open only to those under 25 who had already reached level-one warrior. The reasoning was simple. Youthful vigor and sharp minds had the best chance of reaching greater heights. Once a person reached middle age, their life force would begin to wane, making the dream of becoming a level-five warrior nothing more than a fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many people, all at least level-one warriors. I have no idea how many are stronger than me or weaker." Alexander stroked his chin, feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew very little about the Dominion Church's Outer Court examination. The people at Emerald Manor were all helpers, and there had been no way to gather information. So he listened carefully to the discussions of the people next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man dressed in a luxurious suit shook his head and said pretentiously, "I heard that the Dominion Church's St. Paul's Marrow-Cleansing Classic is the most powerful martial art for level-four warriors. This time, I must get my hands on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged follower beside the young man responded, "It's a pity that the St. Paul's Muscle-Tendon Classic has been lost for many years. Otherwise, combining the two classics, one could ascend to the level-five warrior in record time and even dominate the entire realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, a group of young men in simple blue training attire were deep in discussion, their voices overlapping in excitement and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that the Outer Court assessment is not easy to pass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! That Thunderclap Bronze Men is rumored to be incredibly powerful and agile and has inexhaustible stamina. Moreover, it is as hard as a diamond and invulnerable to blades and spears. Compared to a level-three warrior, it is not inferior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we better be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thunderclap Bronze Men? What are those? That sounds like something I should watch out for. If I fail to get into the Outer Court, the next chance won't come for another five years..." Alexander became secretly vigilant as he listened to these prominent young men's discussions.</span></p></div>
