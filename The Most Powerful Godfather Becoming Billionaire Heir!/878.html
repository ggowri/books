        <h1>Chapter 878 They're Back</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Splash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave shot into the sky as Alexander burst out of the water, holding Norma tightly. With his right hand, he grabbed the yacht's ladder and leaped onto the deck without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same moment, a tiger shark lunged out of the water, its jaws wide open. But it was too late. It crashed back into the ocean, sending water spraying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scared me to death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma clung tightly to Alexander, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne! Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendants waiting anxiously on the deck let out a collective sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver, however, looked pale. He had never expected Alexander to leap back onto the boat. It was impressive, to say the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Splash, splash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the water, a frenzy of tiger sharks thrashed about, tearing into the corpse of their own kind, churning the sea into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding waters turned crimson, drawing even more tiger sharks from the distance to join the gruesome feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you pick this spot? Were you trying to kill us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma was furious. She slapped the driver hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver held his face and stayed silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the slap, Norma was ready to let it go, but Alexander grabbed the driver by his collar and yanked him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be honest. Who told you to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver's face twisted, and he stammered in protest, "Alexander, no one told me to! I didn't know there were tiger sharks in this area. I'm so sorry, really sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Not talking? Fine. Let's feed you to the sharks, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hauled the driver to the edge of the boat, holding him over the surging waves below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Alexander, I was wrong... I know I was wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me who's behind this. If you don't, you're shark bait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver turned pale as he stammered, "I... I work for the Sakra Society. Mr. White ordered it. He wanted to eliminate Norma while the Dragon Gang was unstable, so we could take over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma was livid. She hadn't expected the Sakra Society to be behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even gone after them yet, and here they were causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver looked at the sharks circling below and was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne... I've told you everything. Can you... can you let me go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "Sure, I'll keep my word and let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relief on the driver's face froze as he fell straight into the throng of sharks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams pierced the air as several sharks tore him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma seethed. "Those despicable Sakra Society scum. We have to wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this ordeal, both Norma and Alexander lost interest in continuing their outing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht carrying Norma and Alexander began its return trip. Meanwhile, a group of burly men had gathered at the dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were members of the Sakra Society, summoned by Matteo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Matteo's father was a high-ranking member of the Sakra Society, giving the Hunter family a solid position within the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group had been waiting for hours, their sole purpose to help Matteo get revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matteo, don't worry. It's almost evening; they'll be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we've set up a trap at the dock. That girl will definitely be ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for that punk who dared lay hands on us, we'll break his arms and legs and feed him to the fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter, you're the man. With the Sakra Society backing you, the rest of us can't even compare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matteo's hangers-on flattered him, and his sour expression lightened a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spots where Alexander had beaten him still ached; even the slightest movement was painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to settle this score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here! I see them&mdash;they're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with binoculars shouted excitedly. In the distance, a luxury yacht was speeding toward the dock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the massive yacht, some of Matteo's followers looked uneasy and asked nervously, "Mr. Hunter, a yacht like that must cost over a hundred million dollars, right? Someone who can afford something this high-end isn't just anyone."</span></p></div>
