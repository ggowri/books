        <h1>Chapter 1171 Terrifying Power</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you needed to be careful. They had several people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn, ignoring the danger, desperately reminded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid. No matter how many of them there are, I will get you out safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reassured </span><span>Lynn,</span><span> his cold gaze firmly locked on the man in black. As long as that man dared to make a move, Alexander would unleash the Force and take him down with one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for worrying about Lynn getting hurt, that man would have already been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly said, "I took Stephen down with a single blow. Do you want to end up like him? Release Lynn and I can spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible. Although Stephen was Test Subject Number One and had many imperfections, he could never be taken down by you in one hit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black scoffed at Alexander's ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I know you have some skill, but why did you choose to oppose the Sakra Society?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our president said he could give you one last chance. As long as you hand over the magic powder formula and join the Sakra Society, not only </span><span>will</span><span> </span><span>we let you go, but we </span><span>will</span><span> </span><span>also guarantee you eternal life and riches."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems my magic powder played an important role in your experiments, didn't it? Test Subject Number One? Quite interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was laughing, he felt a weight in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society's research on the Immortality Serum had become increasingly in-depth. They had already begun to mass-produce strong individuals like Stephen, which was a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black knew he wouldn't easily obtain the magic powder formula today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip on the sword and coldly said, "Hand over the magic powder formula, or I will kill this woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man in black threatened, he pretended to swing the saber towards Lynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Alexander made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force, which he had stored for a long time, erupted, propelling him forward with an uncanny pace until he stood right in front of the man in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black screamed in fear. He never expected Alexander to be so fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't see or keep up with Alexander's movements as if Alexander had always been standing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black tried to escape, but Alexander swiftly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" The man in black shouted in terror, wildly swinging his saber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, soft lightsabers ignited and collided with the saber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black's sword broke in half like paper, and he quickly rolled to the ground in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood flowed from his back. He ultimately failed to evade Alexander's strike completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the man in black miraculously escaped death. With a large chunk of flesh missing from his back and blood soaking him, he trembled all over, his previous confidence completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had to fight desperately now, so he shouted with a twisted expression, "Number Three, Number Four, Number Five, why aren't you coming out to fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several dark shadows moved outside the cave. They were all test subjects from the Sakra Society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene filled Lynn with fear, and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even have a chance to fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce glint flashed in Alexander's eyes. He saw very clearly that one of the shadows was carrying a rocket launcher, intending to collapse the cave and bury Alexander alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for death." Alexander threw his lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brilliant white light flashed, and the unfortunate one with the rocket launcher couldn't react in time before both he and the launcher were cut in half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander kicked the ground, sending a flurry of stones flying. Those stones, propelled by the Force, shot toward the remaining two dark figures like cannonballs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sound of continuous piercing through flesh. The two men in black were riddled with holes, and before they could attack Alexander, they collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in black inside the cave spat out a mouthful of blood, his face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged toward Lynn like a madman. He knew that controlling Lynn was his only chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Alexander to be so powerful, truly capable of taking them down in an instant, especially since each of them had strength comparable to or exceeding Stephen's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in front of Alexander, they felt like insignificant trash.</span></p></div>
