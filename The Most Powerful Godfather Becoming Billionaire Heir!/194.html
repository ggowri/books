        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undoubtedly, the Federer family was out in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was indeed cunning; after failing to kidnap Ava, he quickly gathered men for an assault&mdash;true villain behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce light flashed in Alexander's eyes as he clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the convoy stopped about </span><span>300 feet</span><span> away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred people jumped out of the cars</span><span> into the rain</span><span>, armed with various weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain pelted their faces and drenched them, yet no one sought shelter or made a fuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, these people were well-trained elite forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly formed a line and advanced toward the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a wealthy area, and there should be tight security, but there was no warning&mdash;clearly, the Federer family had taken care of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, every move they made, even with the cover of darkness and rain, was clearly visible to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A freckled-faced guy</span><span>, </span><span>Chris Federer</span><span>,</span><span> in the front said excitedly, "It's the villa right ahead! Ava sent </span><span>it to</span><span> Alexander. According to our intel, she came here after running away. If we capture her and Alexander, </span><span>there must be a huge bonus from </span><span>the master</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another guy with a hooked nose </span><span>and tanned skin </span><span>looked serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chris, the master </span><span>wanted us to be careful</span><span>. Even the old butler lost to Alexander; that guy shouldn't be underestimated. If anything goes wrong, we retreat immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The freckled-faced rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edward, you're just too timid. We have over a hundred people, plus you, the Federer family's top </span><span>fighter</span><span>. </span><span>How can we fail</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward Federer stroked his hooked nose and replied, "</span><span>In normal cases</span><span>, we're well-prepared for</span><span> a sudden attack</span><span>, so Alexander and Ava definitely won't escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, the Fraternity just clashed with the Ultimate Alliance. After we capture Alexander and Ava, everyone will think it was the Fraternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris' freckled face was almost twisted with excitement as he nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! The master has a brilliant plan. Our </span><span>action</span><span> will surely succeed! Even if Alexander is strong, we have so many people</span><span> to defeat him</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Edward's expression changed, and he hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around anxiously, </span><span>and had </span><span>an ominous</span><span> </span><span>feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the storm, everything was pitch black, and he couldn't see anything clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he was just overthinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward forced a smile, then patted his chest to bolster his spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pass the orders: </span><span>anyone except</span><span> Ava and Alexander must be killed without mercy&mdash;no witnesses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He issued the command ruthlessly, his tone devoid of any human emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Edward didn't realize that Alexander heard their entire conversation loud and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward </span><span>could never have imagined that </span><span>there was something like</span><span> Legendary Warrior in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander was just a Novice Warrior, the power of The Force was beyond Edward's imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every detail </span><span>captured by</span><span> Alexander, and </span><span>he showed </span><span>a wicked smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're here, </span><span>then stay here forever</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He commanded Augusta that once </span><span>he</span><span> made a move, they needed to surround the scene and not let anyone escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were going to act, they had to root out every last one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Alexander learned he was the Godfather's heir and became a Warrior, he was no longer </span><span>the</span><span> weak man</span><span> he was in the past</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vowed to protect his family and become powerful, looking down on all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary </span><span>must</span><span> die, and the Federer family must fall apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To protect family ties, love, and friendship, and for all the brothers of the Ultimate Alliance, this massacre today is </span><span>inevitable</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's heavy rain has come just in time; with Alexander's incredible perception, the pitch-black </span><span>rainy</span><span> night is his perfect stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, like a ghost, quietly faded into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder roared, and torrential rain poured down from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a hundred members of the Federer family charged forward aggressively, led by elite members</span><span>,</span><span> Chris and Edward.</span></p></div>
