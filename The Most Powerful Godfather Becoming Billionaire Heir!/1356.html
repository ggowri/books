        <h1>Chapter 1356 Fearless</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bustling slave market, where merchants thrived and buyers flocked, a vibrant marketplace had emerged at the entrance, selling all kinds of wares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, chaos erupted in the crowd, accompanied by a loud shout. "How dare you set up shop here without paying me a protection fee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly man with a fierce demeanor, flanked by five or six goons, confronted a stall selling animal skins and food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brown-haired, blue-eyed man in his thirties stood there, coins in hand, apologizing. "Mr. Monroe, this is our monthly fee. We just need a little time to display our goods before we leave. Please, have mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald giant next to him, towering at 6.5 feet, began to roll up his bedding and pack away the wares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scoundrel! Is that all you have? Hand over 100 coins, and I'll let you go!" Dexter Monroe barked, waving his hand as his goons surrounded the two men. One even attempted to snatch the white tiger skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you looking for trouble?" the bald giant roared, swinging his massive arms. Dexter's lackeys stumbled back, unable to withstand the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Dexter's face trembled with anger as he drew a finely crafted steel dagger, ready to stab the giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the brown-haired man seized Dexter's arm. "Mr. Monroe, it's always been 10 coins. Your demand is outrageous this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter's face flushed red as he struggled against the grip, his rage morphing into a mocking laugh. "Begeta, you don't think I know your background?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock flickered across Begeta's face, but his grip started to loosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce effort, Dexter broke free and sprinted into the crowd, shouting, "Folks, since these two bastards are looking for trouble, let's go fetch the officers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goons scattered, disappearing into the throng at his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vegeta?" Alexander and Logan exchanged stunned glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, the two men began to pack up their goods, eager to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vegeta, are you a Saiyan?" Alexander and Logan rushed over, blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Begeta frowned and saluted like a Hrodvik. "Sir, I'm Begeta, not Vegeta. I'm from Noah Continent. We really must leave. Please, step aside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan couldn't resist asking, "What's your current combat power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald giant next to Begeta had had enough and pushed Logan aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Nova!" Begeta roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fuming from the reprimand, Nova stepped back and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged knowing looks before chiming in unison, "And you still claim you're not Vegeta!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another commotion arose at the far end of the street. Dexter appeared, leading a group of menacing policemen wielding iron shackles and chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head officer raised his iron chain and shouted, "Where's the murderous slave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They advanced, intent on capturing Begeta. Begeta and Nova paled, realizing they were about to be arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Alexander shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan sprang forward, blocking the police's advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer narrowed his eyes, sneering as he appraised Alexander and his companions, noting their tattered attire. "You're not afraid to die? Dare to resist arrest? Kye, fire the signal cannon to alert the camp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kye pulled a tube from his robe, ready to blow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you dare!" Enoch shouted, his subordinates stepping forward with scorn. "Do you know who you're dealing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police felt a flicker of unease; there was something about these men. But even if they had some influence, they couldn't possibly rival Dexter's brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" the officer asked, raising his chin defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enoch's subordinate was livid, jumping up and down as he pointed at the officer's nose. "They're the Earl and the master from the Ministry of Defense! You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer gasped, his iron chain trembling in his grip. He hesitated, preparing to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter, watching the scene unfold, sensed the shift. A cruel glint appeared in his eyes as he saluted and declared, "Greetings. These two slaves have killed over 10 merchants and their guards. They lack Hrodvik household registration, and I suspect they might be spies from Noah Continent. According to Hrodvik law, they deserve execution!"</span></p></div>
