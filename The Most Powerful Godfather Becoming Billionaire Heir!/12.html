        <h1>Chapter 12 Favor</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne scoffed with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good. If you dare offend me again, consider your life forfeit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan, knowing she was likely watching him through binoculars, immediately dropped to his knees and apologized repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was wrong! I sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne cut him off impatiently. "Enough! Useless thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The new chairman thinks highly of you. You will be appointed as Vice President of the Saint Group. Here's the first invitation to the ball. You and Jane should get ready to attend together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Anne hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell deathly silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan was dumbfounded, utterly unable to believe what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't believe such good fortune had fallen into his lap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The position of Vice President of the Saint Group was suddenly his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane screamed in delight, shouting excitedly like a mad woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Darling, you're amazing! I knew I made the right choice! I should've divorced Alexander sooner!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a servant rushed to the door, flustered. The Saint Group had really delivered the ball invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan held the gilded invitation with trembling hands, his entire body shaking with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, the invitation had both his and Jane's names written on it, using extremely respectful language. Even more astonishing, the invitation bore the number "1".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan burst into wild laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've gained the chairman's favor! I'm going to be the Vice President of the Saint Group! I'm going to be the Vice President of the Saint Group..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only Ryan but Jane and everyone else in the room were so excited that they could hardly form coherent sentences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan's face flushed with excitement as he shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Notify all the Hawkins family business partners! Tell them I'm about to become the Vice President of the Saint Group, and this invitation is proof.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell them they'd better give the Hawkins family a 20% discount, or else, once I become VP, they'll regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone nearby cautiously reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hawkins, if we use the Saint Group to pressure them, won't that cause an uproar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan sneered dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who would dare get angry? Ridiculous. With the Saint Group backing me, they'll be begging me for favors. They wouldn't dream of crossing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane quickly chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly! My fianc&eacute; is going to be a big shot, living in Bevery Hills. Who would dare offend us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan gave Jane a half-hearted smile, but in his mind, he was still thinking about Ava's seductive figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Alexander, you don't deserve a beauty like her. She's mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, a piece of explosive news shook the entire high society of Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan of the Hawkins family had been handpicked by the new chairman of the Saint Group to be the next Vice President. He had already received the first invitation to the ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To the true elites, most of whom had never heard of the Hawkins family or Ryan, this came as a surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon investigation, they found that the Hawkins family was merely a small family whose assets had just barely crossed the billion dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But they knew that if Ryan had gained the favor of the Saint Group's chairman, he was bound to rise meteorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the Saint Group's influence, Ryan was someone worth currying favor with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, these influential figures began sending gifts to the Hawkins family, trying to establish a connection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Hawkins family's dozen or so business partners were in a state of panic, feeling as if the end was near.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ryan had openly torn up their contracts, demanding a 20% discount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they complied, they would not only make no profit but even lose money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if they refused, once Ryan became Vice President, they would be forced out of business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With no choice left, they begin preparing lavish gifts and go to meet Ryan to plead for mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, the previously obscure Hawkins family became the most sought-after new power in Loscity, with their doors flooded by visitors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, no one was more worried than Alexander's aunt, Lily Beaumont.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's mother had passed away shortly after giving birth to him, and it was Lily who had raised him with great effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she learned that Jane had forced Alexander to divorce and that Ryan was about to become the Vice President of the Saint Group, Lily was truly shaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overnight, she had grown noticeably more haggard, her hair turning completely gray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily tried calling Alexander to understand the situation, but Alexander was meditating and had put his phone on silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to reach him, Lily grew even more anxious and quickly prepared a gift to go and plead with Jane, hoping that she and Ryan wouldn't target Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, let me in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily forced a smile at the security guard at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane was standing on the steps, clinging to Ryan's arm, greeting the various distinguished guests who had come bearing gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Lily appear, Jane's smile instantly vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing here?" she asked coldly.</p></div>
