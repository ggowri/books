        <h1>Chapter 1379 The Hidden Chamber</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed from Adonis's mouth as his massive body crashed to the ground like a fallen titan, shaking the earth with a thunderous&nbsp;boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the flurry of battle, three men collapsed, unable to rise&mdash;only Alexander remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bandits inside the Sacred Spirit Gang saw their two leaders defeated and instantly lost their will to fight. One by one, they threw down their weapons and fell to their knees in surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rushed to Josh, pulled out a&nbsp;Docpirin pill, and handed it to Ivan to feed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he joined Logan and the others, leading them in a triumphant shout.&nbsp;"The Risunese are dead! The Risunese are dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gates of the fort swung open, and they charged out in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the fort, over a thousand bandits heard the shouts. Seeing the gates wide open and the warriors of Tiger Gang charging out, led by two towering, unstoppable fighters, they were thrown into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their two&nbsp;level-four warrior&nbsp;leaders nowhere in sight&mdash;most likely dead&mdash;some bandits dropped to their knees, begging for mercy. Others stood frozen in confusion, while some turned and bolted down the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, after the battlefield was cleared, the group gathered in the fort's council hall to discuss their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had yielded one captive&mdash;Klein Hemsworth&mdash;and one dead&mdash;Adonis. The narrow mountain paths had made escape difficult. Over 500 of the Sacred Spirit Gang's bandits had been captured, 300 had been killed, and around 100 had managed to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp glint flashed in Alexander's eyes as he spoke coldly, "Keep a close watch on the Risunese prisoners and Klein. Don't let them escape! Speed is key&mdash;we'll strike the Sacred Spirit Gang next. Logan and I will lead the charge. Ivan, stay here and take care of your father. Defend the fort well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ivan nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan gathered over a hundred fighters, taking several prisoners as guides, and set off toward the Sacred Spirit Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, they arrived at the Sacred Spirit Gang, which was built within a valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides. A single narrow gorge served as the only entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gorge was packed with fleeing bandits, dragging along their families. Women sobbed, children wailed, and scattered among them were Risunese warriors&mdash;all in utter disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised his hand.&nbsp;"Round them all up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fighters surged forward, surrounding them. Upon hearing that their&nbsp;level-four warrior&nbsp;leaders had not returned, most of the Sacred Spirit Gang's members didn't resist. Instead, they dropped to their knees, pleading for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander and Logan sat in the Sacred Spirit Gang's main hall, another two hours had passed. It was already afternoon, and everyone was starving. Alexander ordered food to be prepared while he and Logan interrogated several of the Sacred Spirit Gang's leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These leaders were all&nbsp;level-three warriors. At first, they had thoughts of resisting&mdash;but after Alexander swiftly executed a few Risunese captains, the remaining Hrodvik warriors surrendered without a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, a middle-aged man with sharp walnut-shaped eyes, stood out. He wore the robes of a scholar, an odd sight among the rough-looking warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt before Alexander and cupped his hands in greeting.&nbsp;"Mr. Hawthorne, I am Ryker. I am willing to serve you, even if it means holding your horse or fetching your boots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan sneered.&nbsp;"I bet you said the same thing to the Risunese, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker's face flushed bright red, like a priestey's rear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze was cold as he said,&nbsp;"At least you still know shame. Maybe you're not completely hopeless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker's face turned a mix of red and green as he said in a low voice, "I was forced to side with the Risunese, but I have never done anything to betray Hrodvik. I know the location of their hidden chamber and wish to offer it to you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan exchanged a look and grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker led them to a small stone house at the back of the Sacred Spirit Gang. When they pushed the door open, they saw that it was used for smoking meat and fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said awkwardly,&nbsp;"I only happened to see Klein and Adonis coming in and out of here, so I'm sure there's something suspicious about this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan shot him a glare and scoffed,&nbsp;"You don't even know for sure, and yet you claim you do? Go stand guard outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully examined the stone house. The floor was made of slate, and in the center was a large fire pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the fire pit, strips of smoked meat and fish hung from wooden racks. Piles of firewood were stacked on the side, and next to them sat a large bronze water vat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them searched the stone house carefully for a long time but found nothing. Frustrated, Logan was about to storm outside and give Ryker a piece of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flickered with thought. He grabbed the large water vat and gave it a firm lift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Something's off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He easily had the strength to lift a thousand pounds, yet the water vat didn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He twisted the vat slightly, and a faint grinding sound echoed. The slate beside it slowly shifted apart, revealing a dark, square opening about three feet wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grabbed some firewood, tied it into a torch, lit it, and tossed it down the hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below, a faint outline of a stone chamber could be seen. Alexander pressed his ear against the opening&mdash;silence. He and Logan secured their torches and descended the stone steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone chamber was about seven or eight meters wide. The air wasn't stale, suggesting that there were ventilation holes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Candlesticks lined the stone walls. They lit them and secured their torches, illuminating the entire room.</span></p></div>
