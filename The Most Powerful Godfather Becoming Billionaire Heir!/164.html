        <h1>Chapter 164 Allure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary rushed to the bedside, clutching her mother's hand, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad stood there, stunned, glancing back and forth between the elderly woman and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, "Is this... is this some kind of miracle? It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander was taken aback; he hadn't expected the woman to wake up so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Mary's excitement, he quickly urged, "Mary, your mother is still weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She needs to rest, and too much excitement could hinder her recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary snapped back to reality, casting a grateful glance at Alexander. She leaned down and whispered a few words in her mother's ear before reluctantly stepping away from the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was still standing there, unable to process everything that had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mixture of awe and fear flickered in his eyes as he turned to Alexander and asked, "Are you some sort of legendary witch doctor? I'm so sorry! Please </span><span>forgive my rudeness earlier</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A witch doctor was also a wizard, but because they preferred using their magical abilities to heal, they were known as witch doctors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only </span><span>smile</span><span>, dismissing his flattery and opportunism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary shot Brad a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Hank, my mom is awake now. Please take care of her </span><span>recovery</span><span> going forward. And stop bothering me about anything else. Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, then declared with resolve, "Mr. Hawthorne is my new boyfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad looked at Alexander with envy, his face falling in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taken aback, Alexander was puzzled by Mary's sudden declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's grab a bite. Come on," she said, firmly taking his hand and leading him out of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as they exited, Alexander couldn't </span><span>understand her intentions</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary playfully nudged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? Didn't you just say that if you helped my mom, you'd want my body in return?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... did I say that?" Alexander replied, genuinely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. She playfully pinched him at the waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't play coy with me! Do you think I'm going to throw myself at you? </span><span>Relax</span><span>, I'm not some </span><span>slutty </span><span>woman. Ever since my husband passed</span><span> away</span><span>, I haven't been with anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those gossipers out there claiming I swap partners every few days are just sour grapes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander scratched his head, trying to clarify his earlier statement, his expression suddenly </span><span>changed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" he exclaimed, pulling Mary close to him in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A black sports car sped past, skimming the exact spot where they had just been </span><span>standing before crashing into the flowerbed by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary quickly warned him, "Be careful, it's got to be my enemies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she tightened her embrace around Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The softness of her boobs pressed against him stirred unexpected feelings, and Alexander felt a natural response arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary noticed his reaction, instantly feeling a rush of embarrassment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pinched his dick, scolding, "</span><span>It</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s</span><span> not the time to be thinking about that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could only sigh; he couldn't help </span><span>it</span><span>, and Mary's pinching only fueled his desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Classic Mary&mdash;known for her allure in </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> elite circles&mdash;was just too irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her firmly, their bodies inevitably brushing against each other in ways that amplified the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary let out a soft gasp as jolts of electricity coursed through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been this close to a man in a while, and the sudden intimacy was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two more cars came barreling down the street, and a dozen burly men spilled out, surrounding the </span><span>two</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, with dyed red hair and a muscular build that left no doubt about his strength, pointed at Alexander, barking, "You better scram, or else you'll be the first to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, you come with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A big shot has taken a liking to you and wants you as his woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's anger flared instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, who the hell do you think you are?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted coming alone and not bringing more bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red-haired man, Mark Aniston, gave a sinister sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't matter who we are. All you need to know is that a big shot put out 10 million dollars to have you brought to him. And it's happening today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his venomous glare toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you until the count of three to get the hell out of here, or I'll make sure you regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One... two... three!"</span></p></div>
