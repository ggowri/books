        <h1>Chapter 625 Two Women</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another gem?" Olivia looked incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's continue." Alexander patted Olivia with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, as long as Alexander chose one ore, there would be a gem in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander was just lucky before, the current situation couldn't be explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had a thought in their mind. Could Alexander see-through stones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found all the ores that might contain high-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said to Olivia, "Let's go to your dad's office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia nodded with tears in her eyes, taking Alexander and Betty to the room inside the exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched Alexander leave with complicated expressions, all impressed by what he had done just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the office, Alexander sat in the chair and waved to Betty with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come over, Betty. Let me hug you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Olivia, Betty walked over and sat on Alexander's lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was stunned. Although she knew that a capable man like Alexander wouldn't have only one woman, she still thought the behavior of Alexander and Betty was too bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been observing Olivia's expression. Seeing that she didn't run away but stood there blushing and at a loss, he knew what she meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Alexander was getting stronger and stronger. Except for a woman with good skills like Rosalia, other women couldn't satisfy him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "How is Charlize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty said, "After taking the medicine prepared by you, she feels much better now, and the burned muscles and dead skin on her body are regenerating. I think it won't be long before she recovers and is discharged from the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. I hope she gets better soon." Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia stood there and listened to the two chatting. Seeing them hugging and kissing each other, she felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put his hand into Betty's skirt and said teasingly, "You're wearing a pink thong today. So sexy. Tell me, do you want me to have sex with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I miss you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed Alexander's neck gently and took the initiative to unbutton her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts were revealed, and even the large-sized bra could hardly hold them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty knew Olivia was watching them, but she knew Alexander did this to teach Olivia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Betty felt even more excited when Olivia watched her being intimate with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found herself becoming more and more attached to Alexander. Not to mention serving Alexander together with Olivia, even if she was asked to sacrifice her life, she would not hesitate at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reached his hand into Betty's skirt, stroking her thighs wrapped in pantyhose, and he was licking her plump flesh with his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I love you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty pouted and couldn't wait to tear off her skirt. She sat astride Alexander's legs and rode like a knight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and waved to Olivia. "Come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia blushed and walked in front of Alexander in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching his hands into her clothes, Alexander grabbed her breasts and started kneading them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia closed her eyes in enjoyment and couldn't help but cover Betty's plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty turned her head and kissed Olivia, and the two women kissed each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. Although Olivia had little experience, she was very sensitive, and her desire was rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the office was filled with the two women's moans, pleas for mercy, and Alexander's laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the spacious office at Mafia headquarters, Evan was standing in the middle of the room with a look of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was swollen and red, with bruised finger marks. Obviously, he was beaten by members of Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting at the desk was an ugly man with a scar on his face and gray hair. He was in his fifties and had a thick cigar in his mouth.</span></p></div>
