        <h1>Chapter 348 A Crush on Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany drew the shower curtain and breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in her twenties, but it was the first time that she had tried to seduce a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that Alexander wouldn't come in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Brittany faintly expected something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed very hot, and the sweat made her feel sticky and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany carefully took off all her clothes and put them aside to prevent them from getting wet, for she had brought no spare.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned on the shower. As the warm water gushed out, steam immediately rose in the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head back and closed her eyes under the shower, letting the warm water run over her plump body. She felt very comfortable and relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander was restless in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but stare at the bathroom. Even with the shower curtain obscuring the scene, he could make out the contours of Brittany's curvaceous figure, including her slender waist, rounded, full buttocks, long legs, and the way she scrubbed her breasts and buttocks.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The looming pictures were more seductive and exciting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the scene, no man would be able to resist pushing the door open. Besides, Brittany did not lock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had no idea why she had come to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath to suppress his desire and simply continued to sit cross-legged in meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, when Alexander opened his eyes, it was already evening. The street lights were on, presenting a beautiful night scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was asleep, reclining on the sofa beside him. She might have a sweet dream, for there was a smile on her pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander fixed his eyes on her cute and charming sleeping posture and couldn't help but gently stroke her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany groaned softly. Her face flushed, and even her breathing became heavier. It was obvious that she was pretending to be asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thompson, it's time to get up. Aren't you going to take me out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her nose with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are annoying. What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany sat up with a pouty look and straightened her disheveled dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, her full, plump breasts rippled like waves, which was very inviting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander picked up his phone and found that Madelyn had sent him a message a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Avery had other urgent business to deal with and had already flown back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thompson, may I invite you to have dinner with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made a gesture of invitation, and Brittany joyfully took his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, she had deliberately seduced him on Quentin's orders and because she was not averse to Alexander and even had some good feelings towards him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, he did not rush into the bathroom as she had expected. Instead of losing control because of her beauty, he respected her very much. There were not many men like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she had a crush on him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a commercial street ahead with some nice restaurants. Shall we walk over there?" Brittany asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. I'll listen to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They left the hotel, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany held Alexander's arm tightly, and they stepped forward together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full breasts pressed against his arm, and from time to time, they bumped against each other, which at once gave her a strange tingling sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander also felt her curvy figure and couldn't help but have an erection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they reached the commercial street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was brightly lit, and it was the prime time for dinner. There were a number of specialty restaurants, and numerous vendors set up stalls with a wide variety of snacks.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of delicious food wafted over, making people salivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Brittany arrived at a well-regarded restaurant and waited at the door for a table next to the window.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat down and tasted the food while watching the people coming and going in the street. It felt good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roasted beef, grilled fish, delicious crab, fresh vegetable salad, and mellow wine were served one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Brittany enjoyed the food and wine while chatting and learning about each other's past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, hurry up. You haven't paid this month's protection fee yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an extremely discordant and harsh voice rang out.</span></p></div>
