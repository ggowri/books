        <h1>Chapter 772 Be My Servant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Yvonne's mind, Alexander was supposed to be on the verge of agony, begging on his knees for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had full confidence in her poison&mdash;it had never failed her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander showed no signs of pain. Instead, he took a step forward and commanded her sharply, "Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The word boomed with the Force, like a thunderstorm exploding in Yvonne's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as though a fierce tempest had torn through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne screamed, clutching her head as her legs weakened, stumbling backward in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her confidence shattered; there was no trace left of her earlier pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... How are you not affected by the poison?" she stammered, stunned that Alexander appeared completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Panic gripped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spun around, trying to escape, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander appeared in front of her, his gaze locking onto hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Force surged through him, with his All-seeing Eyes and Force Control, holding her mind captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne gaped at him, her heart flooding with awe and fear, as if he were an invincible angel, standing above her with an aura of absolute power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of awe and reverence instantly rose within her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pointed at her as though commanding a disobedient child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The very air seemed to freeze. Yvonne shook her head, desperate to keep her thoughts clear, but her mind felt thick and sluggish, incapable of coherent thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander... You bastard, I won't submit to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's face twisted in defiance, her last remnants of resistance flaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She summoned every ounce of her strength, desperately fighting to stay conscious. With a final burst of energy, Yvonne unleashed three rounds of witchcraft against Alexander, even releasing her witchcraft insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But nothing worked&mdash;each attempt was effortlessly blocked by Alexander as though she were a mere jester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I said, kneel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander placed his hand on Yvonne's shoulder, forcing her to her knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a pained scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare make me kneel? I'll kill you!" she spat venomously, still struggling against him. Her body trembled, curves accentuated in her thrashing, a desperate allure in her rebellion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander barely glanced at her, entirely uninterested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no time for games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His only focus now was to fully subdue her with his Force Control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet this was uncharted territory. Controlling a witch was far more difficult than any Warrior&mdash;her mental strength was formidable, even by his standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Breaking Yvonne's willpower would require both persistence and a considerable amount of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had his abilities not evolved so dramatically, he wouldn't even have dared attempt it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you won't submit, then let me show you real pain," he said, channeling the Force into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy drilled through her like a relentless blade, burrowing deep into her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne crumpled, writhing on the ground, her screams echoing through the space as her body convulsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had no desire to kill Yvonne. Her ambition served as a stark reminder of her potential usefulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he eliminated Monica and allowed Yvonne to take over as the head of the City of Sorcery, it could work in his favor&mdash;provided he maintained absolute control over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The City of Sorcery was like a malignant growth; if not kept in check, the sorcerers would continue to cause chaos, unleashing spells and witchcraft insects that could harm countless innocents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The recent plague in Loscity was proof enough of the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Axe had been dealt a heavy blow, with Alyssa's kidnapping nearly severing Alexander's crucial support in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander watched as she lay motionless, barely breathing, her body twitching in spasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did he speak, his tone cold, "So, how does that compare to your so-called poison? Do you want to die a painful death, or will you submit and be my servant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please... I'll do anything... anything you ask... I'll be yours... serve you... even be your woman, but please, not a slave..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pleaded, clutching at his legs desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face twisted with pain, yet she forced a seductive smile, trying to tempt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tugged at her crimson robes, revealing her ample breasts, flaunting them with a practiced touch as she knelt before him, imploring for his mercy.</span></p></div>
