        <h1>Chapter 1283 Take It With Us</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Alexander had eaten the meat of a mutated black panther before, he hadn't felt a thing, and today's beef was no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that his exceptional physique rendered the meat of these mutated beasts ineffective for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Sally was just an ordinary person, and the sheer strength of the mutated bison had significantly boosted her physical abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a typical weak woman, she now possessed the stamina and strength comparable to an athlete, all from a single meal of mutated bison meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the bison's power was extraordinary; under normal circumstances, the meat of most mutated beasts wouldn't yield such impressive results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come help me get all this meat cooked! I want to take it with us!" Alexander called out, waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Sally jumped in to assist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They worked together seamlessly&mdash;Alexander cut the meat while Sally tended to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the air was filled with the mouthwatering aroma of roasting meat. Strangely, there were no zombies or mutated beasts around to bother them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was that the mutated bison had been the king of this area. The previous zombies and mutated creatures had either been killed or driven away by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Alexander had taken it down, the ground was soaked with its blood, leaving behind a strong scent that kept any potential threats at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out his satellite phone and contacted Ava to share the good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Augusta and the others backing them up, along with the resources from Treasure Island and Devil Island, they could easily hunt a large number of mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meat from these creatures could empower ordinary people, and over time, as humanity's overall strength increased, the zombies and beasts would become less of a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did Alexander know, he had stumbled upon a monumental secret that could shape the future of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three days of hard work, the last of the bison's meat had been cut and dried into jerky, leaving behind only a bare skeleton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that even after drying, they had at least one or two tons of meat&mdash;enough to require a vehicle for transport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here and keep an eye on the meat!" he instructed Sally before hopping on his bike and speeding off toward the road to fetch a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her enhanced physical abilities, Sally was more than capable of defending herself against ordinary zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lingering scent of the bison's blood would keep her safe for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alexander returned, driving a large Ford SUV loaded with plastic containers, the purpose of which was a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly began packing the jerky into the boxes, ready to grab a snack whenever hunger struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the salt-dried meat, they could expect it to last at least two to three months, even in the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" Alexander announced as he climbed into the driver's seat and started the engine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally jumped, startled. "Hey, wait! I'm not in yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Alexander rolled down the window. "I'll go slow. Just catch up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander slammed the gas pedal, and the SUV roared to life, speeding down the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally realized he was trying to push her limits and couldn't help but laugh through her frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she took off after him, determined to keep pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the boost from the mutated bison meat, she ran hard for nearly half an hour before finally stopping, breathless and leaning on her knees. Exhaustion washed over her, and she felt like she couldn't run another step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hit the brakes, bringing the vehicle to a halt. He reached into the back and pulled out a hefty piece of roasted meat, extending it toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here! Eat up! Once you finish, take a breather, and then we'll keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally didn't hesitate. She grabbed the meat and tore into it, savoring each bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the warm beef filled her stomach, it felt like a surge of energy coursed through her, recharging her body like a drained battery coming back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her reaction, Alexander nodded in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep running! The more you push yourself, the faster you'll grow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the two of them continued on their journey&mdash;one driving leisurely ahead while Sally chased after him, her determination unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, she found herself able to maintain a pace of twenty miles per hour for two hours straight, a feat that would be unimaginable for an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sally's speed, strength, and reflexes had surpassed those of marathon champions, weightlifting titans, and boxing experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few short days, Alexander had transformed her into a formidable athlete, all thanks to the power of the mutated bison meat.</span></p></div>
