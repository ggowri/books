        <h1>Chapter 400 Calling the Police</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked calmly toward Eugene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a smile and strolled casually, yet to Eugene, Alexander looked like a terrifying demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing over Eugene, Alexander looked down on him like a god gazing upon an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped his palm firmly against Eugene's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, with a loud bang, someone kicked open the front door from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen police officers burst into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hands up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the police, Eugene let out a long sigh of relief, feeling he was finally safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to see the police, with Melin in the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her uniform hugged her athletic figure, radiating a powerful, untouchable aura like that of an ice queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin looked at Alexander in shock; she hadn't expected to meet him in this kind of situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, are you alright?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze. Did Alexander look like he was in trouble? Clearly, they were the ones in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers began to gather around, but Melin held them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved them off. "It's alright; Mr. Hawthorne isn't the bad guy here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers hesitated, unsure what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who called in the report saying there was a killer here?" Melin asked, scanning the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She noticed that everyone present was a gang member and let out a dry laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one answered; heads hung low, not daring to admit it. Reporting to the police was just too humiliating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are wasting public resources! Take them all in!" Melin ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Melin's command, the officers were momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers stood confused, wondering what was up with Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no one move, Melin raised an eyebrow and shouted, "Are you deaf? Take them all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Eugene and the others get cuffed and loaded into the police vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene felt a surge of relief, thinking he had narrowly escaped death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold smile, knowing both Wyatt and Eugene had been affected by Force Annihilation and would likely die once they reached the police station, leaving him blameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, when you have time, I'd like to discuss this case with you," Melin said, blushing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her an amused smile. He knew she wasn't interested in the case details. She was interested in getting a bit more personal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'll call you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander's confirmation, Melin's spirits lifted, and she led Eugene and his crew away with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was left with just Alexander and Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was still stunned, never expecting events to turn out like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with emotion, Mary threw herself into Alexander's arms, pressing her full figure against him, her perfume filling the air around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, it seems like you've gotten even more... bouncy," Alexander joked with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it? If you do, kiss me harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's breathing grew rapid as she held Alexander's hand tightly against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've missed you so much these days. Right here, love me, give it to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right here?" Alexander felt a thrill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her mature beauty and allure, Mary possessed a seductive charm, unlike any other woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sparks flew!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They embraced, falling onto the conference table together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary pressed close to Alexander, savoring his kisses, and wrapped her hand around his powerful form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she touched him, her heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, you've gotten even bigger!" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she tugged down his zipper, and he sprang free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's eyes widened in disbelief. It was even more impressive than she'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed in awe. "You... you're destined to be the downfall of any woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled. "You like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do. I just don't know if I can handle it alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary felt both anticipation and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only imagine the incredible experience Alexander would give her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinned Mary down and leaned over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her soft, enticing moans echoed through the room, utterly electrifying.</span></p></div>
