        <h1>Chapter 453 Burning</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Masters of the sword were categorized into five levels&mdash;swordsman, </span><span>swordmaster</span><span>, great </span><span>swordmaster</span><span>, sword emperor, and sword sage. If Raven was a </span><span>swordmaster</span><span>, he was undoubtedly a master with the sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven stood with one foot slightly ahead of the other, his body center swaying slightly, maintaining an extremely delicate balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the rapier in his hand pointed slightly downward, a faint pale light flowing along its length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span> felt an immense pressure, intermingled with a bone-chilling cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, being at the forefront, felt it even more intensely. He hadn't expected Raven to be not only a skilled </span><span>swordmaster</span><span> but also a metahuman with freezing power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted lightly, unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ice and fire were natural enemies. Kyle had fire power, so Alexander used the Force to simulate freezing power to counter him, leading Kyle to believe he was also a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Raven's freezing power, Alexander would, of course, use the Force to simulate fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Force Burning technique was already overbearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven struck three rapid thrusts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three points of sword light, forming a triangle, stabbed toward Alexander's chest while the freezing power wreaked havoc, making Alexander feel as if he was being frozen solid, his body rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A </span><span>swordmaster</span><span> with freezing power was indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted coldly and unleashed the Force. His frozen body immediately returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a scorching energy erupted, dispersing Raven's three attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad! </span><span>So</span><span> you, like Kyle, are a metahuman with fire power. I underestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven roared, his sword striking like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he thrust five times, targeting Alexander's throat and chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a metahuman? You're insulting me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was absolutely right. The Force of an Intermediate Warrior far surpassed low-level powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only metahumans of level five and above could possibly engage in combat with Alexander as he was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's five attacks were easily dodged by Alexander, not even grazing the hem of his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my turn to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's aura surged, the Force erupting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dazzling sword light, the Lightsaber fell like a meteor from the sky, instantly severing Raven's rapier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's face paled, and he retreated hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late. The white beam had already brushed across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Raven retreated quickly, he still felt a sharp pain in his chest. Blood gushed out like a spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven looked down to see a sword wound as thick as a finger and as long as half an arm across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you also wield a sword! What kind of sword is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven stared at Alexander in shock, finding it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's figure flickered, and he appeared behind Raven like a specter before Raven could recover from his astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a flash of white light pass by him, and a sharp pain shot through his right arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his scream, Raven's right arm fell to the ground like a chicken wing severed by a kitchen knife, his blood splattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare to maim me? I am a </span><span>swordmaster</span><span> and a level-one metahuman. How could you possibly maim me! I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Badly injured, Raven had fallen into madness, howling like a wounded beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An icy frost suddenly erupted. Frost even formed on the ground and spread rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood flowed from Raven's eyes, nose, and even ears. He had become a grotesque and terrifying figure of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven was willing to damage his body in exchange for a short burst of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness of the frost doubled, forcing Ava and others to retreat in horror, but Alexander remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven was fighting desperately. If he couldn't kill Alexander, he would die from exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Force, burn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung his Lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two dazzling sword lights crossed to form a cross, darting across Raven's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raven's grotesque expression solidified, and his body bore a cross-shaped crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his entire body shattered into countless pieces of flesh and blood that fell to the ground, igniting small white flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold frost disappeared without a trace, burned away by these flames.</span></p></div>
