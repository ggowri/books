        <h1>Chapter 52 Don't Try Anything Stupid</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ouch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane winced in pain, clutching her backside and whimpering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda quickly steadied her daughter, then rounded on Alexander furiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the big idea? We've apologized for any wrongs. Can't you let it go already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander spat at their feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You tormented me for five whole years, and now you want to suck up to me? Do you think a half-assed apology can erase all that humiliation? Keep dreaming because that isn't happening. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander sneered, his voice dripping with disgust. "Jane, I never thought you'd stoop so low. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I'm sick to my stomach just looking at you. And frankly, you don't do anything for me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane's face contorted with rage. She jabbed her finger at Alexander, spitting out her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastard! What are you so smug about? If you hadn't wormed your way into Ava's bed, you'd have no reason to act so high and mighty with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander had enough of their nonsense. With their incompatible views, further discussion was pointless. He decided to show them the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost. I don't want to see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane let out a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you think you own Bevery Hills or something? We can't even walk through here? What if we don't leave? What are you gonna do about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander wasn't taking the bait, Belinda immediately changed her tune and started mouthing off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're nothing but a goddamn gold digger! First, you leeched off us, the Fairfax family, and now you're kissing Ava's ass. You're not even a real man, you useless piece of shit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When Ava gets bored of you, she'll toss you aside. Let's see how cocky you are then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander snapped, his temper flaring. "Get lost before I forget you're women."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane smirked, pulling out her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Trying to scare me? Didn't Billy put you in the hospital last time? I'm the one who sicced him on you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think that bitch Ava can protect you forever. One call and I'll have Billy here to end you. Try me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Alexander couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy was sweating bullets, glaring fiercely at that dimwit Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander's smile, Jane mistook it for fear and became even more smug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, you're scared now, aren't you? Apologize right this second, and I won't call Billy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smirked, his face dripping with sarcasm. "You think I'm scared of some nobody like Billy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane wouldn't let up, pressing on relentlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Listen here, Alexander. You've got one minute to apologize, or I'm calling Billy over to end you. He's the top dog in the Wolf Gang, you know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava might be hot stuff, but she's not here. You really think she's got any pull with the Wolf Gang?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander ignored her, turning to Billy with an amused grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She claims one phone call from her and you'll take me out. That right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy shot Jane a nasty glare before bowing his head respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wouldn't dream of it, sir. Even if I had the balls of a thousand men, I wouldn't dare lay a finger on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander looked at Jane with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you hear that? He said he wouldn't dare lay a finger on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, not knowing Billy, scoffed mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's he supposed to be? Don't act like you're a big shot just because you've got a few goons. I don't know you, pal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy grinned as he pulled out a knife, his voice chilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bitch, weren't you going to call me? I'm Billy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? No way... You're Billy? How are you with him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane paled, utterly bewildered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Last time, I didn't dare mess with Mr. Hawthorne, but now I think I'll wreck you both."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy's grin widened, revealing his vicious nature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think you're doing? This is Bevery Hills, there's security everywhere. Don't try anything stupid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane and Belinda's faces went white as sheets, their legs shaking uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm about to do something real stupid. Grab 'em!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy waved his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help! Murder! Somebody helps us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane and Belinda spun around and ran, screaming as they fled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let it go. Let them leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's voice cut in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy fumed. "Boss, we're just gonna let those shameless broads walk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shook his head, his face expressionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it. If anyone's gonna handle this, it'll be me personally. You focus on what I asked you to do. Pull it off, and I'll consider it a job well done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy perked up instantly. Staying on Alexander's good side was crucial if he wanted to make it in Loscity.</p></div>
