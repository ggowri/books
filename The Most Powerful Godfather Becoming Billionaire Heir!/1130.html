        <h1>Chapter 1130 Undercover</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out his cell phone and dialed Elaine's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ringtone sounded for a long time, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but frown, realizing that it was impossible to find Yinson through Elaine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since his departure from Risun, he had lost contact with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Controlled by the Force, she worked undercover under Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alexander's surprise, she disappeared before he could make good use of her, and she was probably killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he remained silent, Xavier hurriedly filled Alexander's glass with beer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I think Tobias is quite sensible and hardworking. </span><span>Maybe </span><span>he'</span><span>s </span><span>not Yinson's man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "Xavier, I bet this Tobias is with Yinson. He planted him to get to Ultimate Alliance through you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier's face darkened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If so</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>why did he </span><span>need to </span><span>poison me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander explained calmly, "Yinson relied on the Immortality Serum to develop a strengthening potion that is harmful to normal people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are poisoned with that potion, or you are infected. If nothing goes wrong, when the poison takes effect, Tobias will threaten you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must have drugs that can delay the onset of the poison. Because of your desire to survive, you will have no choice but to be at their disposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier jumped up in shock and asked in a trembling voice, "Boss, will I become a living dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his arm and said, "Don't worry. I will treat you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He injected a powerful Force into Xavier's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier shuddered and felt burning hot and energetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Alexander released him and said, "Okay. I have cleared all the poison within you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's great. Boss, you are really awesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier was overjoyed and really felt a great deal more at ease.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tapped his arm and urged, "Eat </span><span>it</span><span>. After breakfast, I'll go to Phoenix Gemstone Establishment to meet Tobias. It will be great if we can find clues about Yinson from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. If Tobias is really an undercover agent of the Sakra Society, I'm going to skin him alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier had a serious and murderous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded secretly. Xavier used to be timid. In order to collect the top-grade gems for Alexander, he traveled to all the gem-producing areas around the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having encountered various people and many dangers, he was no longer the same as before but had become resolute and decisive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm full. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier finished his spaghetti in no time and couldn't sit still any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and shook his head, knowing that Xavier really wanted to settle the score with Tobias. They got into the car together</span><span> hurriedly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming to Gemstone Street again, Alexander found that it had changed a lot and became more prosperous. More and more customers came in an endless stream to buy gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Xavier, you manage it well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier smiled, "It's all thanks to my mother. I am out on errands. Mainly because of the support of the Ultimate Alliance, no one on this street dares to disobey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two security guards were standing at the door of Phoenix Gemstone Establishment. At the sight of Xavier, they hurriedly came up to him with grins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ulysses, good morning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier nodded. Alexander winked at him, and they walked straight in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two security guards did not know Alexander, but seeing that Xavier was very respectful to him, they treated him with great courtesy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Tobias here?" Xavier asked the receptionist casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionist smiled gently, "Tobias just went in. Mr. Ulysses, do you need me to call him over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier waved his hand and then looked at Alexander. They entered quietly into the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a ding, the elevator doors opened, and they stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The building belonged to the Ulysses family. The front was a shop. The upper floors were used as offices, and the underground space was a warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier and Alexander reached the floor, only to find that the office was empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Where's Tobias?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Xavier was puzzled.</span></p></div>
