        <h1>Chapter 1347 Rescue You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode in, and as he pushed open the stone door, he found an empty room lit by torches on the walls. A dozen young women huddled together, shivering against the stone wall. They were the women from the carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander took a closer look, he couldn't help but chuckle. One of the women had ash smeared all over her face. But even through the mess, he recognized her as the missing lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and waved at her, "Come here! Don't be afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a mix of annoyance and amusement. With a serious tone, he called out, "Come here! If you don't, I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde, holding back tears, finally stepped forward slowly, inching her way toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot her a deliberately fierce look and commanded, "Follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and left, leading Isolde behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the door, a sword-wielding Risunese whispered urgently, "Mr. Hawthorne, what should we do with these women? Mr. Burkart hasn't given any instructions yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Alexander slapped him hard across the face. Dazed, the man saw stars and barely registered Alexander's words as he watched him swagger away with the most beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the guest room, Alexander asked Zamir to stand guard outside and shut the door behind him. When he turned around, he was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde had huddled in the corner, clutching her clothes with her left hand and holding a cup high in her right hand, her expression firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, feeling helpless, rubbed his forehead and sat on the bed, muttering, "Do I look like a bad guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed and said, "Anyway, if you prefer being here, I'll reluctantly tell Lana that you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lana? You..." Isolde interrupted, slamming the cup down on the table. She rushed to the bed, embraced Alexander, and cried, "You really came to rescue me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swallowed hard, thinking, "She has a lovely figure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied softly, "Don't worry, Ms. Mess, I'll protect you, but you have to listen to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde giggled, "I'm not Ms. Mess; my name is Isolde."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cleared his throat, "Alright, Isolde. Could you let me go now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed, and she released him. Looking up, she noticed his thick eyebrows, bright eyes, and a noble nose&mdash;what a striking young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Isolde, taking in her pretty face and graceful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, they were lost in each other's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, far from Walgus Hill, Zain, Logan, and the others were searching for four carriages abandoned in a grove beside the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing!" Logan shouted in frustration, punching the carriage, causing a wooden board to splinter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zain's expression was grim as he tightened his grip on his sword, speaking in a hoarse voice, "The Walgus Hill pine forest is where the last secret sign is located. Logan, Ruben, and I will team up to head back to the pine forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The post station isn't far ahead. Mr. Sutton and his guards are already waiting there. Seth, you three lead a team to keep pursuing. If nothing seems off, meet up with Mr. Sutton to pick us up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had been tracking and searching since yesterday without a drop of water and were exhausted. They sat down to eat some food before parting ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside Alexander's door, Zamir stood for a long time. At first, he could hear the two talking, but gradually it fell silent, and he hesitated to barge in without permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After another hour, unable to wait any longer, he gently pushed the door open, peeking inside. His face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Isolde lay spread-eagled on the bed, sound asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde had been terrified and hadn't slept all night. Now that there was hope of rescue, she had dozed off while talking to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted after a day and night without sleep, Alexander fell asleep too when he noticed Isolde resting peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander eventually woke up, it was already dark outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Isolde, who was sleeping soundly, and quietly opened the door to step out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he closed the door behind him, Isolde opened her eyes wide with a playful smile.</span></p></div>
