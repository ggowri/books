        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's phone rang. It was Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's voice came through. "Mr. Hawthorne, we've breached their defenses, but we're facing heavy resistance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Alexander figured the timing was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured confidently to his men. "Move out! Launch the attack now. Today, we take down the Red Umbrella Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's lips curved into a sinister smile, his body starting to glow with an eerie, blood-red aura that flickered in and out of visibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward eagerly. "Sir, let me take point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he spoken than a swarm of black bats materialized, enveloping him completely. With a whoosh, William vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky suddenly filled with countless black bats, their massive numbers blotting out the light like storm clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander couldn't help but marvel at the supernatural display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move," he said calmly, leading his men forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Red Umbrella Group headquarters, the blaring alarms were deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive surveillance screens were lit up with red dots as hundreds of Red Umbrella Group members monitored and analyzed incoming data.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alert! Our combat personnel have been reduced by thirty percent... Enemy attacks are intensifying, and our casualties continue to rise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Code Red Emergency! The enemy force includes twelve enhanced soldiers in combat armor, over a hundred metahumans with various powers, and numerous highly skilled martial artists!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to our calculations, we'll be completely wiped out in forty minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Data kept flowing in, displayed on the central giant screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone </span><span>stay</span><span> calm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A commanding voice rang out as Felix and Rock Rossetti, the Grand Elder of the City of Sorcery, appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them stood a middle-aged man in traditional samurai garb. With two katanas at his waist and an imposing aura, he radiated deadly competence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix thundered, "Why are you all panicking when I'm right here? We still have forty minutes, don't we? Anyone who continues to spread fear will face execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I order the full activation of the magic circle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes blazed with fury, his terrifying aura making hundreds of people tremble in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, don't waste your anger on these worthless fools. Let's check on the battle!" Rock suggested, his black robes flowing around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face hardened as he barked at the subordinates, "What are you waiting for? Activate the magic circle now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes sir, right away! The magic circle is charging with the gemstones!" a worker stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a thunderous boom shook the plaza as the massive pentagram began pulsing with crimson light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Treasure Island shuddered as an invisible force exploded outward in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant monitoring screens lit up with over a dozen camera feeds showing the battles raging outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in God's name is that?" a samurai </span><span>gasped,</span><span> his eyes wide with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screens showed countless black bats swarming around a humanoid blood mist, wreaking havoc across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Red Umbrella Group caught in the swarm of bats instantly withered into a mummy before collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more terrifying was the blood mist itself. With each victim drained by the bats, it grew darker red and expanded its reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This nightmarish scene was worse than hell itself, far beyond what any average expert could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and Rock's brows furrowed deeply. This supernatural display was entirely outside their expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rossetti, this doesn't seem like an ordinary opponent. What kind of creature is helping the Brilliant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix pointed at the blood mist on the screen, his eyes filled with confusion and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always assumed Cloe was behind the attacks since she had seemingly taken control of the Brilliant Group after Guzman's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned expectantly to Rock, the Grand Elder of the City of Sorcery. He was known as the most powerful dark wizard, just one step away from ascending to white wizard status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ancient Grimoire in his possession, Rock's combat ability rivaled that of an average white wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock's expression turned grave as he spoke slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It looks like the work of a vampire from the old legends. And not just any vampire, but one with Advanced bloodline. Nothing else could control this many vampire bats or use blood mist as cover to move around in broad daylight."</span></p></div>
