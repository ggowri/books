        <h1>Chapter 947 A Slim Chance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile spread across Jaxon's face. The poison on the needles was a secret concoction he had created himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one other than him knew the antidote. Even if they were rushed to the hospital, it would be a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poison needles were one of the hardest to defend against. Most people wouldn't even see them coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon was confident. He knew Alexander and Cloe would be struck by the poison, and when that happened, they'd come crawling to him for the cure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his shock, Alexander simply waved his hand. The poison needles hit an invisible wall of force and dropped to the ground as if they'd hit stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon froze, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a dismissive sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost is this pathetic? You two clowns thought you could run wild on Treasure Island?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another flick of his hand, a powerful surge of force filled the room. The poison needles, now lying on the ground, were sent flying back at even greater speed, faster than they came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the needles slicing through the air was deafening, like tearing fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon and Cynthia didn't even have time to blink. They were caught off guard by the sheer speed and power of Alexander's counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon grabbed Cynthia and yanked her aside, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dodged most of the needles, but a few still pierced them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!" Jaxon gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fumbled through his jacket and pulled out a small vial, quickly swallowing a few pills. He handed some to Cynthia as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched the scene with a cold, amused smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't interested in watching them die. He needed them alive, so he could get some answers about the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though both Jaxon and Cynthia had taken the antidote, the poison was potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They collapsed to the floor, their bodies shaking uncontrollably, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon's glare was still burning with hatred, though now there was a flicker of fear in his eyes. He was defiant, but the situation was getting out of hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned his head toward Cloe, who immediately understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a quick nod and barked out the order, "The auction is over. Please settle your bids at the Brilliant Group later. Everyone else, leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, a wave of fully armed guards poured in, surrounding the room with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the guests, recognizing Cloe, quickly made their way out, eager to avoid any trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was the Brilliant Group controlling Treasure Island or the infamous Ghost, neither was a force to be reckoned with. Staying out of their way was the only smart move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall cleared out in minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you dare kill us? We're with the Ghost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's voice was lower now, trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a cold, mocking smile. "I actually like making new friends. How about you stay here and have a little chat about your organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's face turned ghostly pale. She raised her voice in a final threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you have any idea what the Ghost really is? The higher-ups of the Ghost are the most powerful figures in the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand what you're messing with? The Ghost represents the highest power. Gangs, wealthy families... they're nothing compared to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can imprison us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile only grew colder. "Quentin is just a low-level member of the Ghost. </span><span>So</span><span> what does that make you two? You're not even bottom-tier. You're just the Ghost's lapdogs, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> tell me, do you think the big shots at the top are going to care about you two little dogs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's eyes widened in shock and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon's fists were also clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are clueless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, unhurried, as he strolled toward Cynthia. His calm, confident expression was like he was out for a walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I promise you'll spill everything you know, and you'll die without feeling a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia felt a shiver run down her spine as Alexander's smile grew ever more sinister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that today, there was no other option but to fight for a slim chance of survival.</span></p></div>
