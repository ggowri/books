        <h1>Chapter 611 Olivia Asked for Help</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander recognized the hulking figure before him as Malvern McGregor, a former low-ranking member of the Wolf Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malvern had been too insignificant to even follow Billy around. After Billy had been executed, Betty reorganized the Wolf Gang and kicked Malvern out for his unsavory behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't fathom running into him here. But the brute hadn't yet recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman clutched Alexander's arm tightly, panic etched across her face. "Please, don't leave me! I'll give you the gem, I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, she pulled out a small, exquisite piece of gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes lit up&mdash;he hadn't expected her to carry such a high-quality gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was only the size of a mustard seed, it was precisely one of the top-grade gems he sought to collect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With tears in her eyes, the woman pleaded, "This gem is for you. Please, just don't leave me with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled gently, "What's your name? How old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Olivia... I'm nineteen," she mumbled, looking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the thugs were seething with rage at Alexander's apparent disrespect. He was chatting casually with the woman instead of backing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Are you looking for trouble? You'd better scram before things get ugly!" Malvern barked, his face aflame with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's smile faded, a cold seriousness overtook him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't recognize me? When you were with the Wolf Gang, you were nothing but a lowly piece of trash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malvern stood frozen, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped closer, squinting to make out Alexander's features in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y... You're Mr. Hawthorne?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flickered in Malvern's eyes. Everyone knew how highly respected Alexander was during Billy's reign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were uncertain of his dealings, it was clear that he was someone to be reckoned with; otherwise, Billy wouldn't have treated Alexander with such caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, since you remember me, I'll cut to the chase. I'm taking this woman with me. You all can clear off," Alexander said assertively, grabbing Olivia's hand and preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malvern quickly blocked their path, forcing a smile that didn't reach his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, hold on a second! I'm with the Mafia now. Mr. Paltrow has given the order to bring Olivia and the gem back with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malvern was sure that mentioning the "Mafia" would intimidate Alexander into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mafia?" Alexander chuckled, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father had long been at odds with the Godfather known as SATAN, associated with the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malvern, you're in Loscity, which belongs to the Ultimate Alliance. Your Mafia orders don't mean squat here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Infuriated, Malvern shouted, "How dare you, Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't give me that crap! The Mafia fears no one! Screw this Ultimate Alliance! We're taking that woman and the gem, and if you get in our way, I'll wipe the floor with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression hardened. "Then don't say I didn't warn you; you're stepping into dangerous water here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malvern opened his mouth to retort, but before he could say a word, there was a sickening crunch&mdash;he suddenly found himself staring backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other thugs recoiled in shock, taking several steps back as they witnessed Malvern's head twist at an unnatural angle, and with a heavy thud, he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of his boys took off running, while others brandished knives, charging at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift kick, Alexander sent one assailant flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then proceeded to take down the remaining thugs one by one with brutal efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia stood in disbelief, wide-eyed as the melee unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Alexander urged, pulling her toward a sleek black Mercedes parked nearby, a car left by Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were inside, Olivia suddenly threw herself at Alexander, pressing a fervent kiss on his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help me! I can give you the gem, I'll give you everything I have. I just need you to save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander touched his cheek, turning to look into Olivia's tear-brimmed eyes. They were enchanting despite the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, tell me what you need help with," he said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll tell you everything!" Olivia agreed, spilling out the troubles that had led her to this dangerous crossroads.</span></p></div>
