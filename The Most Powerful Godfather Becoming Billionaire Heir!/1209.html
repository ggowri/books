        <h1>Chapter 1209 Public Mockery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was riding high on confidence, completely sure that Alexander couldn't possibly outrun him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a split second, Alexander had completely vanished from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Where'd he </span><span>go</span><span>?" Gael's face went pale as he frantically jumped backward at top speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that seriously the best you can do?" Alexander's mocking voice rang out from behind him. "You're barely faster than a turtle, and you have the nerve to look down on regular people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you think you're the future of humanity with that kind of speed?" Alexander kept pace right behind Gael, throwing out one taunt after another. No matter how hard Gael pushed himself, he couldn't shake him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! You sneaky bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was so furious he could taste blood in his mouth. He'd pushed himself beyond his limits, but he still couldn't catch even a glimpse of Alexander&mdash;just that irritating voice always right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were in a real battle, he'd be dead already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop hiding and face me, you coward!" Gael roared in frustration. He couldn't believe Alexander was managing to stay perfectly positioned behind him this whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Part of him wondered if Alexander was just hiding somewhere, playing mind games with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!" With a laugh, Alexander suddenly materialized right in front of Gael, making him jump out of his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a level-three metahuman, and you think you can rule the world? That's hilarious!" Alexander's voice dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's face turned ashen as shame and anger fought for control. Right then, he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the squad members watching, being publicly mocked by Alexander&mdash;and not being able to do a damn thing about it&mdash;felt worse than death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Alexander's voice was cold. "Still think you've got what it takes? Come on, show me everything you've got. I'll make sure you know exactly where you stand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He taunted Gael with a condescending finger curl, looking at him like he was nothing more than an ant beneath his shoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! I'm going to kill you!" Gael roared. His rage finally boiled over, and he couldn't take it anymore, charging at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's fingers curled into claws as he lunged for Alexander's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury fueled his speed, pushing him to the brink of level-four speed powers. The air cracked and split around him, whipping up into a terrifying vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The squad members gasped in shock. At this close range, none of them believed they could dodge such a devastating attack. They knew they'd be toast if they were in Alexander's shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander just smirked. He moved even faster than Gael, appearing suddenly at his side. Before anyone could blink, he swung his arm and landed a brutal slap across Gael's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack sound echoed through the room as Gael's body went flying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael went flying like he'd been hit by a truck, his body arcing through the air before crashing hard about fifty feet away. He tumbled across the ground like a ragdoll, finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from his mouth as he let out a pained cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had enough yet, kid?" Alexander towered over Gael's crumpled </span><span>form,</span><span> his eyes gleaming with deadly intent. "If not, feel free to get back up for round two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd actually gone easy on Gael, considering Gael had just tried to kill him. But if this idiot didn't know when to quit, Alexander had no problem sending him straight to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael stayed quiet, his face twisted with rage and hatred, but he didn't say a word. He wasn't stupid&mdash;he could feel the murderous intent rolling off Alexander in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gael!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of his teammates came rushing over, quickly helping Gael to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was gasping for air, his shirt soaked red with blood. Half his face was swollen up like a balloon, clear finger marks standing out against his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap had been brutal, but at least he'd kept all his teeth. It could have easily knocked a few loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just beat up my friend like that?" One of the newcomers glared at Alexander. "You got a death wish or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, you want to jump in and defend him?" Alexander's lips curved into a cold smile. "Fine by me. I'll take all of you on at once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's dominance sent them into an absolute frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys weren't your average fighters. They didn't make it onto the squad team by being soft. They immediately teamed up with Gael, launching a coordinated attack on Alexander from three different angles.</span><span> </span></p></div>
