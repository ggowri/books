        <h1>Chapter 1412 Entered the Shelter</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson, deep in the underground base, vaguely felt a great threat and looked stern. He never expected these people to be able to control such terrifying weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, on the endless ice field in the north of Raquel, several large-scale military buildings with a sci-fi look stand on the vast plain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was Raquel's intercontinental ballistic missile early-warning base. This hidden base couldn't be found on civilian maps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On military maps, this area was marked with a striking red line. Without special permission, no one could enter this area within three miles of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The base was a complex of buildings on the ice field. It extended hundreds of feet deep into the hard permafrost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were not only the most advanced strategic early-warning radars that could detect targets thousands of miles away but also a launch base for dozens of intercontinental missiles carrying atomic warheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most powerful country on the earth had tens of thousands of atomic warheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This base on the ice field was on duty all year, without any slack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roderick Byrne, the commander of this base, was sitting on a tall seat in the central control room, looking coldly at the data on the circular LCD screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of his family and himself, he wanted to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roderick's face was pale with a tinge of ashen color. Just half an hour ago, he received a warning from the military department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to eliminate the monsters, atomic weapons would be launched globally immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Roderick cursed with a ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raquel had fallen into the monster crisis, and many small and medium-sized countries were deeply mired in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roderick thought, "Destroy the whole world? These crazy lunatics. Go to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe they're just drunk or have some mental abnormality. But it's said that all countries around the world have received this warning. It should be a prank, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roderick tried to calm down, but he could hardly convince himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All countries around the world had received the warning sent by Rudolph that the earth would be destroyed along with those monsters by atomic weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hour after receiving the warning, the astronauts in Moon Walker, the only still-operating space station, issued a warning that hundreds of intercontinental missiles had been launched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was not all. In just a few minutes, hundreds of intercontinental missiles had been launched, and their landing points covered all regions of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, some powerful countries were the key targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The astronauts reacted quickly. Immediately, they used the space-based weapons deployed on the space station and in space orbit and successfully shot down dozens of intercontinental missiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a small part of the remaining ones still reached their target locations, raising huge mushroom clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Counter-attack with all your might! Activate the emergency mechanism and stop them from launching more missiles!] This was the order Roderick received.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of flames soared from the ice field. This was the place closest to Adcock. In less than half an hour, these terrifying missiles could hit the opponents' capitals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a time, more and more glows flickered in the night sky. The number of missiles fired by several parties this time was as many as over five hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The images transmitted back by the monitoring system on Moon Walker were like a fireworks show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the blue earth, huge flames rose, like a beautiful yet destructive fireworks show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the electronic map, centered around capitals, together with several continents, a bloody and terrifying death net was formed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when the first round of atomic weapons was launched, the highest-level emergency shelter warning was immediately issued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Treasure Island, it was in complete chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry into the underground shelter!" Augusta and a group of fully armed team members protected Ava, Betty, and many other high-level officials, entering the underground shelter in an orderly manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander!" Standing at the entrance of the shelter, Ava looked into the distance, her beautiful eyes filled with tears, looking extremely pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander will be fine. He has his fortune." Augusta looked solemn as he pressed the electric button.</span></p></div>
