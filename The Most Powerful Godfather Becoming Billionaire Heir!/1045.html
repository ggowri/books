        <h1>Chapter 1045 Get Shot</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crash, the door was broken open, and a group of men rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith, drenched in cold sweat, gritted his teeth and, determined, jumped into the next room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is he? Where did he go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he jump? He can't survive from this height!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several angry voices shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them peered outside and spotted black footprints on the ledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He climbed over to the next room! Go after him, quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of men charged out of the room, rushing to the next, but Keith was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Keith raced downstairs. His heart pounded, his limbs felt weak, and more than once, he nearly stumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Urgent footsteps and shouts were right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith quickened his pace, running as fast as he could down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wheezing, he reached the first floor, leaning against his knees, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, two men in black noticed him, and their eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were supposed to be guarding the entrance of the building. The apartment building's security guard had been knocked out cold, lying motionless nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, isn't that our target for this mission? No matter how fast you run, you can't outrun us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men flashed menacing smiles as they closed in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One drew a knife, the other pulled out an electric baton, both aiming to capture Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith, now even more tense, slowly began to retreat, searching for any openings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Alexander leaving a bit of Force in him, Keith's strength and speed were enhanced. He could handle a couple of ordinary men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keith, you're a star from Dragon Film and Television Company, messed around with plenty of pretty women. I'm so jealous, you know. I'm going to cut off that thing of yours and see if you can still enjoy yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the baton taunted, flicking the baton to make a crackling sound, trying to intimidate Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith suddenly lunged, punching the man in the right eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man screamed in pain, instinctively reaching for his eye, and Keith seized his hand, shoving the baton into that man's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of electric shocks crackled, and the man collapsed, twitching and frothing at the mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the knife was stunned. He hadn't expected Keith, who looked like a delicate, pretty boy, to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were elite agents from Sakra Society, but not quite at the killer level, and surprisingly, they were even a little weaker than Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't underestimated him, two-on-one might still have worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Keith had taken down one of them, he unleashed all his potential in the face of life-threatening danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the knife stumbled back several steps, even considering running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith grabbed the baton, charging at the remaining man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flashed in the man's eyes as he frantically swung his knife at Keith's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith dodged, the baton slamming into the man's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man couldn't even scream before he collapsed, convulsing and rolling his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Keith couldn't believe how easily he'd taken down two killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him escape! Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouts and footsteps grew louder as the killers from upstairs arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith immediately dashed out of the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a bald-headed killer named Lionel Truman came after him, raising a silenced pistol and aiming for Keith's back. Then, he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muffled shot rang out, and Keith suddenly felt a sharp pain in his back, followed by a powerful force that knocked him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to get up, Keith stumbled forward, taking two more steps before collapsing heavily on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything spun around him, blood staining his body, but he knew he couldn't fall now. If he did, it was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared in anger, fighting to stay conscious, and staggered forward again.</span></p></div>
