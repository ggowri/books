        <h1>Chapter 550 Let's Compete</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hated it most when people called him a country bumpkin. That was what Nancy called him, and he would always remember that humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay hated Alexander. The realization that Alexander must have slept with Nancy annoyed him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "I'm here to treat Ms. Elaina Gomez today, not to fight with you. If you have the ability, let's compete to see who can cure her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay sneered, "You aren't worthy enough to compete with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists and grew fierce. In the eyes of Orlando and his men, Clay seemed to have grown taller, and his aura was overwhelmingly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, you don't have to scare me. If you don't dare to compete, I advise you to leave </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> as soon as possible and stop approaching Nancy. Otherwise, you will suffer the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a dead silence, and the atmosphere was tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay took a deep breath, his knuckles crackling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you want to compete with me, right? Okay. Whoever of us can cure Ms. Elaina Gomez will win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The loser should apologize for three days and three nights and then get out of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> forever. Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay stared at Alexander like a tiger staring at a lamb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that I will win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed a half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay sneered, "You can only win if the sun rises from the west."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's settled!" Alexander agreed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay waved his hand. "Mr. Gomez, please send someone to guard the door to prevent this guy from running away. He must apologize to me later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Burch. Leave everything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando made a gesture, and countless bodyguards immediately surrounded the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will let you go first, so you won't blame me for bullying you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay pointed at Alexander with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you go first. Otherwise, you will have no chance once I make a move. Then, you might complain shamelessly that I won't give you a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's refusal was so reasonable that it almost pissed Clay off to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you don't want the chance, I will go first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay walked to the bedside confidently and pretended to treat Elaina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered secretly. He had long discovered that she was under witchcraft and that it must be Clay who was behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Clay was sure to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had used the Force to isolate Elaina's body, allowing him to destroy the evil energy within her at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, before lifting the witchcraft, Clay must first eliminate the influence </span><span>of the Force. It depended on his ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone widened their eyes and stared at him nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando didn't even dare to blink for fear of missing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your eyes wide open and watch how I heal Ms. Elaina Gomez!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While taunting Alexander, Clay pulled out a black dragon head stick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled contemptuously and prepared to watch Clay's embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay was muttering something. After a while, a faint light appeared on the black dragon head stick, revealing a strange aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature in the room seemed to have dropped by several degrees. Except for Alexander, everyone felt a chill on their back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doctor asked curiously, "Does witchcraft work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another doctor said with displeasure, "If it works, what do we doctors do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was angry. "Shut up! You </span><span>quacks</span><span>, don't bother Mr. Burch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone fell silent, and no one dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay confidently placed the dragon head stick on Elaina and moved it smoothly and swiftly to draw several pentagram formations. The series of movements was dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a ball of black energy appeared in her chest, surging and rolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gasped, wondering what it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando gazed at it intently in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this? Could it be that Ms. Elaina Gomez has really been bewitched?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was very curious. They stood on tiptoe to watch, afraid of missing any details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was very excited, thinking, "My daughter is finally saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alexander snorted coldly with a playful smile.</span></p></div>
