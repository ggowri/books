        <h1>Chapter 243 No Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was indeed a master, and his years in high positions had made him resolute and decisive. Even though he felt dazed and his vision blurred, a part of his mind remained clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his tongue hard, spitting out a mouthful of blood. The sharp pain snapped him back to reality. Though he wasn't under Alexander's control, his injuries had left him at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive," Alexander remarked, realizing he needed to increase his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, Alexander stomped the ground forcefully, creating a spider-web of cracks. The impact propelled him toward John like a cannonball, closing the gap between them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel!" Alexander commanded, pressing his palm onto John's shoulder with overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John felt himself being pushed down, but he roared defiantly, "Alexander, you're a spy! How dare you ambush me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mustering all his strength, John managed to hold Alexander's palm, standing firm like a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander admired John's willpower, but knew it was futile against the vast difference in their strength. He unleashed the Force, and their palms collided, sending an invisible shockwave through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was thrown backward, landing heavily on the ground. Without hesitation, Alexander moved in like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his right hand broken, John felt a surge of fear as Alexander approached. "Run!" he thought, turning to flee with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can escape?" Alexander taunted, accelerating toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand shot out like an eagle's claw, aiming for John's neck. John felt the force closing in, suffocating him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!" John shouted, turning to face Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's speed was too much. As John turned, he felt a sharp pain in his throat&mdash;Alexander had already seized his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's breathing was cut off, his face turning red. "Let... me go!" he gasped, struggling desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his palm to John's forehead, the Force surging like a flood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's struggles ceased as his mind descended into chaos. He stared blankly at Alexander, unable to resist his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Guzman? Tell me," Alexander demanded, his eyes gleaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John's voice quivered as he answered, "He's... on the large cruise ship, the Neptune..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Neptune?" Alexander repeated, glancing at the luxurious cruise ship docked in the distance. He hadn't expected Guzman to hide there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the relationship between the Brilliant Group and the Red Umbrella Group?" Alexander asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They used to cooperate, but recently their relationship has soured. The Red Umbrella Group stopped supplying us with potential potions... They might want to take us over," John replied mechanically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander knew John was telling the truth. The competition for the Godfather's inheritance meant his brothers would target each other, not just him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the real name of the Red Umbrella Group's chairman? Is he on the island?" Alexander pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John paused before answering, "I only know his surname is Ramirez. I don't know his full name, and he's definitely not on the island. His whereabouts are a mystery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ramirez?" Alexander mused, smiling bitterly. All three brothers shared their mother's surname. He still didn't know his father's name, a man he had never met.</span></p></div>
