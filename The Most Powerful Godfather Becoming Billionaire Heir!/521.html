        <h1>Chapter 521 Brimming With Confidence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diego, what do you think of Felix?" Barry asked suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's face took on a thoughtful look, and after a moment, he replied, "I think Felix is just biding his time, and the moment he gets a chance, he'll turn on us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, he's a vicious wolf, but I'm not worried. No matter how fierce the wolf, it can't escape the hunter's grip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Joyce took some coffee beans from an ornate box and started brewing coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These beans are nice, very fragrant and rich," he murmured to himself as he strolled to the window, gazing at the scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire resort was perched on a high cliff, the highest point on the beach, offering a sweeping view of the beautiful surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everywhere he looked, lush greenery and rare blooms surrounded the sprawling resort, blending nature with opulence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, the beach stretched out toward the blue sea, with flocks of seagulls soaring through the sky&mdash;a breathtaking view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rich scent of coffee filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce took out a test strip, placed a few drops of coffee on it, and watched it closely for any reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no lines appear, Joyce nodded in satisfaction and said to Barry, "Mr. Morris, the coffee's fine. No issues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry smiled and patted her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're overly cautious. The Kaylon runs this place. Who would dare poison us here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Morris family has mastered the art of poison for generations. If we're not the best, no one is. Anyone who'd try to poison me is asking for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce's lovely face softened as she spoke with respect. "You are the heir of the Morris family. We may all be masters of poison, but it's still best to be cautious outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing beside them, Diego quickly chimed in, "Yes, indeed. For your safety, we should take every precaution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, you're both very loyal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry smiled and nodded, picking up his coffee cup to enjoy a leisurely sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few sips, he set the cup down and asked Diego again, "Diego, after I kill Alexander, do you think Felix will turn on us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of malice appeared in Diego's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been thinking about that as well. He's not as simple as he appears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's incredibly cunning, adaptable, and hard to handle. Don't be fooled by his submissive act. He needs something from us right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Alexander is dead and the bounty threat is gone, his true colors will show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Felix is biding his time, but if I can kill Alexander, I can kill him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Red Umbrella Group has no level-three metahumans, and I not only have level-three abilities but also over twenty years of martial arts training. Killing him would be like squashing an ant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego frowned, speaking seriously as he cautioned. "We can't be careless. I have a feeling Felix has some kind of trump card."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? What trump card?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was mildly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... I haven't figured it out yet. He hides it well, but sometimes I can sense a bit of killing intent from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego looked a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hehehe</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce laughed flirtatiously, scoffing, "I think Felix is just cunning. If he really had any trump card, would Alexander have him cornered like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, Joyce's right. I think Felix's trump card is probably 'enduring humiliation' and 'patiently biding his time', </span><span>hahaha</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's expression soured, and he glared at Joyce. This scheming woman had long </span><span>tempted his master, and he'd wanted to deal with her for a while but hadn't had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Diego's hostility, Joyce quickly nestled into Barry's arms, casting a challenging look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diego, what are you all fired up for? Are you planning to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego, furious, shouted back, "Shut up! What do you know? Felix definitely has a trump card, and he's far from simple! Who are you to manipulate our master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry slammed his cup onto the table, his voice cold as he scolded, "Diego, Joyce is my woman. How dare you treat her like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling sense of authority filled the room instantly.</span></p></div>
