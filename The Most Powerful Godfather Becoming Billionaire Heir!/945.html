        <h1>Chapter 945 Full of Confidence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're from the Ghost, not some small-time group like Guzman or Felix Vanderbilt. They wouldn't even qualify to join us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> if you don't want to end up dead, you'd better hand over everything we want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's expression darkened&mdash;threatening Alexander here on Treasure Island, in the Brilliant Group's building? They clearly had no respect for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two Ghost operatives, thinking they could pull this off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to hand over this, hand over that, but have you ever stopped to think if you can actually take it from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's words almost made Cynthia explode with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I have no idea what dying feels like, so I'd love it if you Ghost folks could actually make that happen. Think you can manage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're way too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's face twisted, her voice dripping with venom,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost has unmatched power. Even someone like four-star General Quentin Thompson is just a low-level member to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you screwed up the Sakra Society's Apocalypse Project, stalling the immortality serum's development. Our leaders are furious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, hand over everything you have to make up for it, and maybe the higher-ups will let you live. Otherwise, not just you, but everyone around you will pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's threat made Alexander's rage flare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Alexander had done was for his loved ones, to keep them safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia's words were like twisting a knife in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put on a cold </span><span>smile,</span><span> his eyes filled with menace. "Heh, right now, I don't want to kill you. After the auction's over, I'll deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man beside Cynthia suddenly grinned. "I'll make you beg for mercy later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were full of murderous intent, and his cruel smile was chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sized him up, his All-seeing eyes seeing right through the man's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was a master of sneak attacks with hidden weapons&mdash;his sleeves were rigged with devices filled with tiny black poison needles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The poison smelled just like the powder Cynthia had tried to use on Alexander earlier&mdash;absolutely vicious stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cynthia let out a smug laugh,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you really think you're untouchable, but you're already poisoned, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here for a few auction items myself. When it's all over, you'll see what the Ghost can do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just some nobody who got a bit of cash and power, thinking you can take on the Ghost? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't be bothered to respond&mdash;he just kicked back, crossing his legs, waiting for the auction to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe leaned in close, whispering in his ear, her voice worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, are you really poisoned? Should I call someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander so relaxed, with nothing seeming out of the ordinary, Cloe started to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the name "the Ghost" still weighed heavily on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I've got this. Leave it all to me, we'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's confidence was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe still felt uneasy. Those two were from the Ghost, and besides using poison, who knew what else they had up their sleeves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she trusted Alexander's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This auction organized by the Brilliant Group had some truly rare items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Treasure Island was outside the law, it had treasures you wouldn't even find on the black market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alexander's reforms, Treasure Island had become the most trustworthy black market in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many powerful figures wanted to buy and sell discreetly, so they turned to Treasure Island's auctions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commissions collected recently were astronomical&mdash;that was why the Ghost had set their sights on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the auction officially began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer stepped up, announcing the rules loudly before signaling the staff to present the first item.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, our first lot today&mdash;five million tons of wheat from a major grain trader. Starting price&mdash;five billion dollars, with minimum increments of ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, the crowd erupted into chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander raised an eyebrow, surprised at how bold the auction had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five million tons of wheat&mdash;that was more than some small countries produced in a year.</span></p></div>
