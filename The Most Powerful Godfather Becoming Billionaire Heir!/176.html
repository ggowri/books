        <h1>Chapter 176 Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hundred yards away, a sleek Maybach </span><span>parked</span><span> by the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David, peering through binoculars, was entertained, laughing heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Alexander, you think you can take me on? Today's the day I get to watch you fall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander turned to the driver. "You keep Ms. Blackburn safe. I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you can take them on alone?" Ava asked, gripping his arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, his gaze steady, "Don't worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They may be numerous, but to me, they're just a herd of sheep. No matter how many there are, a lion isn't afraid of a flock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he bolted into the fray like a predator on the hunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first targets were the gunmen wielding submachine guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved like a striking cheetah, the air filled with the sounds of gunfire, screams, and the sickening crunch of bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the gunmen fell, with a few managing to fire off wild shots before they met their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> crew had lost over a dozen men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> forces were numerous, and soon Alexander found himself surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blades and metal pipes rained down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, no matter how tough you think you are, I'm going to break every bone in your body today!" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> sneered</span><span> with</span><span> confidence</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden explosion of noise erupted as a group of </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> men collapsed, seven or eight of them hitting the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte</span><span> dove for cover, his heart racing. "Does he have grenades or something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile vanished, replaced by a look of sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slammed his fist into the ground, creating a deep crater in the hard earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Debris flew everywhere, sending the surrounding men reeling in blood and chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two powerful punches, Alexander incapacitated over twenty of </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one that fell bore the marks of violence&mdash;bullet holes, shattered limbs, or worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute of fighting, </span><span>Houtte's</span><span> fifty-plus men dwindled to just a handful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was soaked with blood, bodies sprawled in grotesque positions, and weapons littered the scene like a battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific sight sent shockwaves through the remaining fighters, forcing them to retreat in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, calm and collected, strode toward </span><span>Houtte</span><span> as if he were taking a leisurely stroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thug circled around behind him, brandishing a machete and charging in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander, as if sensing the attack, didn't even turn around. He pivoted and delivered a powerful kick, sending the attacker flying, then continued </span><span>to approach</span><span> </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, whose face went pale</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every</span><span> Cripple member who dared to intervene found themselves screaming as they crumpled at Alexander's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Houtte's</span><span> legs trembled uncontrollably. He had heard of Alexander's prowess but never imagined it would be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had witnessed countless gang wars, but none compared to the sheer brutality unfolding before him today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, unarmed, had already taken down more than forty of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few remaining were nothing more than frightened rabbits, either cowering or desperately trying to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This experience was utterly mind-blowing for </span><span>Houtte</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this guy even human?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava watched in stunned silence, her mouth agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her once-pale, exquisite face flushed. She was mesmerized by Alexander's prowess. He was simply stunning in his ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for </span><span>Houtte</span><span>, the charming figure of Alexander was now the </span><span>sign</span><span> of death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever kills him, I'll pay 10 million dollars!" </span><span>Houtte</span><span> shouted, his voice shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the reward was great, courage often followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation fueled his men, who suddenly seemed to be on steroids, raising their weapons and charging at Alexander with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others scrambled to grab blood-soaked submachine guns, unleashing a hail of bullets in his direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power of the Force enhancing him, Alexander moved with such velocity that he became little more than a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he evade bullets, but he glided through the chaos in the crowd like a wraith, leaving no one able to touch him. Despairing screams erupted around him, and the sounds of bodies hitting the ground rang out in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David, watching the horrific scene through his binoculars, felt his entire body tremble in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, David caught a glimpse of Alexander turning and flashing a grin directly at him through the lens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, David thought it might just be a trick of the light, but there was no mistaking it&mdash;Alexander was genuinely smiling at him, as if their eyes were locked across the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he see me from this far away? That's impossible!" Panic surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The binoculars slipped from David's trembling hands and clattered to the ground as he stumbled backward, racing toward his ca</span><span>r.</span></p></div>
