        <h1>Chapter 1136 Rain of Stones</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">At the same moment, Alexander heard the gunfire.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Though he was still several miles away from the food factory, his sharp instincts immediately kicked in.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He slammed on the brakes. The car screeched to a halt, the tires burning against the road as a faint smell of burnt rubber filled the air.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander sat still for a moment, channeling the Force to sharpen his senses.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, his ears twitched. He caught the faint sound of engines, several cars speeding eastward.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without wasting a second, he shifted into gear and sped off, taking a shortcut to cut them off.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Within minutes, he spotted three black SUVs racing down the road.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He floored the pedal, weaving through the shortcut to block their path.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He got out of the car, casually scooping up a handful of small stones from the roadside. He held them in his hand, weighing them carefully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Each stone was coated with the Force. The moment they were launched, the force behind them would be as devastating as a sniper bullet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smirked. &quot;You think you can escape, Sakra Society? Not a chance.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The roar of the engines grew louder as the SUVs neared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander stood in the middle of the road his gaze laser-focused on the first SUV.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Inside, Tyler was jamming to loud rock music while slamming the pedal to the floor. The engine roared to life, pushing the vehicle forward at over 100 miles per hour like a dragon tearing through the dark.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler had the window down, letting the cool night air rush in as he reveled in the speed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But beneath the thrill, his frustration simmered. His time in Loscity had been nothing but a series of failures. The poison he&#x27;d slipped into Gavin&#x27;s drink had seemed like a success at first, but in the end, it didn&#x27;t work.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, he&#x27;d tried to get close to Xavier, hoping to control him, but that mission had fallen apart, too.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His final plan had been to ambush Ultimate Alliance&#x27;s convoy and destroy it. But once again, things had gone terribly wrong.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not only had they failed to harm Ultimate Alliance, but they had lost half their men. Now, he was down to just a handful of survivors.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For someone like Tyler, that was a huge blow to his pride.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Damn it!&quot; He slammed his fist on the steering wheel, cursing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sir, are we really just leaving?&quot; a big man sitting in the passenger seat asked, his voice laced with frustration.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler glanced at him with a cold look and snorted, &quot;What do you want to do? Stay here and wait to be caught? Don&#x27;t underestimate Ultimate Alliance. If we stay at the factory, they&#x27;ll track us down in no time. And we won&#x27;t be able to get away.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The big man hesitated, stammering, &quot;But we didn&#x27;t complete the mission... What if Mr. White punishes us when we get back?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll take the blame. What we&#x27;re really short on in Sakra Society is talent. He won&#x27;t kill us,&quot; Tyler said with a dismissive sneer.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But it wasn&#x27;t just the big man who was nervous. The others in the back seats and the two SUVs trailing behind were all on edge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The drive continued smoothly, and slowly, Tyler began to feel a sense of relief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With one hand on the wheel, he lit a cigarette with the other, taking a deep drag. The smoke filled his lungs, and he let out a satisfied exhale.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;There is someone ahead?&quot; the big man suddenly shouted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler squinted ahead. There were headlights visible at the intersection.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Stop freaking out. It&#x27;s probably just a passing car,&quot; Tyler scoffed, taking another drag of his cigarette.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As they rounded the bend, they saw Alexander standing in the middle of the road, a calm smile on his face as he waved at them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Shit! It&#x27;s Alexander! How did he get here?!&quot; Tyler&#x27;s face went pale, his heart skipping a beat. It was as if he&#x27;d been struck by lightning. In an instant, he flicked the cigarette out the window.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before he could react, Alexander raised his hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With a sharp crack, the window shattered, and Tyler felt a searing pain in his chest. He couldn&#x27;t hold onto the steering wheel anymore.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The car veered off the road, crashing down from several meters in the air before tumbling down a slope.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tyler felt weightless as he was thrown around like a ragdoll, the vehicle spinning uncontrollably.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander raised his hand again. A stone whizzed through the air, striking the second SUV&#x27;s driver in the head. The vehicle swerved and crashed head-on into the third SUV.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Inside, screams erupted as people scrambled to escape, but they were met with a rain of stones, each one exploding their skulls with brutal precision.</p></div>
