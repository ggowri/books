        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chisel moved like a serpent, winding over the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the final </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern was being etched, Alexander felt the Force within him completely drain away, leaving him feeling incredibly empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he going to fail again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashes of images raced through his mind&mdash;his daughter Ashley, Ava, and so many beautiful women, along with his friends, all needing his protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, the sly and treacherous adversary, filled Alexander with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need powerful strength. I need a Lightsabers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden bite of his tongue, clarity surged through his chaotic thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last remnants of the Force inside him concentrated at the tip of the chisel as he made his final cut into the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous sound echoed in his head, and a sharp pain shot through him as he collapsed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the result of overextending himself&mdash;he was utterly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to lift his head to look at the gemstone on the table, which now emitted a faint yellow glow, pure and bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his amazement, the top-quality yellow gemstone began to float, hovering gently in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surface of the gemstone flickered with golden, intricate patterns&mdash;one hundred and ten in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Energy Convergence Matrix was finally complete. Although this yellow gemstone wasn't the top-tier one he needed to use as an energy core for the Lightsabers, it would serve as an excellent talisman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to gift it to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with joy, Alexander realized that with this experience, once he fully restored his Force, he could carve the top-quality gemstone into the energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creating the Lightsabers would follow naturally; he had already prepared the mithril, fine gold, and meteoric iron needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed now was to restore his Force to its peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rosalia rushed in, urgently wrapping her arms around Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, just a bit worn out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the remarkable softness of Rosalia's body against him and chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he relied on meditation to restore his Force, but now he found greater success through beautiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They not only helped him recover his Force but could also absorb the Force of James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed Rosalia against the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gasped, a mixture of surprise and delight flooding her. Without hesitation, she leaned forward, her round backside raised enticingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, she wore a tight black training suit that clung to her alluring curves, crafted from sheer silk, easily torn apart by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rounded, creamy backside shimmered under the lights, exuding an alluring glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of sweet, feminine fragrance enveloped him, and Alexander couldn't help but swallow hard with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He playfully slapped Rosalia's backside, causing it to ripple delightfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia felt a rush of tingles all over her body and turned to look at Alexander, her eyes filled with anticipation and desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unzipped his pants, revealing his fierce desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia gasped, looking at him with a seductive gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved this position; it was thrilling and made her feel completely consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He braced himself, ready to restore his Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, please go slow, gently..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite not being new to this, the pressure from his fierce desire filled her with both excitement and apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, you're the strongest among my women; if you can't handle it, that would be disappointing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and kneaded her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia shot him a playful glare. "Master, your desire is terrifying! I dare say no </span><span>woman could handle it alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander feigned ignorance, filled with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Andrew has already been taken to the police station by Charlize. Please, love me well, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia pleaded, her eyes shimmering with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander suddenly heard soft footsteps outside, clearly indicating that Charlize had returned.</span></p></div>
