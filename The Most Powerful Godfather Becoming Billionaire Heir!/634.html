        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled. "Excellent! Keep it up, Augusta. I want to see your ultimate werewolf form."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!" Augusta replied, even more thrilled to receive Alexander's praise and </span><span>encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "Boss, I suspect Felix hasn't just come to Treasure Island; he's also allied with the City of Sorcery and is preparing to battle Cloe's Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Red Umbrella Group in disarray, he needs to absorb the Brilliant Group to stabilize his power. Felix even aims to expand his influence, not just to Treasure Island but across all the islands in the bay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's expression was very serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Felix!" Alexander exclaimed, rage surging within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was like a cancer; as long as he remained alive, he would continue to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliminating him was the only way Alexander could fully claim his position as the sole heir to the Godfather's legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Red Umbrella Group swallowed up the Brilliant Group and dominated Treasure Island, it would lead to catastrophic consequences for the surrounding islands and cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thunderous noise echoed from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Red Umbrella Group is constructing a magic circle! It's said that this magic circle was developed by Rock from the City of Sorcery using ancient texts. It can unleash terrifying powers," Augusta informed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of magic circle? Take me there!" Alexander commanded, eager to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the cover of darkness, Augusta moved swiftly, blending into the night as he advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, a large structure came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of buildings surrounded a vast, well-lit square; this was the Red Umbrella Group's headquarters on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A perimeter of several miles was controlled by the Red Umbrella Group, while the Brilliant Group occupied the rest, effectively encircling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! Rock got something skills!" Alexander remarked as he observed through the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of multi-colored pillars stood erect in the expansive square, each adorned with grotesque patterns of birds and beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These pillars were not placed randomly; they were meticulously arranged according to specific criteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When connected, they formed a massive pentagram magic circle, complete with an inverted cross and a sheep skull at its center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could vaguely sense that this formation, which represented the summoning of a devil, had the capability to continuously draw power from the island and sea, enhancing their combat strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could even manipulate luck&mdash;though luck might seem abstract, its existence was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like in a casino, where some patrons won, and others lost, luck played a crucial role.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this magic circle was fully operational, it would bolster the Red Umbrella </span><span>Group's capabilities and improve its fortunes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having the Ultimate Legacy, which contained records of ancient witchcraft and magic circles, allowed Alexander to discern the potential of this formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from a distance through the screen, he felt a sense of dread welling up in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander confirmed that this magic circle was incomplete. It looked incredibly powerful, but it was far from its full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Alexander muttering to himself, Augusta asked in confusion, "Boss, is this magic circle really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, and his expression solemn, "Yeah, it's incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they complete this magic circle, Felix will appear. He'll be blessed with the power of the circle, which is an absolutely terrifying force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander already felt a vague sense of mental pressure through the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to be at the scene in person, the pressure would likely be even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, multiple heavy machines and vehicles buzzed around the square, creating a cacophony of noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of workers toiled through the night amidst a sea of construction equipment&mdash;marble, steel bars, cement, glimmering metal blocks, granite, and more surrounded the area.</span></p></div>
