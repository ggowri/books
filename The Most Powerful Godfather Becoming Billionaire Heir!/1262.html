        <h1>Chapter 1262 An Unexpected Gain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we'll all go to Treasure Island. My father has over a dozen cargo ships at other ports. We can send them all there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart leaped with joy. He hadn't expected to gain an entire transport fleet just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chapmans were an old shipping family. Having both Karson and his daughter on board would be a huge asset for Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karson stepped forward, his expression complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you've done so much for the Chapman family. We're truly grateful," he said. "The world has gone mad, but I believe Treasure Island will be our last paradise. We want to be part of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent. On behalf of Treasure Island, I welcome you all," Alexander replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men clasped hands firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Norah and Karson began recruiting others who were willing to relocate to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the survivors were workers from Louvian Port. Many had lost their families and were now alone, making them eager for the chance to start fresh on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they gathered the bodies of those who didn't make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood silently beside their fallen comrades. Tears flowed freely as muffled sobs broke the heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people who died in the beast tide were someone's family, someone's friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have predicted this disaster would strike so suddenly. They had sacrificed their lives fighting against the monster horde, their bodies now cold and broken, most of them torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Family members of the deceased broke down in tears, filling the air with grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ordered Augusta to retrieve the Mutated Monkey King's corpse. After a thorough search, they discovered a walnut-sized black crystal embedded in its mangled head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Augusta placed the crystal in Alexander's hand, he could hardly believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his fingers touched it, he knew exactly what it was&mdash;a low-level energy core, the exact material needed to upgrade his Lightsabers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To upgrade a Lightsaber to level four, he needed ten low-level energy cores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had been searching everywhere for clues about these cores, with no luck understanding what they even were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never would have guessed they'd find one inside the Mutated Monkey King's brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully cleaned the crystal, his heart racing with excitement. This was an unexpected stroke of luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, strangely enough, he realized that Yinson unleashing this monster disaster had somehow worked in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of more mutant beasts showing up actually lifted Alexander's spirits. Just ten more low-level energy cores and he could upgrade his Lightsabers to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Alexander led everyone in a simple memorial service, firing their weapons into the air in tribute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshots echoed through the air, accompanied by fresh waves of tears from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the ceremony, Karson stepped forward and raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who wants to join me on Treasure Island, let's move out!" he called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had repaired a ship and were setting sail for Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched the ship grow smaller on the horizon. Norah stood at the bow, waving goodbye with visible reluctance. The sight stirred up mixed emotions in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trip to Louvian Port had definitely been worth it. Not only had he saved many lives, but he'd also secured a fleet from the Chapman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Better still, he'd found a low-level energy core!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Alexander made it home, evening had fallen. To his surprise, his whole family was waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he opened the door, Ava wrapped him in a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, I love you!" Ashley came running, latching onto Alexander's leg with pure joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's my sweet girl!"</span><span> </span><span>Alexander laughed happily, scooping his daughter into his arms and peppering her cheeks with kisses until she burst into giggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn and Lily were there too, both beaming at Alexander with the tender, caring looks that only mothers could give.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Ava was preparing for her trip to Treasure Island, she'd invited Lily over so they could leave together later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's heart felt full. Having his whole family waiting for him at home&mdash;nothing could beat this feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Ava and Lily headed to the kitchen to fix dinner, Alexander stayed in the living room playing with Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley, thoughtful as she was, kept bringing him snacks and fruit. Alexander munched away contentedly while keeping her entertained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help noticing how much Ashley had grown lately. She was becoming more adorable by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her new haircut fell just to her ears, with a cute fringe framing her face. She had adorable chubby cheeks, and always kept a lollipop in her mouth. Her big round eyes sparkled with mischief.</span></p></div>
