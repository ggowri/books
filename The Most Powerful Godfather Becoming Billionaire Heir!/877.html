        <h1>Chapter 877 There's a Shark!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Alexander used the Force to see through the water and cast his fishing rod, reeling in the massive fish in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Alexander cast the fishing rod again, but without using the Force or his vision. He relied on bait and waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others carried the tuna away, leaving the deck quiet. Only Alexander and Norma remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fresh sea breeze swept through Norma's hair and light chiffon wrap, her graceful figure appearing ethereal, like a goddess about to take flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lightly touched Alexander's bare chest and laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you're in such great shape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma picked up sunscreen and gently applied it to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate fingers brushed against his chest, back, and arms... It was incredibly soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a few attendants brought a small table onto the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was laden with dishes: tuna sashimi, grilled fish, savory fish soup, and fresh salad, all mouthwateringly aromatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sparkling waves, the luxury yacht, fine food and drink, and Norma's breathtaking presence, Alexander felt like a true winner in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the meal, Alexander and Norma rested for a while before going for a dive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were captivated by the beauty of the underwater world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vibrant corals, schools of colorful fish, scuttling crabs, and unhurried turtles created a scene straight out of a fairytale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Norma's first-time diving. Amid the stunning and dreamlike underwater scenery, she felt a mix of awe and nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Alexander by her side, Norma felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stayed close behind him, her heart brimming with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding her hand, Alexander couldn't help but admit that Norma was truly stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crystal-clear waters, Norma's diving suit hugged her flawless figure like a sultry mermaid moving gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! A shark!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Norma froze in fear, her eyes wide, and grabbed Alexander, frantically swimming toward the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive tiger shark charged at them, its jaws gaping to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiger sharks were vicious predators known for attacking humans, responsible for most shark-related injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander and Norma were ordinary people, there would be no doubt&mdash;they'd be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled Norma behind him and launched himself like a torpedo toward the tiger shark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the tiger shark's massive jaws were about to close around him, Alexander dodged nimbly, causing it to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of the moment, Alexander delivered a powerful kick to the shark's head, using the Force to shatter its skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiger shark rolled backward several meters as the water around it turned a deep red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gaping hole in its head gushed torrents of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its lifeless body floated toward the surface, leaving a blood-stained sea in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiger sharks moved in packs, earning them the nickname "wolves of the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the heavy scent of blood began to attract other tiger sharks from kilometers away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Norma hadn't noticed the other sharks yet, Alexander had already spotted over a dozen tiger sharks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hear panicked screams from the yacht, confirming that the shark pack had been noticed there as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glared at the yacht's smirking </span><span>pilot,</span><span> his eyes filled with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tiger shark hadn't appeared by chance. Someone had dumped bloody bait into the water while they were diving, luring the shark to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yacht pilot had planned to kill them using the sharks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Norma by the waist and unleashed the Force, propelling them forward at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The immense power made him shoot toward the surface like a launched arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified moments ago, Norma felt reassured in his arms and clung to Alexander tightly, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding each other close, they rapidly rose to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, over a dozen tiger sharks swarmed from all directions, drawn by the scent of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was horrifying yet strangely breathtaking.</span></p></div>
