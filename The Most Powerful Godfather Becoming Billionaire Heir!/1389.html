        <h1>Chapter 1389 Shameless</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's&nbsp;face was glowing with excitement as he eagerly reported his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I've already secured several dozen acres of land. I've built glass-tiled greenhouses and bought seedlings and equipment from&nbsp;Hall of Lives. I plan to start with&nbsp;fleeceflower root."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted him on the shoulder. "Not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, his expression turning serious as he spoke slowly, "I gathered you all here today to tell you&mdash;I'm joining the imperial army on the campaign to&nbsp;Xhantao! While I'm gone, you must stay on high alert, especially around&nbsp;Josh's&nbsp;territory.&nbsp;Vegeta, I want you stationed at&nbsp;Sacred Spirit Gang. I have a feeling something big will happen there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the others had left,&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;looked anxious. "Alexander, are you really enlisting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes flashed coldly. His tone was firm and unwavering. "To break through the limits of martial arts, there is no turning back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, be careful. If anything happens, retreat to&nbsp;Dominion Church."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Alexander. I'm a&nbsp;Hall of Lives&nbsp;client now. No one would dare touch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, the trade fair was jointly hosted by the&nbsp;Outer Court of Dominion Church&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Hrodvik Empire. Participants included&nbsp;Dragon Sect, Elite School, Iron Vanguard, Four Seas Guild, Pacific Trading Coalition, and many more...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire arena was packed with people, shoulder to shoulder. There were&nbsp;Outer Court&nbsp;disciples, imperial officers ranked&nbsp;captain&nbsp;and above, as well as representatives from various trade guilds, martial halls, and escort agencies, all gathered to enlist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast square was filled with densely packed stalls and fluttering banners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Why are there&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;here at the trade fair? Aren't we about to go to war with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know? The&nbsp;Pacific Trading Coalition, which is&nbsp;Risunese is putting up both money and resources, publicly condemning&nbsp;Risun&nbsp;for attacking a vassal state of the empire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't that make them traitors to their own country? Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crowd gathered around the&nbsp;Pacific Trading Coalition stall. The&nbsp;Risunese&nbsp;merchants there showed no shame&mdash;in fact, they seemed rather proud of themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed inwardly.&nbsp;If the&nbsp;Hrodvik Empire&nbsp;were truly strong, there would be no traitors. No one would look to foreign powers with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander wandered through the stalls, he quickly got a sense of things. The best goods came from&nbsp;Dominion Church, followed by those from the&nbsp;imperial court.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest would be considered high-quality anywhere else, but here, they were second-rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to check out what the&nbsp;Outer Court's&nbsp;marketplace had to offer. At the center of the arena stood several long wooden platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Multi-colored&nbsp;protective energy barriers&nbsp;shimmered above the platforms, displaying a variety of goods inside. A large crowd had gathered to browse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, two arched gateways&mdash;one large, one small&mdash;shimmered like rippling water. Several&nbsp;priest guards&nbsp;stood watch, while a middle-aged scholar sat behind a large&nbsp;nanmu&nbsp;wood table, accompanied by a few attendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar had a powerful aura. He was at least a&nbsp;level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was stunned. A fighter of this caliber was working as a&nbsp;gatekeeper? Curious, he walked over and asked, "What's this entrance for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's impressive demeanor, the scholar didn't dare be disrespectful. He stood up and bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an auction jointly hosted by the Hrodvik Business Alliance and the Hrodvik Treasury. Entry requires a silver waist badge from the Dominion Church's Outer Court or a military rank of lieutenant or higher, along with a 1,000 silver coin fee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand&nbsp;silver coins&nbsp;wasn't much, but right now, he only had half a chest of jewels...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander made up his mind and asked the scholar, "Can I use jewelry and jade as payment instead of silver?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar chuckled. "Of course, we&nbsp;accept jewelry and jade, but there will be a slight depreciation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calculated quickly&mdash;probably about a 10% markdown. That wasn't a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his&nbsp;Dimensional pouch, pulled out his&nbsp;silver waist badge, and placed a large&nbsp;nanmu&nbsp;wood chest on the table. When he lifted the lid, a dazzling display of gems and gold shone brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar's eyes lit up when he saw the&nbsp;Dimensional pouch, but when the chest was opened, he was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir... this... we'll need a moment to appraise this properly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. Take your time," Alexander said with a casual smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked to himself.&nbsp;Money really does make the world go round&mdash;even my title just changed to 'sir.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar bowed slightly. "If you trust us, sir, you may enter the auction first. Within half an hour, your&nbsp;silver notes&nbsp;will be delivered to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. There was no reason to doubt any transaction within&nbsp;Dominion Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;Hrodvik Trade Alliance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hrodvik Treasury&nbsp;had business spread across the entire&nbsp;Sahasia Continent. His wealth was just a drop in the ocean&mdash;it wasn't worth them risking their reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scholar quickly instructed one of the attendants, "Escort the gentleman to the VIP section."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attendant immediately bowed and respectfully led Alexander through the larger of the two&nbsp;shimmering archways.</span></p></div>
