        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first-class seats were in pairs, with Madelyn seated by the window and Alexander by the aisle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's guards were storing luggage and then took seats behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Walter, what kind of skills does this Alexander guy even have? Do we really need to serve him like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One guard complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, Walter, with striking blue eyes, sighed and replied, "Don't say that. It's an order, and we have to follow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guard could only sit down, pouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcos boarded the plane in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seat was in the same row as Alexander, just across the aisle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos stared at Madelyn, taking in her graceful figure, alluring charm, and long, beautiful legs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but swallow, taking a couple of gulps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Marcos, but the men around were all </span><span>focused on</span><span> Madelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though several other women in the area were also attractive, besides Madelyn, </span><span>they seemed like mere stars beside the moon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos wasn't just a popular singer in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>; his father was one of the biggest drug lords there, and he'd been with many models and actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn's looks and figure rivaled any </span><span>celebrity's</span><span>, and she had an even more sophisticated aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos couldn't help but imagine spending a wonderful night with this beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe he'd met such a stunning woman while passing through </span><span>Loscity</span><span>&mdash;he couldn't miss this chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his status and confidence, he felt sure he could easily win over this beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alexander sitting beside her, he didn't consider him a competitor at all&mdash;what threat could this nobody </span><span>pose</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos walked over, smiling, and asked, "Lovely lady, may I sit here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander without caring whether Alexander wanted to switch seats or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn gave him an icy look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos immediately pulled out a stack of dollars and tossed it at Alexander, sneering. "Take this money and go sit somewhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless&mdash;this guy was unbelievably rude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Madelyn grew furious. "What do you mean? Do you think money makes you superior? Who cares about your filthy cash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was taken aback, his confidence shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, I'm the famous singer Marcos from </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>. My father is Caleb; </span><span>surely</span><span> you've heard of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even tried to suavely brush his hair back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know you, now go away. I have absolutely no interest in you; stop bothering us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn picked up the money thrown at Alexander and tossed it back at Marcos with a hard glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept a smile throughout, watching Marcos get humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted at the scene as everyone mocked Marcos' arrogance and incompetence, and Marcos immediately became enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, don't you think that was a bit much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos attempted to grab Madelyn's shoulder, but Alexander intercepted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't harass my friend again, or I won't be so polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos glared at Alexander in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's attire was ordinary, and in terms of status, he surely couldn't compare to Marcos, who quickly regained some confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, you're really pushing it. Give up your seat now, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression grew stern; this shameless guy just wouldn't stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf? I told you to get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos actually raised his arm, aiming a slap at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter leaped up, ready to assist, but Alexander had already seized Marcos' hand, </span><span>immobilizing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what are you doing? Let go... it hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos cried out, feeling his hand clamped like an iron vice, growing tighter and tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow! Let go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, his pleas were abruptly cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed him by the neck and lifted him into the air like a hawk clutching a chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos' face quickly darkened, his eyes nearly popping out.</span></p></div>
