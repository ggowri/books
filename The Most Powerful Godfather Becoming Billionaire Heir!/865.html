        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked up to Sean with a smile and looked down at him, his eyes as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What...what do you want to do? Please...don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean was so scared that he lay on the ground, begging like a dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander grabbed his neck and lifted him like an eagle catching a chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! No... Don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean struggled desperately, like a fish thrown onto the shore, flapping hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander's fingers did not loosen at all but instead became tighter and tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sean's face turned pale due to a severe lack of oxygen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's tone was so matter-of-fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a crisp sound of bones cracking, and Sean's cervical vertebra was broken, and his eyes rolled back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only when his face turned black, and his body twitched uncontrollably did Alexander calmly throw his body to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin knelt beside him, watching the scene quietly, shaking uncontrollably because of his fear of the man in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander walked up to him and looked at Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost a hand, and his gambling skills dwindled. Typically, he was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was mentally controlled by Alexander and was considered a loyal person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said coldly, "I will let you be a supervisor in the casino. You must do your job honestly and report any abnormal situation in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you! Thank you for your mercy, Master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin prostrated himself on the ground in gratitude, not daring to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not that Alexander didn't trust Norma but that he never took risks. He must place more of his own people in the Dragon Gang to grasp the situation of the gang accurately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to Benjamin, there was also Keith, and they were all his pawns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, noisy footsteps were heard in the corridor outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Norma rushed in with a group of people, she saw Sean lying on the ground. His face was black, foaming at the mouth, and his body stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early the following day, Keith, still in an excited state, had set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to arrive at Dragon Film and Television Company on time before eight o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must be on time on my first day at work. Don't be late! I will be the best actor in the future. The top ten porn actresses will all be my slaves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! Why are there so many people today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith arrived downstairs of the building and immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The streets and open spaces around the building were all filled with parked cars. A group of burly men wearing the same black uniform, headphones, and sunglasses were guarding the building vigilantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the first time that Keith saw such a large scene, and he felt a little uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Black-clad guards obstructed him at the gate as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith, palms sweating with nerves, swiftly presented the work certificate he had received yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hands trembled as he handed over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After carefully checking his certificate, the other party's cold expression finally softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You may go in now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith took the certificate, bowed, and thanked him quickly, then let out a long breath and walked quickly into the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a group of journalists swarmed in but were ruthlessly stopped by the men in black, and several of them were even pushed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chaos erupted, leaving journalists unable to advance, all being ushered out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith looked back at all this and couldn't help but smile smugly, feeling a sense of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Master. It is you who gave me all this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured it gratefully and then leisurely walked to the fifth floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the second floor to the twentieth floor, it was the office area of Heilong Film and Television, including a large number of live-action photo studios.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half of global porn films were filmed here, with hundreds produced daily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was like a country boy coming to the city, curious about everything he saw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked around, followed the signs, and reported to the human resources department of the company.</span></p></div>
