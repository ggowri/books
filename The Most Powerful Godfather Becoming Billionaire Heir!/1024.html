        <h1>Chapter 1024 Break the Poison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's smile faded, and her expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong? Is your family really the kind to repay kindness with ingratitude?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai's face twisted in distress, and he quickly explained, "Ms. Blackburn, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant! This is a very difficult decision. I need to consult with my mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava frowned. It seemed that Malakai really had his reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew Malakai was a dutiful son, and his mother was a business genius in her own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without her, the Nexura Group wouldn't be where it was today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai stepped into the hallway, dialing his phone and pacing nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, yes... you're right..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded while rubbing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava, perplexed, couldn't help but wonder why Malakai was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the call ended, Malakai's face was clouded with a feeling of deep sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he turned to Ava, his voice low and filled with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I just spoke to my mother. We will continue our cooperation with you, and we'll supply materials at even better prices."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Really? Not only will you resume the supply, but at a discounted rate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's face lit up with joy. The situation had taken a complete turn, and she was finally at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I apologize for the disturbance, Ms. Blackburn. Please extend our family's respects to Godfather. If possible, we would like to meet him in person to express our gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava didn't know how to answer. After all, she couldn't make decisions regarding Godfather on her own. She would have to consult with Alexander first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Ava remain silent, Malakai thought she was still unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With determination, he said, "From now on, the Nexura Group will provide materials at a 20% discount."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A 20% discount?" Ava was stunned by this good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her excitement was barely contained. After all, the money saved would be a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, it's too much. After all, the Nexura Group needs to make a profit, too. As for your visit to the Godfather, I'll definitely report that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relieved by her response, Malakai exhaled but still looked troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona suddenly burst into tears, wailing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Malakai, if we go against their orders, what will happen to our son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we don't follow the Vanderbilt family's instructions, our son will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My poor son... he has just turned five... What will we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doctor said I can't have another child... If anything happens to our son, I won't be able to live with myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona clung to Malakai, sobbing desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, I'm sorry to let you see this. The Vanderbilt family in Capital Region is threatening me. They want me to stop supplying materials. They want revenge on you. If I don't comply, my son's poison will trigger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai sighed and his gaze was heavy with sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava finally understood. It was Felix's family behind this, threatening Malakai and Ramona from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were forcing them to stop supplying materials, or their son might die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava's expression softened. "I can find someone to help your son. The poison won't be a problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai's eyes widened with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, who are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai suddenly bowed to Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Valdez, please! I'll definitely help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava hurried to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona bowed to her as well, crying as she begged,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn, please help us... We've tried everything. We even went to City of Sorcery, but nothing worked. We had no choice but to comply with the Vanderbilt family's demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Skyla said if I don't stop the supply, she won't save our son... It's all the Vanderbilt family's doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona sobbed as she pleaded, "If you can save our son, we will follow your lead. The Nexura Group will do anything you ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava quickly helped them to their feet and reassured them, "Don't worry, Alexander will help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Malakai's face lit up with joy. "Can Mr. Hawthorne really cure the poison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course. Even Ms. Quinn in City of Sorcery is defeated by him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ava was fully confident in Alexander's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Ava's assurance, Malakai and Ramona were overjoyed.</span></p></div>
