        <h1>Chapter 419 Task</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to sign it? Do you want me to post the video all over the internet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to get high? Only the Red Umbrella Group has this new magic powder, and it's still in pilot production, so you can't even buy it anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix threatened Ella, looking triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to completely shatter Ella's fragile self-esteem with a vicious blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're outrageous and despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella couldn't help but curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stop pretending to be innocent. You were already a slut, and you did everything you've ever wanted in your mind right now, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix wrapped his arms around Ella, restraining her in his embrace, and the two bodies pressed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ella felt the changes in Felix's body, and the desire rose up inside her once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Ella was immediately hypnotized. She was dizzy, and Felix whispered in her ear, "Take a look and feel it. As soon as you're in my arms, you can't help yourself right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's who you are, and you can't get away from my medicine or me, so why don't you sign it? Sign it, and you'll be happy forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella felt drowsy, enjoying Felix's embrace, her consciousness being constantly affected by Felix's words and actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's who I was supposed to be. I can't stop getting high, and I like men. The Red Umbrella Group is so powerful, so why should I resist in vain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Ella had long been in control, and she sank into a world of desire from which she could not extricate herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Ella surrendered. She picked up the pen shakily and signed the agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix watched with satisfaction as she signed her name and focused on her with the camera of his cell phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not enough for you to sign it. You must read this contract out loud in person with no clothes on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No way! I have to put it on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella blushed with shame, and she was now naked completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, however, forced her to start reading, and he looked for a good angle like a photographer and started filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella looked embarrassed as she never said a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix looked a bit angry. "What's wrong? You've already signed it, so do you want to regret it? You need to pay a billion dollars in compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella gritted her teeth as she finally started to read the contract to the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Ella, I volunteer to be Felix's personal assistant. Whenever and wherever he needs me, I will be there in time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. Sure enough, you're a good maid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella finished reading it with tears in her eyes while Felix finished filming it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put the contract in the safe. Then, he took out some money and a silver necklace </span><span>with the number "116" on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you will wear this necklace twenty-four hours a day. If you violate my orders, you will be severely punished. Are we clear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella obediently wore the necklace, and her previous sense of defiance was completely extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix sneered, "You and Alexander are close, aren't you? Now I'm going to give you a task, and I hope you don't do anything wrong because of your personal relationship..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved to Ella's ear and muttered, his eyes showing viciousness every now and then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was so angry that her body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, go back first, and figure out how to finish the task I gave you as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix patted her butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hours had passed since Ella had left the study in a muddle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already in a completely different mood than she had been a few hours ago. She had signed a contract that she couldn't resist and had to follow Felix's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ella still couldn't make up her mind to kidnap Ashley or even bring Ava with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the outfit, Ella had done exactly what Felix had told her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a short and narrow skirt with a tight semi-transparent shirt on the upper half of her body, her perfect figure was vaguely visible.</span></p></div>
