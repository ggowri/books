        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Aren't you right next to me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice reached out and grabbed Alexander's terrifying penis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, do all men like flirty women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded Alice's plump breasts without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I like flirty girls like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I won't talk to you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice glared at him shyly and angrily, then took the initiative to kiss Alexander on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed him behind his ears, chest, lower abdomen, slowly down...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squinted his eyes in comfort, feeling great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alice saw Alexander's expression of enjoyment, she suddenly smiled coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her head, trying hard to please him, drawing circles from time to time with her tongue, sucking and biting, and soon her legs were wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice took off her outer clothes, revealing a pair of sexy black lingerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two small pieces of cloth couldn't cover her plump breasts at all, and she was wearing a thong underneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's nose was filled with the subtle fragrance of Alice's body, which was very stimulating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was busy for a while, and his penis finally reacted strongly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's body tensed up, and a tingling and intense pleasure emanated from his tailbone and spread throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked up at Alexander proudly, then swallowed it with a gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander laughed and said, "You always drink it. Not a bit of it is wasted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are so bad!" Alice felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the taste was strange, Alice didn't mind at all. She had completely devoted her body and soul to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Alice understood what men were thinking. The more a woman obeyed him, the more satisfied he felt. She just wanted to do her best to please Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, it's time for me to serve you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held Alice in his arms and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice groaned softly, and her buttocks swallowed his penis. The two hot bodies pressed tightly together...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was absorbing the Force while having sex with Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was about to go into seclusion to forge Lightsabers, he certainly wanted to keep the Force at its peak, which was why he was so anxious to be with Alice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than an hour later, Alice had collapsed and had completely lost strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please spare me... I can't do it anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice begged, her plump and sexy body fell on the sofa like a puddle of water, unable to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up reluctantly, feeling that his Force had not yet reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize was protecting her daughter, Rosalia wanted to secretly protect Ava, and Alexander couldn't help but think of Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Rebecca officially became the head of the Hansen family, she had been busy, and the two had not seen each other for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately picked up the phone and called Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Rebecca hurried over, trotting to the study, her pretty face flushed, and she was panting slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, do you have anything urgent to talk to me about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and said, "Why? Do I have to find you for something? Nothing, I just miss you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was stunned at first, but then she was overwhelmed with joy and immediately threw herself into Alexander's arms and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I miss you too, but there are too many things to do and the human relationships are very complicated. I haven't dealt with them all yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you tired? Let me help you relax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed Rebecca on the desk, put his hand into her clothes, and started caressing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! No... Ms. Hollister is still outside..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was shy and excited, and her whole body was shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care about all that and just asked her to raise her plump butt high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You reject me, but you're all wet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well! It's all your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca felt so hot and weak all over that she couldn't even stand steadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your breasts are so big and smell so good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved closer, caressing and kissing her greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca couldn't help but sway her fat hips and hummed softly to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out you're also a bitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped her plump butt, making it shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am willing to be your little bitch... I want it, I can't wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Rebecca felt like a huge sword had strung her entire body through...</span></p></div>
