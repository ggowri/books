        <h1>Chapter 968 Lunch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they were kissing, Grace quickly and quietly retreated to the end of the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she deliberately stomped heavily and coughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale and Ave in the kitchen were startled and quickly separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their clothes were messy, and they looked panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace pretended not to notice and asked with a smile, "Dad, Mom, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "I'm making lunch for you, and he is helping me. What are you doing? Go away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave took the opportunity to slap Gale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Get out. It's all your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave pushed Gale, but her coquettish tone sounded sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale didn't mind at all. Instead, he put his hand on Ave's waist and whispered something in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave was amused and started giggling. Then she grabbed Gale's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace was speechless. Her parents loved each other. She also wanted to find a man who could love her. It would be wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but think of Alexander again and suddenly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Dad, don't disturb mom's cooking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale chuckled and finally left the kitchen. Before leaving, he touched Ave's butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Gale, Ave quickly prepared a sumptuous lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, Gavin, Gale, and Ave sat together for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, I heard that Asher came to Loscity to pursue you. Why don't you meet him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave glanced at Grace and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace said helplessly, "Humph! He's not here for me. He's here to help Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I've said it many times. I don't like Asher. I'll find someone I like. Otherwise, I'd rather not get married in this life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong with Asher?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave pouted and wanted to lecture Grace, but she immediately endured it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Gale spoke, "Grace, Asher is a genius in Avalora. He is not only good at martial arts but also proficient in medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He came to Loscity this time not only for the cemetery, but also to treat your grandfather's old injury. He wanted to meet you. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ave quickly echoed, "Asher is a young and promising genius who is proficient in both medicine and martial arts! Regardless of his ability or family background, he is a perfect match for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale said, "Yeah, I think so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded repeatedly. And it was obvious that the couple were very satisfied with Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can Asher heal my injury?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale quickly explained, "Asher found a master to be his teacher and learned some powerful medical skills. You can let him give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace got angry, pushed the food away, stood up, and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Whoever likes Asher can marry him. I won't anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just when Ave was about to get angry, Gale quickly stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Calm down. We can discuss it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's all your fault! You've spoiled Grace!" Ave said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale said, "After all, she is also your daughter. I have to spoil her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale smiled playfully and gently touched her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Gavin was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, why don't you let Asher treat you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale asked Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin hesitated and said, "Okay! Grace's birthday is coming up. We'll hold a party tonight and invite Alexander and Asher to join it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin thought, "No matter if it was Alexander or Asher, as long as the one could heal my old injury, I would support him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, he planned to stand on Alexander's side for the sake of his life and Grace, but now the situation had changed.</span></p></div>
