        <h1>Chapter 114 Took the Act Too Far</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's eyes widened in disbelief, and he slammed his hand down on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you calling a fraud? You better watch your mouth, or I'll have someone break your legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't hold back any longer; he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson barked, his anger simmering, "What's so funny? I've got the magic powder formula right here. Everyone in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> is going to be kissing my feet. You really want to test me? One call, and I could have you wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane chimed in with a sneer, "Alexander, Mr. Gellar could squash you like a bug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't think you were such a lowlife, trying to seduce Felicity while playing Ava's boy toy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew was shaking with rage, practically frothing at the mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, how could you be with him? This has to be Alexander's doing, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I texted Alexander to come and help me because you guys were pushing me!" Felicity protested, shaking her head vigorously as she continued to hide behind Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized that this misunderstanding was going to be impossible to clear up, but he didn't really care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson pretended to pull out his phone, using it as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't get out of here right now, I'll call Sir Stewart from the Kaylon. He'll back me up, and when the Kaylon shows up, you'll wish you were never born. Don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. "You really don't realize you're the joke here, do you? You've taken this act a bit too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth!" Jane shouted, her fury boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but shove Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scumbag! How dare you try to seduce Felicity? Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, Alexander sent Jane sprawling to the side, as if she'd been hit by a car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda were seething, their faces turning a deep shade of red. They looked ready to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, did you see that? Alexander just hit your sister! If you stay with him, you'll end up in an abusive relationship! Are you really going to betray all of us for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane lay on the floor, sobbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felicity, we're only looking out for your future! Mr. Gellar is a hundred times better than this jerk. Why can't you see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the argument reached a fever pitch, the door swung open again, and Oscar strode in with a group of people behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Bistro was a Kaylon property, so Oscar was sure to step in if one of Alexander's friends was in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Stewart! What brings you here?" Andrew exclaimed, his voice a mix of surprise and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane jumped in, saying, "Sir Stewart must know Mr. Gellar is here and has come to pay his respects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, that's got to be it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Belinda nodded vigorously, convinced that only Jackson had the clout to warrant a visit from Oscar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson was momentarily taken aback but then felt a rush of excitement. He hadn't </span><span>expected Oscar from the Kaylon to show up; maybe this was his chance to score big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar, oblivious to the drama unfolding, turned to Alexander. "What's going on here? Do you need my help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively. "It's nothing, just some trash and a fraud. I'll handle it shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a heavy silence, the tension palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's family looked like they'd just been slapped in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felicity's eyes lit up as she exclaimed, "Alexander, so it was you who came through the VIP entrance earlier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's face alternated between red and pale as he was struggling to find the right words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar asked, "Alexander, what's really happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our turf at Astral Bistro, and if I don't treat you right, I'll be embarrassed to face you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, pointing at Jackson. "This fraud is trying to force my ex-wife's sister to be with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar turned to Felicity, who was still hiding behind Alexander, then glanced at Jane's furious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but chuckle. "Didn't expect you to be such a romantic, huh? We've all been young men once; I get it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was at a loss for words. Clearly, Oscar had misinterpreted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Felicity pressed so closely against him, their intimate stance, combined with her title as his ex-wife's sister, certainly painted a suggestive picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar's gaze turned icy as he looked at Jackson. "Who do you think you are? Bullying my buddy Alexander's woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Kaylon crew surged forward, surrounding Jackson like a pack of wolves ready to pounce.</span></p></div>
