        <h1>Chapter 1266 Under Siege</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene outside was horrific. Innocent civilians fled through the streets, only to be caught and torn apart by zombie hordes or swallowed up by waves of mutant beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Oliver most was the living dead were commanding regular zombies, while mutant apes were leading packs of beasts. Instead of fighting each other, they worked together, targeting only normal humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dear God..." Oliver's hands shook as he gripped his gun. "Hell has come to Earth. We've been abandoned by heaven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire grew more intense. Over twenty officers had barricaded the doors and windows with office furniture, firing desperately through the gaps to hold back the approaching horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Melin. Despite the anxiety and tension written across her beautiful face, her hands remained steady as she kept firing, never missing a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people of Loscity's suburbs had dealt with zombie outbreaks before, so they knew the drill&mdash;aim for the head, that was what took them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these mutated beasts were a whole different ball game. They were tough as nails, with thick hides, and moved with a speed and strength that made zombies look like amateurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only silver lining, Melin thought, was that unlike zombies, these creatures still had a survival instinct. They could feel fear, and that meant they could be scared off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door suddenly exploded inward as a massive mutated Cane Corso burst through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thing was more than twice the size of a normal Cane Corso, with a head bigger than a basketball. Its muscles rippled under its hide, razor-sharp claws gleamed, and strings of drool dripped from its massive jaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its blood-red eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger. The once-loyal creature now saw humans as nothing more than prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers opened fire, concentrating their shots on the beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its massive size, the mutated Cane Corso moved with shocking agility, dodging most of the bullets in a single bound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when a few rounds found their mark and drew blood, the monster barely seemed to notice these minor wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood-curdling scream pierced the air. A young officer didn't have time to react before the creature seized him in its massive jaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast treated the full-grown man like a rag doll, shaking him violently from side to side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer blacked out instantly, becoming lifeless prey for the monster's feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific scene paralyzed the remaining officers with fear. Some couldn't handle the terror and pressure, breaking ranks to flee deeper into the station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barricade of desks and chairs they'd set up at the main entrance didn't stand a chance. The mutated Cane Corso smashed through it, opening the floodgates for other mutant beasts and zombies to pour in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers fired desperately at the wave of monsters surging toward them, but their bullets might as well have been raindrops. They were like a tiny boat caught in a storm, fighting against forces that threatened to overwhelm them at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin fired rapidly, her shots taking down three zombies in quick succession, their heads exploding on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around her, her companions were falling one by one as monsters tore into them, ripping them apart in a horrific display of gore and violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a mutated cat&mdash;roughly the size of a small cheetah&mdash;leaped through the air, its blood-stained jaws snapping toward Melin like lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin quickly emptied her magazine at the creature, but it was moving too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only one bullet found its mark, catching the beast in its lower leg and making it stumble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injury only seemed to enrage the mutated cat further. Its blood-red eyes locked onto Melin with a terrifying intensity, as if it wouldn't rest until it had torn her to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an explosive burst of movement, the creature's powerful legs slammed against the concrete floor, its razor-sharp claws leaving deep cracks in the cement. The recoil launched it forward like a cannonball straight at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was moving so fast that Melin could barely track it&mdash;just a blur of motion rushing toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her eyes wide open and her pupils dilated to their limit, she couldn't make out the creature's movements, let alone dodge in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it," she muttered. "I'm done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror gripped Melin's heart. She knew she would meet the same fate as her fallen colleagues&mdash;becoming nothing more than food for these monsters, torn to bloody shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she closed her eyes, accepting death, a familiar figure appeared before her like a ghost, placing himself between her and the creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes locked onto the mutant cat still suspended in mid-air, his gaze filled with fury and contempt.</span></p></div>
