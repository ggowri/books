        <h1>Chapter 1290 Utterly Baffling</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized the substance immediately. It was a surgical anesthetic so potent that just ten milliliters could knock out an elephant. Though he was only a medical intern, he had no doubt about his conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that wasn't all. There was something else mixed in. The liquid gave off a strange, metallic tang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated, gripping the syringe, thinking, "Should I warn the people inside or just pretend I haven't seen anything? Getting involved might only bring me trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief struggle, he made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back and pressed the doorbell hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open again, revealing an astonishingly beautiful woman. She gazed at him with a soft, gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze. She was breathtaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was only slightly shorter than him, her almond-shaped eyes glistening with intelligence. Below her high-bridged nose was a delicate, rosy mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really caught his attention was her figure. The sheer black dress she wore clung to every curve, revealing smooth, pale skin and a dangerously low neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit him that this woman looked exactly like Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile faded as she furrowed her brows and crossed her arms over her chest. In a flat tone, she asked, "Can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That cold, distant demeanor only made her more alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still hadn't said a word. The woman's expression grew wary. She placed a hand near the call button by the door. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an upscale neighborhood with tight security. If she pressed that button, guards would arrive within five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of his daze, Alexander quickly held up the syringe. "My name is Alexander Hawthorne. I just saw your friend drug the wine. I thought you should know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drugged?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, studying him intently. "Are you sure? You saw it happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silvia, who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice called out from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman from earlier, Maris, appeared in the doorway. The moment she spotted Alexander and the syringe in his hand, her expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia Hewitt, the stunning woman, caught the shift in Maris' demeanor. Her gaze darkened. "This delivery guy says he saw you spike the wine. Do you have anything to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! That's ridiculous!" Maris gasped, covering her mouth in shock. "Why would I ever do something like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had to admit, her acting was impressive. She could have given professional actresses a run for their money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silvia, this creep was ogling me earlier. He must want to do something to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris hurriedly stepped in front of her friend as if to shield her. "You don't have to be afraid. I'll protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia visibly relaxed. She trusted Maris. After all, they'd been best friends for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the way Alexander had looked at her earlier had been unsettling, almost predatory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned a sharp glare on Alexander. "I don't know what your game is, but if you don't leave right now, I'm calling security. Once I press this button, you'll be dragged off in seconds. You won't even have time to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander refused to back down. He pointed at Maris. "It was her! If you don't believe me, just check the wine bottle. The cap will have a tiny puncture mark. That should prove I'm telling the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris shot back instantly, "I didn't do anything! He's lying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Silvia could react, Maris grabbed the bottle off the table, popped the cork, and poured herself half a glass. Without hesitation, she took a long sip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There! Do I look drugged to you?" she sneered, raising a middle finger at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned. He couldn't understand how she wasn't affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That anesthetic should have taken effect in under a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maris smirked, "Silvia, I am fine, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really going to trust some random delivery guy over our years of friendship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's eyes flashed with cold fury. Without another word, she pressed the button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep male voice came through the intercom. "Ms. Hewitt, do you need assistance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia turned back to Alexander, her tone icy. "I don't care who sent you or what your intentions are. If you don't leave now, you'll be dragged out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated, then suddenly asked, "Are you really called Silvia? Not Ava?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the intercom grew tense. "Ms. Hewitt, are you in danger? I'll send someone immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face fell. He instinctively tried to summon the Force, only to find that his body was completely empty of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Did I really just dream all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or have I truly lost my mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I'm leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Conflicted and shaken, Alexander turned and walked away.</span></p></div>
