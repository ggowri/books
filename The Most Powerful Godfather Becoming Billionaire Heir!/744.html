        <h1>Chapter 744 Mission Failed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake was beaten and spun around with screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take my formula, greedy jerk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped Jake again, and he fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my sight now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar of rage, Alexander kicked him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Jake fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Alexander turned and glared at Elaine without any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression scared her as she said with a trembling voice, "I... I am a woman. You want to hit a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two bodyguards around her immediately pulled their guns and pointed them at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put your guns down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson and Melin roared at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Anderson's guards and Melin also aimed their guns at them, ready to shoot at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Eddy and the people from Loscity Hospital gathered around and glared at Elaine and her bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was now the savior of Loscity. Everyone admired him and wouldn't tolerate anyone who dared to be disrespectful to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anderson sneered. "This is Loscity, not Risun. I am the governor. If you dare to hurt Mr. Hawthorne, I'll end up in jail for the rest of your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp gaze made Elaine shudder, and her face became even more ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine only had two bodyguards, but Anderson had more than a dozen guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the uproar, all the cops and soldiers rushed inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, dozens of people pointed their guns at Elaine and her two companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine's pretty face turned deathly pale, and the two bodyguards quickly put down their guns, slinking off to the side in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander revealed a mocking smile and said, "Who else wants to snatch the formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire place fell silent; even including Elaine, the trouble-making experts looked at each other, none daring to make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all people of high status, yet they were publicly humiliated by Alexander, and their hearts were filled with hatred towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Elaine. She loathed Alexander so much that her beautiful face became distorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her secret mission to Loscity had fallen through, yet she could no longer target Alexander, or else she would surely suffer the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry. I should have offended you." Elaine deeply bowed to Alexander in apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp light flashed in Alexander's eyes. This woman was flexible and definitely not as simple as she seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elaine, the leader, has already apologized, those who wanted to snatch the formula have kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anderson and Eddy were seeing Alexander off, the outside was already packed with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately cheered and leaped for joy when they saw Alexander coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hail Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Alexander's antidote, they would only be able to wait for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing the threat of death, everyone's gratitude towards Alexander was beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, the expert group was staring at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine had already taken off her protective suit and mask. With Alexander's antidote, it was only a matter of time before Loscity returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked to be in her late twenties, with fair and delicate skin, appearing extremely attractive. Especially those lustrous eyes of hers, which emitted a bewitchingly enchanting glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm not done with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine was very discontent, with a flash of fierceness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Awakened, Jake stood obediently beside Elaine, his face swollen like a pig's head, </span><span>looking just like a wounded wild boar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed viciously, "Damn Alexander! I didn't expect him to really eradicate the plague. Our plan has failed. Otherwise, according to the plan, by prolonging their lives for a while, we could have gained billions, even tens of billions in enormous wealth. That bastard Alexander has ruined our plan; I'm going to kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake became more and more angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you pig head! If you dare to attack Alexander now, I'm afraid none of us will be able to leave Loscity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine scolded Jake without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake bit his lower lip and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all members of the Sakra Society, who, under the orders of Yinson, joined the expert team with the intention of making a huge profit in Loscity, only to have their plans foiled by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake said worriedly, "If we fail to complete the plan this time, Mr. White definitely won't spare us..."</span></p></div>
