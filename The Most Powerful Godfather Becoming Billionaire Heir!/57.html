        <h1>Chapter 57 Parkinson's Disease</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subordinate beside Oscar smiled and said, "Sir Stewart, Alexander is a loser. But if he is willing to pay a high price for the gemstone, I think we can sell it to him. We can't go against money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, Ava supports him. She's rich. Let's see if she's willing to pay such a huge sum of money for this kept man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar snorted contemptuously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does the Kaylon need the money? That guy cursed me again and again. I won't sell him the gemstone even if he offers a high price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subordinate was about to say something, but Oscar waved his hand impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop talking about this. I know what I'm doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hated Alexander so much that he would never sell the top-quality gemstone to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Oscar was about to pick up the cup, his hands suddenly shook, and then he stiffened all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My hands...my body. Why can't I move?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He widened his eyes in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when he didn't know what was happening, he began to feel waves of stabbing pain in his stiff body as if he were being pricked by needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh dear, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar started shouting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone around him was terrified. At this moment, Oscar collapsed on the sofa and drooled, his whole body was as stiff as wood, and his right hand shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hurry up! Call an ambulance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was thrown into total confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar looked painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He muttered, "Could it be that what Alexander said was true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar was soon sent to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A young man in a doctor's gown asked anxiously, "What happened to my grandpa?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone started shouting at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Stewart, please examine Sir Stewart. We don't know what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With your medical skills, Sir Stewart will be saved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Vincent performed a series of checkups on his grandfather, he turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Parkinson's disease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar trembled and asked, "Vincent, what's wrong with me? Is it really Parkinson's disease? Can I be cured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent hesitated and said, "Grandpa, it's Parkinson's disease. It can only be relieved by taking medicine, but it can't be completely cured. Moreover, as time goes by, the medicine will become less and less effective, and the symptoms will become more and more serious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Oscar grimaced, and his whole body was soaked with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but think of Alexander's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hurry up and drive me to see Alexander. Maybe he can cure me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Oscar looked down on Alexander and was unwilling to believe him, he had to ask Alexander for help now that he was attacked by Parkinson's disease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the command of Oscar, Vincent had to take him to see Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Saint Tower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was meeting her new secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary asked solemnly, "Ms. Blackburn, the latest information we've gathered is that Oscar from the Kaylon has suffered a Parkinson's attack and has been sent to the hospital. Will this delay our alliance with the Kaylon? What shall we do now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava slammed the table and stood up excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Oscar having a Parkinson's attack? It's only been a few days, not even a week... I didn't expect Alexander to be right..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, she asked curiously, "Ms. Blackburn, it's not a good thing that Sir Stewart is seriously ill, is it? Will his replacement sent by the Kaylon affect the alliance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. He will come to me for help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The secretary was confused, not knowing what Ava meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, someone came in to report that Oscar had been carried into the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speak of the devil, and there he is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's beautiful eyes sparkled, and she became even more admiring and interested in Alexander's mysterious abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A large group of people came in carrying a stretcher, followed by a young and handsome man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's eyes lit up when he saw Ava. What a beautiful and elegant woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Ms. Blackburn, I'm Vincent Stewart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava nodded lightly and then asked Oscar, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body stiffening, Oscar said with a painful expression, "Ms. Blackburn, please ask Alexander to come and cure me. I don't want to suffer from Parkinson's disease..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander's daughter is having surgery today, and he is keeping her company in the hospital. I'm afraid he is not available."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face changed. He knew that Ava was tantalizing him, but he was at his wits' end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, please...please help me. I don't want to suffer like this for the rest of my life...Can you go to see Alexander with him and put in a few good words for me?"</p></div>
