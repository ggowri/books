        <h1>Chapter 274 The Ambush</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To wealthy and powerful men, women were nothing more than toys for amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder, after ruthlessly crushing the Fairfax family, playfully patted Jane on the backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, as long as you cooperate, the Fairfax family might not become the main agent, but they can still be my distributor," Schroder said, smirking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's eyes lit up. He quickly pulled Jane along, repeatedly thanking Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many looked at the Fairfax family with envy, knowing that even as a distributor, they would still make a fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments ago, Jane had been terrified. Now, she snapped out of it, quickly snuggling into Schroder's arms, whining flirtatiously, "Don't worry, General. I'll do whatever you want, anything at all..." she cooed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She batted her eyes and traced her fingers teasingly across Schroder's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder chuckled. "I want you to help me deal with your ex-husband. Make Alexander hand over the magic powder formula. Are you willing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was taken aback, a flash of hesitation in her eyes. But she gritted her teeth and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, General. I'll do whatever you ask! That bastard Alexander dumped me after making it big. I'll never forgive him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Jane's mind, even though she had forced Alexander to divorce, she still blamed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Alexander rise to success and not let her share in the wealth and luxury?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering how her repeated attempts to reconcile were rejected, Jane was both embarrassed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew thumped his chest in assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, General. The Fairfax family is sworn enemies with Alexander, and it's our duty to take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the Fairfax family also pledged their loyalty, nearly offering their hearts to Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all are quite perceptive. I like perceptive people," Schroder said, nodding with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then looked towards the main entrance, asking arrogantly, "Where's that kid Alexander? Why isn't he here yet? Is he too scared to come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was extracting meteorite iron, completely losing track of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He enveloped the meteorites with Force energy, which seeped inside, slowly crushing and melting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The iron, glowing faintly, was gradually refined. Before he realized it, Alexander had extracted a piece the size of his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that half of the meteorites were still left, Alexander felt pleased with his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once all the meteorites were refined, there would be enough iron to forge the lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had been delayed at Treasure Island recently, and his skills in carving the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern hadn't improved much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could engrave 108 </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns onto a top-tier yellow gemstone, it would form the Energy Convergence Matrix, the energy core of the lightsaber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Bzz</span><span> </span><span>bzz</span><span> </span><span>bzz</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His phone rang. It was Ava calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snapped out of it, slapping his forehead. He had forgotten about the banquet! He quickly answered the call and exchanged a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon got ready, donning a sharp black suit and polished shoes, looking dashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, also dressed elegantly, took Alexander's arm as they left the villa together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and Marvin were already waiting outside. Once the couple got in, the cars sped off towards the Hansen Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the front passenger seat, Augusta reported, "Boss, Schroder has stationed some special forces snipers outside, ready to ambush us. Charlize and Logan are monitoring them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're gathered along the main road to the Hansen Villa, clearly waiting for Schroder's orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava leaned against Alexander, asking worriedly, "Maybe we shouldn't go. Both Schroder and Orion mean us harm. Aren't we walking right into a trap?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, placing his hand gently on Ava's soft thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Special forces snipers? Interesting. I'll show Schroder what it means never coming back," he grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava had no idea that Alexander had allied with the Fraternity, the Federer family, the Saint Group, Oscar, and Mary from the Blood Gang. He had become the true boss of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Schroder's men entered </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, they were under constant surveillance.</span></p></div>
