        <h1>Chapter 1335 A Fatal Mistake</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed his steel staff and headed out to the courtyard to practice the Dragonhell Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The original combat art had included ten forms, but only five had survived the ages&mdash;Storming the Underworld, Repelling the Army, Warrior's Challenge, Escape from the Forge, and Crashing the Party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but crack a smile. The Dragonhell Staff was definitely something else&mdash;he'd never seen combat techniques with such dramatic names before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still grinning, he took his stance. The Force spiraled around him as he began spinning the iron staff in practiced motions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, one could still make out his silhouette. But within seconds, he became a blur of shadow and motion. The staff whirled with the fury of a storm, creating an impenetrable defense that flowed like a mighty river - constant, unbreakable, and absolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dragonhell Staff's movements were pure art in motion. Its techniques were beyond anything he'd seen before. No wonder they said the staff was the ancestor of all weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four months flew by in a flash. Alexander kept to a strict routine, moving only between his quarters and the training grounds. His daily sparring sessions with Sellers taught him more than he could've imagined&mdash;the Schneier Spear Technique really lived up to its legendary reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought back to that night at Emerald Manor when he'd sworn his oath to send all the demons back to hell. Since then, his heart had been clear, and his training had taken on new meaning. Everything just clicked into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt pretty good about his progress. He'd only been in this strange world for ten months, but he'd already maxed out as a level-two warrior and was on the verge of breaking through to level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Sellers, even the most gifted warriors in Sahasia's recorded history needed five years to advance from level-two to level-three. Alexander couldn't help but grin&mdash;clearly, the universe had blessed him with some seriously good luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But while Alexander was riding high, someone else was fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the courtyard of the Marshal's Mansion in Darwin, Julius was throwing an absolute fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean he's been hanging around the Outer Court this whole time? You useless idiot. Have you been slacking off?" he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny pouted like a kicked puppy. "Mr. Wetherall, I swear I'm innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn furrowed his brow. "Mr. Wetherall, perhaps we could try another approach..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect! Yes, that's brilliant!" Julius's face lit up. "Follow the plan exactly. If you pull this off, you'll be well rewarded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Alexander had barely settled in after his training session when he heard a knock at his door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door knocker echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clyde hurried to answer it. Outside stood a messenger in black, holding up a letter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clyde took the letter and brought it to Alexander, who was in the middle of his meal. He opened it and started reading while he ate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Alexander, I need to meet you tonight at the poplar grove, ten miles west of Emerald Manor by Dominion Church. I have something important to discuss. From Logan.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alex couldn't help but chuckle at the message. Logan was trying to be all formal and mysterious&mdash;that was new. Come to think of it, he hadn't seen Logan in ages. Kind of missed the guy, if he was being honest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd find out what this was about soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, under a moonless sky whipped by fierce winds, four figures dressed in black combat gear lurked in the poplar grove ten miles west of Emerald Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny fidgeted with his steel dagger, practically bouncing with excitement. "Finn, he's coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it," Finn hissed, his eyes glinting dangerously in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, he's not walking away alive," he added under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baylor cracked his massive knuckles. The spiked brass knuckles he wore gleamed menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten how Alex had held back during their fight at the arena&mdash;sure, Baylor had been seriously injured, but he'd recovered. And now, it was payback time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, that's what happens when you mess with Mr. Wetherall," sneered a balding man as he showed off with a few fancy moves of his steel sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Alex strolled into the grove wearing dark athletic wear, looking completely at ease. The place was dead quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where the hell is Logan?" he muttered. "Crap. I walked right into this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's internal alarm was blaring full blast. The dark poplar grove felt like it was hiding some vicious monster, ready to pounce at any moment. He was just about to turn tail and get the hell out of there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leaving so soon? I don't think so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn burst out of the shadows with his three goons, surrounding Alexander in a tight circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mind raced. Julius had been quiet for months, and he'd assumed the guy had backed off. One wrong move, and now everything was falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Julius really went all out this time," he thought. "That old fighter isn't just any random thug&mdash;he's the same level three warrior from before. And he brought three level-two warriors. They're really pulling out all the stops for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenny jumped forward with a mocking laugh. "What's wrong, tough guy? Ready to get on your knees and beg?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a level-two warrior, and I'm level-three," Finn said, his face dark as storm clouds. "Don't fight it. We'll tie you up nice and neat, then you can go apologize to Mr. Wetherall properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finn, that's way too easy on him!" Baylor roared in frustration.</span></p></div>
