        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa burst into laughter. "Let me go? Do you think I'm a fool? If you have the guts, kill me. I'm not telling you a thing about the amulet's origin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow and Kerwin erupted in anger, their faces contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch! Think carefully. If you don't talk, I'll make sure you die in agony," Woodrow threatened, unwilling to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa shot them a look of utter disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the nonsense. Do what you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin sneered, "Enough talking. Give her a tenfold dose of the stimulant! When she's begging for a man, we'll get our answers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow agreed immediately, "Yes, let's do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a handful of red pills, at least a dozen of them, and, with Kerwin's help, grabbed Alyssa to force them into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful shout suddenly thundered through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible wave of sound crashed over them like a raging tide. Woodrow and Kerwin clutched their ears in pain, screaming as their eardrums felt like they were being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soundwave reverberated through the room with such force that the windows shattered into shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alyssa seemed unaffected; the attack was directed solely at the two wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow and Kerwin were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This old castle was a hidden stronghold; how could someone suddenly break in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had traps set up and guards stationed outside&mdash;how had this happened without any warning?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Alexander had only just stepped into the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his All-seeing Eyes, he could see through the walls, witnessing Woodrow trying to force-feed Alyssa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar as fierce as a tiger, he charged forward, caring nothing for the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! Or I'll shoot!" a guard yelled, but before he could finish, Alexander bulldozed through them like a runaway train, sending bodies flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pace never faltered as he stormed ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shot at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Machine gun fire erupted, bullets pouring down like rain as they tore through the corridor, aiming to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all for nothing&mdash;each bullet passed harmlessly through the afterimage Alexander left in his wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he was upon the shooter, delivering a single blow that sent the guard crashing lifelessly to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, half the guards were dead, sprawled across the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were skilled, elite Mafia enforcers, yet before Alexander, they were powerless, like mice before a lion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining guards regrouped, creating a crossfire at the doorway and unleashing another barrage of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire continued nonstop as they took turns firing, expertly swapping out empty magazines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce gunfire locked down the corridor, making it impossible for anyone to advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander remained calm, grabbing two bodies as shields and charging forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullets thudded into the corpses, and any stray shot was deflected by an unseen Force, unable to even brush his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the corridor as guards were flung aside, landing with sickening thuds as they coughed up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These trained fighters were no match for Alexander's unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic tricks," Alexander muttered, pausing at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a cold snort, noticing the trap set just inside. With his All-seeing Eyes, it was a child's game to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one powerful kick, he sent the door&mdash;and the trap&mdash;flying, the heavy wood crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you? Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow and Kerwin had just recovered from the searing pain in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't weak, but Alexander's speed was something they had never anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Your City of Sorcery has been spreading sickness through Loscity, and I haven't even dealt with you for that yet. Now you dare stir up trouble in Mandale Town? You're audacious beyond belief."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Woodrow's face twisted in fear, and Kerwin's turned ghostly pale. Neither of them could have expected Alexander to appear out of nowhere, descending upon them like a vengeful storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the same man who had once made the elder Rock disappear without a trace&mdash;a terrifying legend come to life right before their eyes.</span></p></div>
