        <h1>Chapter 712 We Don't Want Jewelry</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia deliberately drew the sharp blade slowly from its scabbard, which glowed coldly in the firelight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say you wanted me to eat? Believe it or not, I will castrate you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia was only tender to Alexander and always cold to other men.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry! I was wrong. I just talked nonsense. Please forgive me. I really don't want to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man wept bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took tremendous courage to commit suicide, but if he didn't commit suicide, his family would be implicated, and he would be killed anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't want to die and regretted it so much that he wished to pull out his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now he deliberately slandered Alexander just to put on air and demonstrate his unique personality, but the result shocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and commit suicide. I won't kill your family then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was already impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man cried loudly and begged him for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia drew her katana and strode towards the corpulent man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "I'll cripple your limbs first and then throw you into the sea to feed the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't come over. I was wrong. I was really wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man desperately pleaded with Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia remained unmoved. She approached him, raised her katana with both hands, and was about to chop him down in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I'll do it myself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man was finally cornered. He slowly took out a pistol from behind his waist and pointed the muzzle at his temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will commit suicide. Please don't kill my family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing sound of gunfire broke the silence on the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corpulent man's head exploded like a rotten watermelon, and his body fell heavily into the sand, with blood mixed with white brain tissue flowing all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pungent smell of blood was particularly unpleasant in the cool sea breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the corpulent man died, all the leaders who had been invited to the party were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a leader of a force on Treasure Island, he had hundreds of subordinates and a few experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just a few words from Alexander were enough to compel him to commit public suicide.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember this! From now on, if you want to stay and do business on Treasure Island, abide by the laws I've promulgated. Don't say things you shouldn't say, and don't do things you shouldn't do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?" Alexander asked with full energy, his tone revealing a domineering attitude that did not allow for any rebuttal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone didn't dare to resist, feeling that he was the king who ruled them.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will definitely not be stupid and will follow all arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We will definitely obey the laws you've promulgated! If anyone dares to violate them, you don't need to do anything, but we will kill the bastard first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of people bowed their heads to Alexander in unison as a sign of submission.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. As long as you abide by the regulations, your business will grow bigger and bigger in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded with satisfaction and glanced fiercely at everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shuddered at the same time, as if they were burned by a red-hot iron. They didn't dare to meet his gaze and quickly bent down deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After establishing his authority, Alexander turned and left with Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unwilling to waste the remaining time with these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize were excited yet scared. Even though they had sex with Alexander together, it was still too much for them. They felt weak and tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if Alexander wanted to make love, there was no way for them to refuse, and it never occurred to them to refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're both exhausted, right? Go back and have a good rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned and patted their butts, knowing very well what Rosalia and Charlize were thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia instantly shook her head. "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm fine. Do you need me to accompany you? I am okay, and I like to sleep with you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize nodded quickly. They still wanted to be with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe sent over some valuable jewelry, all of which were found in the secret vault of the Red Umbrella Group. Take a look and pick out some that you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia and Charlize gazed at each other and mustered up the courage to say, "Mr. Hawthorne, we don't want jewelry."</span></p></div>
