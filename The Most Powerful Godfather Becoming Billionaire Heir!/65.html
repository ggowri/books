        <h1>Chapter 65 The Invitation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava seemed not to hear Theodore and ignored him completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander put his arm around Ava's slender waist and said, "She is my girlfriend, so don't waste your time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore's face became increasingly cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, no woman I want can escape from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just like your ex-wife Jane. I had several sexes with her last night. I have to say that bitch is really good in bed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Alexander had no feelings for Jane now, he was so angry that he gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Theodore burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I advise you to find a place to kill yourself. That will save you a lot of pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava interrupted Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Theodore, bring it out on me. Why do you pick on my boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore looked at her with a strange expression. It seemed that Ava didn't know Alexander's true identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such women were really rare, much better than women like Jane who curried favor with the powerful and pursued pleasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That made Theodore want to conquer Ava even more, so he forced a smile again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I will hold an alliance dinner and use our new product Euphoria as a medium to form an alliance with the four major families, eight major groups, and sixteen organizations in Loscity to work together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'd like to invite you to witness the power of the Brilliant Group, and you will definitely change your mind after that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Theodore took a gilded invitation from his subordinate and put it in Ava's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he turned to leave, he pointed his hand like a gun at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bang! You're dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cackling, Theodore got into the car arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cars sped away amid the roars of engines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A murderous intent flashed across Alexander's eyes. Theodore really came to Loscity. Alexander was trying to track down Guzman but in vain. He believed he could get some clues from Theodore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander discovered that there was a man who did not follow Theodore and instead took advantage of the chaos to hide in the shadows. He must be a killer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, Alexander did not chase after Theodore. He had to ensure Ava's safety first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava picked up the invitation, tore it into two halves, and threw them on the ground, saying angrily, "Damn him. A dinner? It must be another recommendation for harmful drugs. I wish I could burn down the Brilliant Group."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander picked up the invitation and said with a smile, "I'll go there and see what Theodore is up to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava said sullenly, "What are you going to do? It's very dangerous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shrugged, looking indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go. This damn guy chose the wrong time to come..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava recalled the pleasure she felt when Alexander touched her. Although she looked forward to it, she was not in the mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled and hugged Ava, putting his hands on her plump buttocks and caressing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bouncy and plump buttocks were good to the touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the killer lurking in the shadows took action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He abruptly leaped up and dashed to Alexander from behind, his short saber flashing a terrifying black light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a fast attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer waited patiently and launched the attack until Alexander turned around. He was skillful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silent saber was about to pierce through Alexander's back, and the killer couldn't help but smile. If nothing unexpected happened, Alexander would die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if the saber left a small cut on his skin, the dart frog venom on the blade would definitely kill him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer smiled at the prospect of getting the reward of tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava had no idea there was a killer. If the saber pierced Alexander's body, it would definitely pierce through Ava as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was prepared and swiftly carried Ava away like a bolt of lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava didn't know what was happening and subconsciously hugged Alexander tightly, pressing her soft and plump body against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer was taken aback, not expecting his fatal blow would miss Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He soon reacted and launched another attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sharp blade instantly went up to Alexander's side, and Ava let out a scream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She saw the killer and the ferocious saber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The killer smiled again. He was a veteran killer of the Brilliant Group and couldn't remember how many people he had killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was lucky to survive the first attack, but he wouldn't dodge the second one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the killer's smile abruptly froze on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander seemed to have expected his second attack.</p></div>
