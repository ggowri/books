        <h1>Chapter 600 Encirclement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the camp was small, it provided food and drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delicious aroma filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large tent was set up on the open space, with dozens of banquet tables laid out to entertain guests who were not of high status enough to enter the Morris house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests drank and enjoyed the food while talking about this grand wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Augusta looked at each other and found two seats to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delicious dishes were served one by one. Augusta ate with great relish while scanning the surroundings with sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked around. Everything was under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta didn't notice anything wrong, but Alexander felt something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the other man restrained his murderous intent and made no sound, Alexander was certain that it was directed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced over there calmly, where two tables of people were eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were from the Morris family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were whispering and tried to lower their voice, but Alexander heard them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like Alexander. Confirm it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was not mistaken. He is the one in the photo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them took out his cell phone and looked at it, then stared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect he would actually dare to come. He never expected that our head had already sent us the photos."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catch him. Mr. Frederick Morris will reward us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people became more and more excited as they talked, and their eyes towards Alexander became colder and colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. Alexander is not ordinary. Call the Tiger Strike Squad outside in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The People at two tables pretended nothing had happened and were fiddling with their cell phones, calling for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, eight people rushed in. One of them carried a strangely shaped backpack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Tiger Strike Squad is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people got excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more than twenty people of the Morris family all stood up and glared at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They planned to catch Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Alexander's table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another group of people were guarding the periphery, staring at Alexander to prevent him from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere became increasingly solemn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta also felt something was wrong, and his face changed drastically. But Alexander signaled him to stay cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Morris family, plus the Tiger Strike Squad, had surrounded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the situation was unfavorable, Alexander did not panic at all. Instead, he poured a glass of wine and tasted it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta asked coldly, "Boss, shall we fight our way out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was usually calm, but now he was nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Morris family was powerful. Augusta was nervous but was ready to fight to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still had a smile. He decided to be flexible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, these people were nothing. Alexander had no fear in front of anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people also felt something was wrong and ran outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Augusta were the only ones left in the tent, facing dozens of members of the Morris family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I didn't expect you to be so bold as to come here. You are dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got an easy job!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family laughed triumphantly, feeling that they had secured victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were carrying miniature submachine guns in those backpacks, and the magazines had been modified to double the amount of ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each bullet tip had been filed with a file and were all shrapnels. When they hit a person, they would leave a hole, which would either kill the person or cause disability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta, who had been ready, stood up and swung his knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was now a level-two metahuman and possessed the dual abilities of enhanced speed and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade was as fast as lightning. These people could not dodge it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of one of the Morris family members at the front flew straight out, blood gushing.</span></p></div>
