        <h1>Chapter 799 Annihilation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We... we have... over 30 people in Loscity..." The young man stammered, avoiding Alexander's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's your name? Why are you in Loscity instead of staying in Risun? Tell me everything you know. Maybe I'll let you die a quick death," Alexander said, pressing his foot onto the man's shoulder and looking down at him with a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "If you lie, I have ways to make you wish for death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man's psychological defenses were already shattered. Under Alexander's threats, he could barely hold it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll tell you everything. My name is Harvey Norgate. I'm Zora's personal assistant," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Personal assistant? And what does that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harvey, trembling, responded, "It means I help her with everything and spend nights with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sizing up Harvey, Alexander thought the guy wasn't bad-looking. No wonder he'd been chosen as Zora's assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where is Zora?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll tell you everything. She's rented a villa nearby, and she's guarded by eight bodyguards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harvey answered every question, and Alexander quickly had all the information he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said casually, "Alright. Since you've been honest, I'll give you a quick end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. Please don't kill me!" Harvey's face went pale as he struggled to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I despise garbage like you who sell out women," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His foot came down, and a surge of Force shattered Harvey's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harvey collapsed silently to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, should we go get Zora right now?" Marvin asked, rolling up his sleeves in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logan also looked eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "These bastards dared to ambush us. We have to take them all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was eager to take revenge on Zora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Marvin, Logan, you two come with me. The rest should clean up this place. As for these prisoners..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cold gaze swept over the remaining captives, who immediately pleaded for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alexander waved his hand. "The Treasure Island needs laborers. Send them to work there for the rest of their lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The captives sighed in relief, spared from death but condemned to a lifetime of hard labor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all devastated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned away, taking Marvin and Logan to leave the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Marvin parked the car and looked back at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He announced, "Boss, this should be the place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glanced out of the window, spotting a villa in the distance, and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Marvin parked the car, Alexander instructed them to guard the front and back entrances, ensuring no one could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander scanned the villa with his special vision. Sensing no immediate danger, he climbed over the fence and approached the front door with steady, measured steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone measured his strides, he would find each of them perfectly even, down to the millimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His vision power illuminated the villa's interior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It spanned around 200 square meters, simply but elegantly furnished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, he pressed the doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hurried footsteps approached from inside. Zora knew he had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, what a surprise! I didn't expect you to find this place. Welcome!" She opened the door and greeted him warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was dressed in a silk nightgown that left little to the imagination, her ample curves swaying with each step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But despite her warm exterior, Alexander noticed the fear and anxiety in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry for the late visit, but 20 or so thugs tried causing trouble tonight, so I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd come to ask what's going on, Ms. Jared," Alexander replied with a courteous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora's face, however, remained tense, her smile forced and uneasy.</span></p></div>
