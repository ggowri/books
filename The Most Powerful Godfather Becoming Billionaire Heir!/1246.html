        <h1>Chapter 1246 They're Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're coming!" Alexander shouted, turning sharply to the horizon, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's coming?" Norah asked, still trying to grasp the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The beast horde is on the move&mdash;there are a lot of them..." Alexander's tone was deadly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Norah didn't perceive the urgency. As a level-two metahuman, her senses were nowhere near as sharp as Alexander's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the tranquility shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rapid barrage of gunfire erupted from atop the city walls, filling the air with gunshots that shattered the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah snapped to attention as the reality crashed down on her&mdash;the beast horde was really here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before her eyes, a terrifying wave of dark shadows electrified the rain-soaked ground, a relentless tide that seemed to darken the very sky above </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards on the wall were firing relentlessly, their desperation evident in every shot they took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flashes of fire erupted from the muzzles of their weapons, resembling whips of death as they lashed toward the advancing horde of mutated beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hail of bullets tore through the air, knocking down one grotesque creature after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the beasts were tough, they fell like dominos under the relentless storm of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the sheer numbers were overwhelming. It was like an endless ocean of beasts; whenever one fell, the next charged in to take its place, undeterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of mortars roared to life, their shells soaring skyward before arching down into the midst of the horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Explosions erupted like angry flowers, sending chunks of flesh and gore flying in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As bits and pieces rained down, the ground played host to a grotesque band of carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy machine guns Alexander brought with him unleashed their fury, joined by a flurry of automatic rifles that blazed like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bullets fell like raindrops, creating a fierce web of firepower that swept across the beast swarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though iron hammers were descending in relentless succession, punishing anything that dared to surge forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these monsters were unfazed&mdash;bloodthirsty and driven, they charged toward </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port without a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numerous beasts fell, yet a new wave pressed on, determined to breach the makeshift walls that stood between them and their prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mortar shells continued their deadly ballet, soaring overhead before plummeting into the heart of the horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These munitions had been retrofitted with incendiary explosives, and suddenly, the </span><span>battlefield ignited in a blaze of flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fires roared to life, igniting many of the beasts and sending up acrid columns of smoke that filled the air with a noxious stench, permeating the entire warzone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain had ceased, but the slaughter was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the horde appeared unending, the inferno and countless bullets were taking their toll, claiming the lives of numerous abominable creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, many of the beasts caught fire, thrashing wildly as they collided with their panicked companions, inadvertently forcing them into the same pyre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fiery confusion released an unbearable stench, disrupting the beasts' senses, which were already strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the mutated monkeys lurking in the horde, some commanded by their mutated king, disorder reigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While some continued to charge forward, others began to retreat, overwhelmed by the carnage unfolding around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the incendiary and white phosphorus </span><span>munitions</span><span> exploded amidst the throng of beasts, the transformed creatures erupted into a frenzy of pain. They screeched like mad cattle, their agony-riddled minds twisting in sheer panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their madness, they turned on each other, attacking their kin with reckless abandon. Existence devolved into chaos as countless mutated beasts fell victim to their own kind, some shredded to pieces in the turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The inferno spread rapidly, its flames licking across the battlefield, threatening to envelop a thousand-yard stretch of the port. This fiery barrier became a death zone, effectively halting the horde's relentless charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the overwhelming numbers&mdash;the beast wave exceeding a staggering one hundred thousand&mdash;their unity faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this mayhem unfold, Alexander breathed a sigh of relief. The incendiary rounds and white phosphorus munitions were proving to be the most effective tools against the oncoming tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, beasts were still beasts. Even mutated ones had fears; they still clung to the instinct of self-preservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness they're not like zombies commanded by the living dead. Those things are a nightmare since they don't know fear and throw themselves in danger without a second thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the beast wave wasn't entirely quelled, at least the first onslaught had been temporarily staved off, and remarkably so. The dead and dying already numbered in the thousands, many reduced to nothing but ash in the conflagration.</span></p></div>
