        <h1>Chapter 515 Spoils of War</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no use. You'll never be able to escape from my grasp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's tone was full of sarcasm and there was a smug smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle had no chance to escape and was falling step by step into the abyss of desire. No one could save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had already taken off all the clothes on Danielle, and her plump body was immediately completely exposed, which was attractive enough to commit a crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were red and blue marks on her perfect body, which were left by Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Felix saw these traces, he became even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here and behave yourself, or I'll kill your family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle felt cold in her heart when she was threatened by Felix, as if she had fallen into an ice cave in the polar region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't go on like this. What should I do? What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was desperate and shook her head desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix took the dog's tail and slid it across Danielle's butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was suddenly horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be nervous. You'll know in a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix laughed unscrupulously, with a strange light flashing in his eyes. His hypnotic ability was like a needle, piercing deep into Danielle's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he fed Danielle another new medicine. Under the double influence, Danielle was completely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her body burning hot and could only twist subconsciously in her dying struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it very uncomfortable? </span><span>Hehehe</span><span>. Beg me, and I will satisfy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's tone became extremely seductive, like an intoxicating lullaby, echoing in Danielle's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Danielle was quite skilled, she had no special powers. She could not resist </span><span>the hypnotic power of a level-three metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, there are new drugs that stimulate her desire, and combined with hypnosis, they make her completely sink into the abyss of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, relax. Take your time... don't struggle... don't resist anymore... trust that I will treat you well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I am your husband. I can help you and make you happy every day from now on. Don't you want to be happy forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you are obedient, you can get all of this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix continued to hypnotize, determined to completely destroy Danielle's last will today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you...you are my husband...I will listen to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Danielle's will collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix showed a satisfied smile and gently stroked Danielle's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good, remember from now on, I am your husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle nodded vigorously without any shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubby, please be nice to me, I want to be happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, on the other hand, was no longer in a hurry. It was like he was playing a game of cat and mouse, deliberately teasing Danielle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hubby, I want to be happy, please. I can't bear it anymore. Don't torture me anymore. I will listen to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you have to remember that all of this is your own will. You are willing to submit to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix continued to guide and planted an anchor in Danielle's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle nodded without hesitation. Her beautiful eyes filled with desire, and the last bit of rationality disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix picked up the dog's tail and slid it over Danielle's body, wandering around and gradually sinking into the deep, charming hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle let out a charming moan and no longer resisted at all. Instead, she looked very much enjoying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes had lost their former liveliness and were now filled with burning desire. She was completely trapped in the abyss and unable to extricate herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took the initiative to kneel on the ground. She raised her round buttocks, swayed coquettishly, turned her head, and looked straight at Felix. Her eyes were so watery that they were almost stringy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix slapped her hard and began to enjoy his spoils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, I'll take you to the Morris Villa later. Thinking of a woman like you is also a good gift!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eerie and evil smile echoed in the basement...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few hours later, a special plane landed at the foot of the snow-capped mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a huge estate here and a small airport next to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for Felix, it was the first time that he saw such a large manor.</span></p></div>
