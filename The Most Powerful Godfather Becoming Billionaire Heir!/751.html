        <h1>Chapter 751 Fight With a Beauty</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty specially constructed an underground shooting range, which also serves as a secret armory. The weapons and ammunition stored inside are sufficient to arm thousands of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the training base, members of the Ultimate Squad, dressed in combat uniforms, were training hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were learning combat, some were punching sandbags, and others were practicing shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander walked in, the first person he saw was Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was also one of the coaches for the special forces team, with her hair tied up in a ponytail, teaching a group of people combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's moves were extremely fierce and full of lethal intent; she was absolutely a hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as everyone saw Alexander, they quickly greeted him in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize quickly gathered everyone to line up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander, their eyes filled with anticipation and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Alexander was a skilled fighter; since he was here, he would surely give them some instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize looked at Alexander with a smile, her gaze filled with intense warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander surveyed the area, nodding in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone has been doing well. Keep up the good work and stay persistent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, someone laughed and said, "Sir, why don't you spar with Ms. Collins and give us some on-the-spot guidance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, upon hearing this, felt a surge of joy in her heart, but she rebuked, "Who gave you permission to speak! Aren't you afraid of being confined?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "Forget it. For my sake this time, there will be no confinement. Since everyone wants to see it, I'll spar with Ms. Collins."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize showed a sly smile and said, "Please give me some pointers on my wrestling skills. How can I defeat my opponent after being taken down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and asked, "Do you want to learn ground fighting techniques? Indeed, ground fighting skills are very important. If mastered well, they can turn a losing situation into a victory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't think much about it, as improving wrestling and ground techniques was indeed necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, while happy, turned serious and said, "Everyone, pay close attention. It's a rare opportunity to receive personal guidance from Mr. Hawthorne. Not only should you watch carefully, but also think deeply and practice more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Charlize spoke, she thought about the physical closeness that would occur between them, causing her cheeks to flush. She then gave Alexander a charming glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was recalling the contents of Ultimate Legacy. The ancestor who left behind this legacy had once defeated a powerful being from another planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That powerful being was most skilled in wrestling and ground combat, and at that time, the ancestor nearly lost to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the Ultimate Legacy included that alien's wrestling and ground fighting techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had never learned these techniques before, but with his current abilities, not only could he remember everything at a glance, but he could also master them instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, watch closely. Mr. Hawthorne and I will demonstrate some ground fighting techniques. It is a rare opportunity, so pay attention," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Charlize's instructions, hundreds of special forces members widened their eyes, staring at Charlize and Alexander with looks full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them, although they had not personally seen Alexander in action, had heard a lot about his amazing feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And knowing Charlize's formidable strength, they were all the more eager for this training session.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and gestured to Charlize. "Let's not waste any time. Come on"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's beautiful, watery eyes sparkled. She smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, she actually dreamed of having sex with Alexander. What an embarrassing dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not expecting Alexander to be here today, Charlize couldn't hold back. She wanted to hug Alexander and have physical contact in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hadn't expected that Charlize's so-called guidance was merely an excuse to hug him in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!" Alexander made a starting move very casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's smile faded, and her expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she just wanted to hug him, she still didn't want to lose too much face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hands touched briefly before quickly pulling away, both looking for an opportunity and testing each other to see who could take the other down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize suddenly exerted force with her feet, grabbed Alexander's arm, and used her hip to lift him up, intending to perform a shoulder throw on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could clearly see that Charlize had taken control of the situation and was about to throw Alexander completely.</span></p></div>
