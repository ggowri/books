        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She saw everything just now? You... why didn't you tell me sooner that she was here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, "So what if she saw? She's not some guy, and she's not </span><span>gonna</span><span> spill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia quickly jumped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. Blackburn. I'm Mr. Hawthorne's most loyal servant, I wouldn't dream of saying anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two... you're completely out of your minds..." Ava muttered, her face flushed as she hurried back to the bedroom, caught between embarrassment and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked at Alexander, her face showing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, do you think Ms. Blackburn's mad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nah, she'll be fine. I planned it this way. She's </span><span>gotta</span><span> break through her inhibitions, or she'll never get involved in our fun. And hey, let's be real, the more beautiful women, the more exciting it gets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's face flushed as she snuggled into Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you really do know how to push the boundaries!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"C'mon, let's hit the shower. Gotta </span><span>get</span><span> cleaned up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander headed towards the bathroom, Rosalia following close behind, her hips swaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, Alexander turned on the shower, letting the hot water run down over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia grabbed the body wash and began scrubbing his back, carefully washing every inch, even down to his toes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander relaxed, enjoying Rosalia's attention, his eyes roving over her toned, shapely figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia wasn't just pretty; her years of training showed in her fit and flawless body, soft in all the right places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what did you think about watching me and Ava earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blunt question sent a shiver through Rosalia, her face flushing instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I... I didn't mean to peek... it's just, I couldn't help it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her chin with one hand, while his other began undoing the buttons of her soaked lace blouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, you know, you </span><span>Azuran</span><span> girls really are something else. You're the wildest one by far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was teasing, laced with a hint of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Mr. Hawthorne, I'm not like this with anyone else... only you," Rosalia stammered, her voice full of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander unhooked her blouse and the bra beneath, letting them drop away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full chest bounced slightly, water glistening on her skin, utterly captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like what you see, Boss? I've been using the beauty cream you made every day&mdash;it works wonders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that stuff's going for tens of thousands on the black market now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia cupped her breasts, working the body wash into a lather, her hands moving over Alexander as she pressed against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tens of thousands a jar on the black market?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled in amusement&mdash;making money off women was always the easiest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God, I must've saved the whole galaxy in a past life to end up here with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia slid against Alexander, her body slick and soft, a sigh escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her against him, Alexander's desire flared, and he spun her around, pinning her beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where'd you learn this massage trick, Rebecca?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's voice was breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I learned it from a friend... she's a prostitute. This is how she keeps her clients hooked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but curse&mdash;Rebecca really was something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On your knees."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he gave the order, Rosalia obeyed, dropping down, her hips raised high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander loved this primal, submissive pose&mdash;it stirred something deep inside him, fulfilling that instinct to dominate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pale hips trembled slightly, water running down her skin, shining under the bathroom light&mdash;utterly irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but be impressed by her sensitivity, truly a rare beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia's voice was a plea, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please... just do it already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped her round cheeks, leaving them flushed, and Rosalia nearly cried out in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast pounced on its prey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia almost blacked out from the rush of sensation, her eyes rolling back in ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the corner of his eye, Alexander noticed the bathroom door&mdash;he'd left it slightly open on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a familiar silhouette hovered just beyond, watching through the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled knowingly; the voyeur was Ava. He knew her curiosity would get the better of her, that she'd come to see for herself.</span></p></div>
