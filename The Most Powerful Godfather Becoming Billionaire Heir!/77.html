        <h1>Chapter 77 Foot Massage</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, Alexander had already mapped out a plan to position the Saint Group as the leading distributor of magic powder, aiming to launch it nationwide and even globally. Meanwhile, Billy would be left to manage operations in Loscity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks for your hard work. I've got a mountain of documents to sign, so you can get back to your tasks," Ava said apologetically as she settled into her chair at the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A thick stack of papers lay before her, and she quickly immersed herself in her work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander chuckled softly, admiring her drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he casually glanced over, he noticed Ava had kicked off her high heels, likely due to the discomfort from the towering stilettos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her delicate feet, clad in black stockings, looked incredibly alluring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander stepped out of the office, he spotted Rebecca waiting by the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was attractive, with a figure that turned heads. Her curves were accentuated, and the deep neckline of her top was undeniably tempting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Alexander's keen eye quickly caught on to the fact that her bust appeared enhanced, likely due to a padded bra that seemed a bit uneven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca snapped, covering her chest, "Hey! What are you staring at?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew you were trouble. If you keep ogling me, I'll tell Ava!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained unfazed. "Ms. Hansen, I think you might have fastened your bra wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca jumped, instinctively looking down to check.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, the clasp was misaligned, making her boobs look a bit lopsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was clear that Alexander had been scrutinizing her closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she shouted, "You're so shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While she glanced around to ensure no one was watching, she quickly reached behind her back to re-fasten her bra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This gave Alexander quite the view. Although Rebecca's assets didn't quite match Ava's or Betty's, they were still a perfect C-cup, and the way she adjusted herself was undeniably captivating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pervert! Aren't you afraid your eyes will pop out?" Rebecca glared at him, her indignation palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell you this. If I hear any rumors about me, you'll regret it!" Rebecca warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's there to see? My girlfriend's are bigger," Alexander quipped, nearly sending Rebecca into a fit of rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Women often took pride in their looks, and even among friends, competition was fierce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's comment had stirred the hornet's nest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Open your eyes and see clearly! I'm not small! This is a classic C-cup, the size every man loves!" Rebecca retorted, puffing out her chest defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smirked. "Still, my girlfriend's got you beat. She's way more alluring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was fuming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're unbelievable! I'm telling Ava!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the elevator doors slid open, and Rebecca rushed inside, hastily pressing the close button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in a split second, Alexander squeezed in just before the doors shut, causing Rebecca to retreat to the corner, wary of this audacious rogue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, as the elevator descended to the ground floor, Alexander didn't even glance her way, leaving Rebecca feeling utterly deflated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, Alexander returned to the office with a pair of cute slippers in hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava looked up, a playful smile on her face. "You're still here? Can't bear to leave me, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked over to her, gently lifting her foot to slide it into one of the slippers. "Give these a try. I'm not sure if they'll fit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava paused, looking at the slippers, warmth flooding her heart at the sweet gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought to herself, "This guy really knows how to win a woman's heart. This gift is both warm and romantic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, I didn't expect you to be so considerate," Ava said, a soft blush spreading across her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why so formal? You're my girlfriend. Taking care of you is just part of the deal. Let me give you a foot rub, relax a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he began to gently massage her small feet, Ava hesitated, feeling a touch embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the soothing sensation made her reluctance fade away. She closed her eyes, letting herself enjoy the comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's movements were meticulous, though he could barely contain his excitement, his hands trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her elegant legs, encased in black stockings, were the perfect balance&mdash;neither too thin nor too full, simply mesmerizing.</p></div>
