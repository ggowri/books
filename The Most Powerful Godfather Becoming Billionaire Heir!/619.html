        <h1>Chapter 619 The Risk Is Too Great</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton exploded with fury. "I'm furious! I have to buy it&mdash;twenty-one million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'll back down? Twenty-three million dollars!" Alexander replied, still looking calm and composed, raising the bid by two million without a care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton was completely incensed by Alexander and had lost all reason, blindly following suit with another two million increases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard, twenty-five million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to beat Alexander and claim this prized ore block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, if you want this ore, you'll have to go through me&mdash;twenty-seven million dollars!" Alexander taunted with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were stunned. They thought, "Have these two lost their minds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the ore certainly seemed promising, with the potential for top-grade gems, gambling millions required certainty, which hardly existed here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The risk was immense if the ore turned out to be just a rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton's eyes were bloodshot with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to challenge me!? Thirty million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton shouted a staggering bid like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. "Thirty million dollars? Alright then, if you're willing to spend millions on a worthless stone, you can have it. I'm out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia suddenly realized Alexander's ploy. He had deliberately provoked Morton into spending an extra million dollars on the stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Alexander, I didn't know you had such a devious side," Olivia said, covering her mouth as she laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy immediately confronted Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Just because you can't compete with Mr. Whitlock, you start spouting nonsense? Weren't you trying to snatch this stone just moments ago? Now that you can't get it, you're trying to sabotage it, huh? Too bad, the stone's here, and your words are useless. You can't have it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton, initially pale, was relieved by Sandy's comments, slowly snapping out of his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But anxiety gnawed at him&mdash;if the stone was void of top-grade gems, he'd face a huge loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd fallen for a goading tactic, he might lose everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million dollars, sold!" the host announced with a trembling voice, not expecting the stone to fetch such a high price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a grateful glance at Alexander, unknowingly giving the impression he'd been planted to rile Morton into bidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations to Mr. Whitlock on acquiring this exceptional ore block!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burst of applause erupted as the audience cheered and clapped enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock is sure to make a huge profit&mdash;let's get the stone cutting started and see those top-grade gems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, with a bid of thirty million dollars, Mr. Whitlock must have known there are top-grade gems in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it obvious? Mr. Whitlock is the head of the auction now; even though the money goes to the Mafia, he must have insider info!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd surrounded Morton with flattery, congratulating him on obtaining top-grade gems, and Morton's confidence swelled once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy cast a disdainful glance at Alexander and Olivia and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are like frogs in a well, haven't seen anything worthwhile and think others haven't either. Olivia, are you blind to be with such a useless man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton let out a hearty laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well said! Offer me a sincere public apology now, and maybe when I extract those top-grade gems, I'll throw you some scraps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy added, "Darling, let's extract the top-grade gems right now! We can sell them at the trade fair and make a killing that'll leave them green with envy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander responded to their arrogance not with words but with a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw Alexander's earlier bravado dwindle, Morton's confidence soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a decisive wave of his hand, he declared, "Cut open that stone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton was utterly convinced that top-grade gems lay within, dreaming of both a substantial profit and the redemption of his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's help Mr. Whitlock cut it open!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Morton's command, the staff promptly summoned the team with specialized tools to begin slicing through the stone.</span></p></div>
