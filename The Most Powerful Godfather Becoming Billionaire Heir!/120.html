        <h1>Chapter 120 The Truth Unveiled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gasped, startled, barely having time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed the attacker's wrist in a flash and twisted it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp crack, the bones snapped, and the man's hand hung limp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a scream as Alexander kicked him across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, staring at Alexander in shock, shaken by his ruthlessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Get him! A million dollars for anyone who captures Alexander!" Sebastian shouted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enticed by the bounty, the men in black charged at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander showed no fear. Moving with deadly precision, he left them reeling, taking them down one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, a dozen men lay sprawled around him, writhing on the floor, clutching their heads, their arms, or their stomachs in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, a cold smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you've been bragging about having the exclusive rights to magic powder. </span><span>Then</span><span> tell me, where's that </span><span>humbug</span><span> Jackson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew shouted, trying to regain control, "Alexander, stop lying. Mr. Gellar will be here any moment now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane took out her phone, smiling smugly. "I'll call Mr. Gellar right now. He must already be on his way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite repeated calls, there was no answer. Jane's face paled, a flicker of panic crossing her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. "Jackson isn't the creator of magic powder at all. He's nothing but a fraud, and you've all been scammed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew stomped in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! </span><span>No way</span><span>! Jane, keep calling! There must be a signal issue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had mortgaged nearly everything the Fairfax family owned to </span><span>give</span><span> Jackson forty million dollars</span><span> as the deposit</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent, watching Jane dial again and again, each failed call twisting the tension tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression grew darker, his gaze fixed on Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why...why isn't he answering..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane tried several more times, growing more flustered with each attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you do, you bastard?" she shouted at Alexander. "What have you done with Mr. Gellar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew pointed accusingly, "Did you kidnap Mr. Gellar? Is that why we can't reach him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander </span><span>laughed</span><span>. He was amused. "You've all been conned. Jackson is a </span><span>fraud</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and Jane shook their heads, voices rising in disbelief, insisting Alexander was just causing trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a shadow of doubt crossed Sebastian's face as an ominous realization set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Betty appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She strolled in, dressed in a white off-the-shoulder gown that hugged her curves, exuding confidence with every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you Jackson is the creator of magic powder?" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain. "The real master has been here all along. But after offending him, don't expect to get your hands on even a pinch of magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sparked murmurs throughout the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, what nonsense are you talking about?" Andrew shouted</span><span>. His </span><span>face flushed with rage. "Everyone knows magic powder was created by Mr. Gellar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane joined in, seething with indignation. "Betty, you're nothing but a sales rep for Mr. Gellar. Who gave you the right to smear him with such lies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of everyone present, Betty smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are all </span><span>idiots</span><span>. Jackson is a fraud. Billy and I never </span><span>got</span><span> magic powder from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> gave a</span><span> contemptuous</span><span> before the expecting audience</span><span>. "The real creator is right in front of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But none of you </span><span>knew it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was thrown into shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Billy and Betty were the only two with access to the magic powder, their words held weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! You're lying! You must be trying to scam us. You and Alexander must be in on this together..." Andrew murmured, dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, fuming, </span><span>cursed</span><span>, "Betty, you're full of crap! There is no 'real creator' here. You and Alexander must have kidnapped Mr. Gellar! You two scheming scumbags are trying to steal his magic powder formula!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you're talking to?" Betty snapped and slapped Jane, knocking her off balance.</span></p></div>
