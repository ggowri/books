        <h1>Chapter 669 Demon Puppet</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was the wizard hiding? There was nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander still stared at the shadow. With his All-seeing Eyes and powerful perception, he had already discovered the wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not the first time he had come into contact with wizards from the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the wizard's aura was the strongest among all the wizards Alexander had ever met, even stronger than that of Guzman. He must be a big shot in the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's judgment was correct. Beverly's trump card was Dereck, a senior elder there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck was almost ninety years old. He grew up in the City of Sorcery and was the most famous dark wizard besides Rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept approaching the shadow aggressively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that he couldn't escape, Dereck suddenly emerged from the shadow and </span><span>waved his hand to send out several puffs of black smoke, which looked like several ferocious black poisonous snakes and enveloped Alexander in a frenzy.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. Witchcraft was a horrible taboo in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander snorted disdainfully, his All-seeing Eyes catching everything very clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those puffs of black poisonous smoke were just a disguise on the surface. Dereck's real killer was the mysterious witchcraft insects hidden inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was unknown how terrifying the witchcraft insects were, they were definitely fatal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swung the Lightsabers quickly, and an impenetrable circular light curtain suddenly formed in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black smoke hit the light curtain, just like boiling water poured onto a raging fire, causing bursts of green smoke, which then evaporated and disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless witchcraft insects hidden in the black smoke were also destroyed by the Lightsabers and turned into ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you kill my little babies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck suddenly appeared and glared at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a skinny man with a few thin white hairs on his head, dressed in a tattered black linen robe.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His exposed parts seemed to be mere bones, with wrinkled skin clinging to them, and there was not a vestige of flesh. His whole body was shriveled.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his body was covered with all sorts of strange, colorful tattoos, even a white skull tattooed on his neck.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander eliminated all the witchcraft insects, a stream of blood flowed from the corner of Dereck's mouth, and he was obviously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all your strength?" Alexander sneered, walking towards him step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dereck, glaring resentfully at Alexander, took from his bosom a tattered weird puppet, waved it at Alexander, and then muttered some incantation.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a closer look, Alexander finally realized what that weird puppet was and immediately flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out to be a shriveled fetus the size of a palm that had been refined into a mummy-like appearance. It was completely black and exuded an extremely grotesque aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a vicious witchcraft, using a fetus to make a demon puppet capable of killing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demon puppet was taken from a fetus that had not been born at full term, soaked in special materials such as oil boiled from corpses, and then refined using witchcraft.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it wasn't a full-term baby and was killed along with their mothers, the demon puppet was quite resentful, evil, and ferocious and would take people's lives without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more people it murdered, the greater its power grew. One day, it would turn against Dereck and kill him, the man who refined it, thus becoming a true demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People of all faiths, including Christians and Catholic priests, were very afraid of something so evil.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were still a few wizards who were willing to take the risk of being killed by the demon puppets in the end because they were incredibly powerful. As a result of the demon puppet, Dereck became a senior elder in the City of Sorcery, only second to Rock in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Dereck felt the threat from Alexander and used his trump card, the demon </span><span>puppet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed a sinister and strange energy rushing towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt a chill along his back, as if something were riding on his back, and at the same time, a pair of cold, black hands closed around his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't breathe, and an acute lack of oxygen made him dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything was doubled. He couldn't see clearly at all, and his body was growing heavier and heavier.</span></p></div>
