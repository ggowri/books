        <h1>Chapter 892 Kill One by One</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet, imbued with supernatural power, saw its might be magnified several-fold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invisible Force on Alexander's body suddenly surged, and the speed of the bullet dropped sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander dodged the bullet and shot Locke at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force made the bullet as fast as lightning, instantly hitting Locke's right shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful impact sent Locke flying several feet away, and he fell to the ground, with blood gushing out of his injured shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Marvin and Shadow supported each other and hid in the woods to avoid becoming a burden to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman suddenly screamed, her whole body trembled, and blood flowed from her nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to conquer Alexander but suffered a backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't restrain him at all. He just glanced at me just now... And I felt like I was struck by lightning..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke covered the wound on his shoulder and muttered, "Where did he go? Be careful of his sneak attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had thrown away his sniper rifle and restrained his breath so that no one could discover his location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow sat on the ground, gasping for breath, with their backs against a tree, both covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I'm sorry. We got you into trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly appeared, and Marvin and Shadow struggled to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move. Take a rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander put his hands on the shoulders of the two and began to use the Force to heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Shadow and Marvin felt much better and had regained most of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guard the surroundings well and don't let Locke and that woman get away. Leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then disappeared into the darkness again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke was knocked into a tree by a powerful force before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pursued Locke, colliding with him like a speeding truck, and sent him tumbling deep into the woods again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With loud crackling sounds, big trees kept falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke, bloodied and enraged, ordered a mass of cobras to intertwine into a colossal snake chain after Alexander's beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's renewed assault prompted the massive snake chain to strike at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was dark in the woods, Alexander could see through things and could see everything clearly, which gave him a natural advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Squeak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snake chain wrapped around Alexander frantically, and countless snakes bit Alexander's body fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke couldn't help but be overjoyed. Even if it were an elephant, it would definitely die if so many snakes bit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was disappointed. There was a shield formed by the Force on Alexander's body, which prevented the poisonous snakes from hurting Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The snake chain exploded, blood rained down all over the sky, and countless poisonous snake fragments fell and burned wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the surrounding temperature rose rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The originally dark forest became as bright as day under the coverage of the burning Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke was completely frightened and turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander appeared behind him like a ghost and thrust his palm like a knife into Locke's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke's face was ashen, and he looked terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shouted softly. With the Force vibrating, Locke's heart broke into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locke screamed and wanted to resist, but his body was limp, and he couldn't muster any strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly lowered his head and saw that the left side of his chest had collapsed entirely, leaving only a mass of rotten flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that woman was also killed by Marvin and Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, there was unrest in the branch. The Mafia members sensed something was wrong and prepared to escape in the heavy rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they had already been surrounded, and anyone who went out was shot dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep inside the branch, there was a beautiful woman in her twenties, looking at the surveillance screen with a severe expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, a bald man led more than a dozen fully armed men, each of whom was holding a weapon tightly, with an anxious expression, and looked towards the door from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hawkins, we'll escort you out. It will be too late if you don't leave now!" the bald man said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman was Vivian Hawkins, the only daughter of Mafia Godfather, Brandon. She was just visiting </span><span>Kylaville</span><span>, but she didn't expect to be attacked by Alexander.</span></p></div>
