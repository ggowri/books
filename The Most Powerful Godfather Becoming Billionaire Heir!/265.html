        <h1>Chapter 265 Blackmail</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander hurried to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!" Ashley exclaimed with joy as soon as she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a period of careful treatment and rest, Ashley was looking much better. Alexander felt a wave of happiness as he held his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dear, you'll be able to leave the hospital in just two weeks. Then you can come live in a big house with Daddy, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley replied in her sweet, childlike voice, "Okay, will Aunt Ava be living with us too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was momentarily taken aback, unsure how to respond. But Ashley continued, "When you were away, Aunt Ava was so kind to me. She visited me every day. And I know Mom and Dad aren't together anymore... It's okay, Dad, I just want to be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Alexander's eyes as he hugged his understanding daughter tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Ashley was improving, she was still quite weak. After chatting for a while, she started to feel sleepy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently encouraged her to rest and stayed by her side until she fell asleep. Then he went to check on Lily's discharge from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is my aunt's villa ready?" Alexander asked Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty promptly replied, "Yes, it's all set. It's in Ballad, just a short drive from your house, so visiting will be easy. There's 24-hour security, and I've arranged for additional discreet protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded, pleased. He was determined to ensure Lily's safety and comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, Ashley, and Ava were the most important people in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander opened the door to the ward, he was surprised to see Nick and his wife, Mia, there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily quickly interjected, "Alexander, Nick and Mia have promised to change their ways. They've been helping me here these past few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was skeptical. He didn't trust Nick to truly change, suspecting there was a hidden agenda. But seeing Lily's hopeful smile, he decided not to ruin her optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Nick and Mia, Alexander asked Betty to arrange for a car to take Lily home to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing about the move to the villa in Ballad, Nick's eyes lit up with excitement, and Mia gave him a knowing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let us live with you too. Family should stick together, right?" Nick suggested eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily hesitated, "Alexander, we don't need to live in a villa. Even though you've done well with the magic powder, you should save..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Nick interrupted, "Mom, don't be so selfless! My leg was broken because of Alexander, and it still hasn't fully healed. You've done so much for him, and he's wealthy now. A villa is the least he can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nick gave Alexander a sharp look. He and Mia had planned to manipulate Lily into asking Alexander for money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Nick had learned a lot about Alexander's success in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, especially with the magic powder. They pretended to be repentant to win Lily's favor, hoping to benefit financially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia chimed in, "Mom, Alexander's rich now; he will take care of us. Nick lost his job at the bank because of him. We have no income now. Maybe Alexander could give us $10,000... </span><span>no</span><span>, $20,000 a month for living expenses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's extortion!" Betty snapped. Several men immediately surrounded her, glaring at Mia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia hid behind Lily, shouting defiantly, "Alexander, what's this? Am I wrong? We've been taking care of Lily non-stop. Where have you been? Why weren't you here?"</span></p></div>
