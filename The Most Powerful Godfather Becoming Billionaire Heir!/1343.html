        <h1>Chapter 1343 The Emissary</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Alexander spotted several carriages entering the pine forest. He quickly marked the ground discreetly, activated the Force, and used his transformation technique to glide toward the trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped into the forest, an uneasy feeling washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bathed in the moonlight filtering through the pines, he observed four or five Risunese surrounding an elderly fellow of their kind, as if they had been anticipating his arrival for quite some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration welled up in Alexander; he realized that he had likely been spotted due to the late hour and the sparse traffic on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Risunese suddenly charged toward him, brandishing a long, narrow sword that shimmered ominously in the moonlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with this Risunese's footwork? It's oddly feminine," Alexander thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Risunese swung the sword, slicing through the air toward Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summoning his internal energy, Alexander channeled the spiral Force down to his feet. He executed a light leap, ducked his head, and felt the dragon on his spine coil and release. In an instant, he shot like an arrow, narrowly evading the sword's path and landing in the soldier's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists connected squarely with the Risunese's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, the Risunese screamed, flying backward several feet before crashing down, unable to rise, his sword slipping from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Reece fumed, drawing his sword from his waist. Just as he was about to advance, Arturo grabbed him by the arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't take him on!" Arturo stepped forward from the group, hands clasped behind his back, his expression dark. He turned to Alexander and asked, "You've got skills. Why not join us? We can offer you wealth and women to your heart's content."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression hardened; an inexplicable chill ran down his spine. It felt as if a venomous snake was watching him, ready to strike at any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but push himself to the limit, channeling the Force to surge through him. Taking a steady stance, he exhaled and declared, "Cut the crap! Let's fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within Arturo. Without hesitation, he moved, his hands coiling like snakes as he launched a punch toward Alexander's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Alexander barely managed to shield his face with his arms. The impact was thunderous, reverberating in his ears. His entire body went numb; his arms fell back as if they were detached, and he felt his skull on the verge of shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that critical moment, the golden emblem on Alexander's left chest radiated warmth, a powerful surge coursing through him, washing away the numbness and pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gathered a breath of Force, twisting his body, and seized the moment to counter with a punch from his left hand, deflecting Arturo's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo staggered backward, resembling a bowstring being released, venomous foam spewing from his mouth. His hands, still snake-like, launched a relentless barrage toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo's attack was fierce and relentless. Retreat was not an option; doing so would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander roared defiantly. The vortex of Force swirled within him, drawing energy from every corner of his being. He inhaled deeply, ready to unleash his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscles tensed, and his palms glowed a brilliant green. He grasped a sword, the sounds of wind and thunder accompanying him as he faced the looming shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of explosive bangs erupted around him; Alexander's clothes were torn to shreds, blood spewing from his mouth as he crashed into four or five pine trees, catapulting backward over 100 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hitting the ground hard, Alexander lay there, ashen-faced, his bones and meridians screaming in agony, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was a level-three warrior, his strikes were delivered at lightning speed, yet Arturo's speed surpassed his, a chilling synchronization of mind and body, his bones as unyielding as steel. A mere brush against him felt as if it would break Alexander's bones. It dawned on him that Arturo must be a level-four warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the golden warmth to bolster him today, Alexander knew he was at great risk of being killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Arturo looked at Alexander, sprawled on the ground over a hundred feet away. He lowered his left hand to retrieve a small bronze plate and several bills that had fallen from Alexander's tattered clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hand, the bronze plate measured 5.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. The front was engraved with the image of a man and woman embracing, while the back bore the words "Royal" and "Secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo suddenly appeared before Alexander, bowing slightly. "I had no idea you were the emissary. My apologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander was gearing up for a full counterattack, he was caught off guard by Arturo's unexpected apology. Confusion clouded his mind; was this man insane?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced up to see Arturo holding the familiar bronze plate. Panic struck as he checked his own pockets, realizing the plate he had retrieved from Finn was no longer there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A revelation hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander quickly composed himself, spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, then slowly rose to his feet, feigning surprise. "Could it be that you are..."</span></p></div>
