        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias pressed his palms together and smiled warmly. "If you bow to me, I'd say I'm worthy of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a clear voice rang out from outside the meditation room. "Master, inner disciple Jaryl requests a drop of Divine Liquid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elias frowned slightly and said in a calm voice, "Let him in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora who had opened the monastery gate earlier stepped inside, leading Jaryl in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? That scent... is it Divine Liquid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl's gaze locked onto Alexander and Logan, his expression a mix of shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steadying himself, he stepped forward and bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Jaryl, have undertaken demon-slaying missions for five years under the Hall of Demon Suppression, accumulating five million martial virtue points. I have also prepared a combined ten million in gold and silver. I request a single drop of Divine Liquid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt his heart pound, his face flushing with excitement. Could the four or five drops in that small jade vial really be Divine Liquid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Liora, take these two young benefactors to Gracehaven Hall. They may each select three items. Chat with them along the way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora gasped, then quickly muttered a few prayers to Avalokiteshvara before leading Alexander and Logan out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaryl turned slightly, casting a glance at the two of them. His eyes flickered with surprise, doubt... and just a hint of greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan followed Liora toward Gracehaven Hall, walking along a winding path surrounded by thousands of towering purple bamboo stalks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lush greenery stretched toward the sky. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, and the autumn sunlight filtered through, scattering golden flecks across the path. It was a truly serene scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike her usual quiet demeanor in the meditation hall, Liora chattered non-stop. Perhaps it was because they were all young, making it easier to find common ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora playfully winked at Alexander. "Are you two related to Father Elias or something? Divine Liquid is the monastery's greatest treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one drop, diluted in a bath, is enough to help someone break through their martial limits. But you? Not only did you get a few drops, you also get to pick three more items from Gracehaven Hall! Most people can't even get one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, chubby benefactor, Father Elias actually told me to chat with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Logan both shrugged and exchanged glances. "No way, this is our first time meeting him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Come on, tell me! I swear I won't tell anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora had a real talent for gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan patted his belly and shouted, "We flew here from another world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora covered her mouth, giggling. "Haha, you're such a liar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rolled his eyes and said lazily, "Believe it or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Liquid is incredibly rare. You haven't reached the Divine Transformation stage yet, have you? You should keep it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked curiously, "Why should we keep it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liora's face turned solemn as she explained, "A level-five warrior enters the Divine Transformation stage when their golden core ascends, awakening divine consciousness. Divine Liquid can heal fatal injuries and help one surpass martial limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But its true value lies in healing spiritual wounds and strengthening divine awareness. It can accelerate one's entry into the final stage of divine perception. If someone truly comprehends it... that would be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Hall of Lives, Jaryl's face twisted in rage, his eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I spent five long years and still couldn't get a single drop of Divine Liquid. This is unacceptable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Divine Liquid, how will I ever strengthen my divine consciousness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait! Those two Outer Court disciples..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened. He turned to his follower and ordered, "Find out who those two were&mdash;the tall one and the chubby one who just entered the Hall of Lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The follower immediately blended into the crowd to gather information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside Gracehaven Hall, Liora was explaining to the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first floor has sandalwood medicine shelves filled with various herbs, formulas, and elixirs. You may each select three items. The second floor is off-limits to anyone who isn't an inner disciple. Also, the Hall of Lives can prepare custom prescriptions if needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Logan wasn't an Outer Court disciple, he could only stay outside, chatting idly with Liora. Alexander, however, stepped into the hall alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first floor of Gracehaven Hall spanned over thirty feet in length and width, packed with countless shelves, each neatly categorized and labeled with detailed descriptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander browsed through the selection carefully... Huh? There was Docpirin here too! A bottle contained three pills and cost 100,000 silver coins or 1,000 martial virtue points. Expensive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he should check out the thousand-year ginseng instead&mdash;he could mix his own medicine if needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single thousand-year ginseng cost 100,000 silver coins or 1,000 martial virtue points... Refining Marrow Pills and Essence Blood Powder&mdash;both seemed like good choices. Right now, increasing his strength was the most important thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both cost 100,000 silver coins per bottle or 2,000 martial virtue points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at the thousand-year ginseng and the two white porcelain bottles in his Dimensional Pouch and let out a sigh.</span></p></div>
