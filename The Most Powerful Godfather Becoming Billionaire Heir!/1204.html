        <h1>Chapter 1204 Still Defiant</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's face turned stone-cold as he shot Sienna a harsh glare. He gave a sharp nod, and officers immediately moved in to slap handcuffs on her wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Sienna's face, but Christopher just let out a weary sigh as his officers led her away without room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the microphone and addressed the crowd. "Today was supposed to be a great day for </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> music festival. I never expected we'd witness such a heinous incident. But let me assure you&mdash;the police department won't cover for any criminal, no matter who they are. Justice will be served!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd remained dead silent as his words hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few scattered claps broke the silence after a long moment. Then, the applause gradually swelled, spreading through the audience like a wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people despised entitled brats like Sienna, who used their family name to bully others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The growing applause showed just how much the crowd approved of Christopher's stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched Christopher with an amused smile playing on his lips. "Aren't you pretty tight with the Rhodes family? Won't this cause some awkward conversations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat beaded on Christopher's forehead as he forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, don't be ridiculous! While I maintain good relations with the Rhodes family, I stand firmly for justice and the law. Please don't misunderstand my position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher bowed his head respectfully as he spoke. Alexander had immense influence in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. When people said Alexander could move mountains with a word, </span><span>they weren't exaggerating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every power player in town counted themselves lucky to call him a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. Very good," Alexander said with an approving nod. "If you ever need anything, come to me directly. I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher's heart soared at those words. Alexander's promise made everything he'd done today worth it. With Oliver's retirement approaching, Christopher had his eyes on his position. Having Alexander put in a good word would make that transition so much smoother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to bark orders at his officers. "What are you guys waiting for? Get them out of here! We need this music festival back on track."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Christopher, please!" Sienna's voice cracked with desperation. "Let me go. My dad will make it worth your while! Why are you arresting me when he's the one who attacked us? Everything hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna threw a fit as they tried to get her into the patrol car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lifetime of being spoiled rotten had shaped her into someone who dished out abuse but couldn't take it. At twenty-something, this was her first taste of consequences, and she was losing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crushing reality of not only being humiliated by Alexander but also getting arrested was more than her ego could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her in the car, now!" Christopher snapped at his officers. He could see them tiptoeing around her status, trying to handle her with kid gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fed up with their hesitation, Christopher stormed over and personally shoved Sienna into the back of the patrol car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're such hot stuff?" Sienna screamed at Alexander through the window. "Just wait until my father hears about this! The Rhodes family won't let this slide. You're going to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher fought the urge to slam his head against the steering wheel. This woman's stupidity was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few of the injured thugs, still nursing their wounds, decided to try their luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what about him? He beat us up, too. Shouldn't he be arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he broke my leg! Take him in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They pointed accusingly at Alexander, their voices rising above the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! You jump someone, and now you're trying to play the victim?" The officer's voice cut through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police showed no mercy to the attackers. Their batons cracked down hard on the thugs' backs, making them howl in pain. Like rats fleeing from a cat, they scrambled to pile into the police cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly turned his attention to Sienna, and the entire crowd held their breath. All eyes locked onto him as the tension in the air thickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took his time, walking toward the police car with measured steps, his eyes never leaving Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's body instinctively pressed back against the car as terror crept across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lips curved into a deceptively pleasant smile. "I thought I taught you a lesson back there, but clearly, you're still not getting it. You know, I've never met </span><span>anyone as thick-headed as you. Keep pushing my buttons, and let's see if the Rhodes family stays standing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words dripped with cold menace, carrying such intense killing intent that Sienna's skin broke out in goosebumps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mouth opened to snap back at him, but her body had other ideas. Her teeth chattered uncontrollably, and the words died in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christopher smacked Sienna upside the head, his voice sharp with anger. "If you dare challenge Mr. Hawthorne again, even I won't be able to save you. Your whole family will go down with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna finally fell silent. She hung her head like a frightened child, tears streaming down her face.</span></p></div>
