        <h1>Chapter 1393 Poison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Schneier, you have such powerful internal energy, a level-five warrior!" Alexander glanced at Fermin, feeling shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wore an iron helmet and refined iron armor, with a steel-alloy rod in his hand. His eyes were bright, and he looked high-spirited. It was every man's responsibility to defend the country. These 500 thousand soldiers were all brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, Sellers, Enoch, and Hogan were Fermin's guards, standing behind Fermin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin waved his sword and shouted, "Sacrifice to the flag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, some soldiers dragged over several howling Risunese and chopped off their heads under the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three cannons rang out in the field, and the army set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the drill ground, the roadsides were filled with Darwin civilians. Some were holding cakes, some were carrying water, and some were stuffing boiled eggs into the soldiers' hands. All the civilians were cursing these Risunese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rode a bay horse. Seeing this scene, he was moved. The soldiers in his country on the earth were also beloved by the people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The army of 500 thousand people and countless supplies and gear advanced mightily. They passed through the Teleportation Plates in numerous relay stations on the road and headed towards Silvester, a major town on the southwest coast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marshal's Mansion, Raegan let Madden's head rest on her plump breasts and massaged his shoulders and arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raegan narrowed her beautiful eyes and smiled, "Mr. Wetherall, at the trading conference, I spent 1.8 million silver coins on Corrosive Powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a black-clothed servant came in and reported, "Mr. Wetherall, the government's army has set off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!" Madden squeezed Raegan's hands and said impatiently, "Send the Corrosive Powder to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Wetherall." Raegan walked out of the room and went to the backyard. Soon, a huge, black vulture flew towards the southwest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five days later, the army arrived at Silvester, a major town on the southwest coast, tens of thousands of miles away from Darwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gate opened, and Richie Wetherall, the general of Silvester, along with all the officers, and Rodney Stuckey, the ambassador of Xhantao, welcomed the army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richie was extremely enthusiastic. He helped Fermin dismount from his horse and said respectfully, "Mr. Schneier, I'm Richie Wetherall, the general of Silvester."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin helped Richie up and said warmly to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carefully looked at Richie. Richie was about 40 years old, tall, and burly. There was a centipede-like scar on his square face, and his eyes revealed a fierce aura. He wore a black iron helmet, black armor, and a red cape, which was fluttering in the wind. Richie's internal energy was no less than Fermin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richie welcomed all the officers into the city to rest. The 500 thousand soldiers set up camps outside the city. The camps stretched for 30 miles with strict order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, a pot-bellied lieutenant was reporting to Richie in the study of the General's Mansion, "Mr. Wetherall, what you ordered has been done. The government's army's rations are ready, and half of them have been mixed with Corrosive Powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richie said, "Well done. You can go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lieutenant opened the door and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richie smiled coldly, with a murderous look in his eyes. He picked up a pen, wrote something on a slip of paper, and put it into a bamboo tube. Then, he left the study, tied the tube to the leg of a vulture in the courtyard, and released it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three people in the guest room of the General's Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin took out two palm-sized round emerald-inlaid gold plates. Mysterious and complex characters were engraved on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin said, "We will enter Xhantao tomorrow. Things are unpredictable. They are medium-sized Teleportation Plates. You can transmit over a thousand miles. You two find a hidden place to set up them as a way out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander and Sellers looked at each other, stepped forward to take the two Teleportation Plates, and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning, amidst the farewell sounds of the soldiers and civilians of Silvester.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin led the army, passed through the long-distance super-large Teleportation Plate in the camp of the Silvester defenders, and headed towards Campbell, a major town in Xhantao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the general's mansion of Campbell, Fermin sat in the main seat. Alexander and other guards stood behind him. Both sides were the officers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin took a sip of coffee and asked, "Mr. Stuckey, is Hamish surrounded?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney Stuckey stood up abruptly and said anxiously, "Mr. Schneier, Hamish is almost surrounded. Please send troops quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged general sneered, "A month ago, the enemy was still thousands of miles away. How could Hamish be about to be lost so quickly? You are good for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rodney blushed and remained silent.</span></p></div>
