        <h1>Chapter 347 Take a Shower</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander deliberately concealed James' death and did not reveal that he was a Warrior. These were his trump cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany became more interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His master is a Warrior, so it's very likely that he'll become a true Warrior in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said seriously, "Anyway, I won't deceive you. It's good to be proactive. It will be nice if nothing goes wrong with the research of the Red Umbrella Group. Otherwise, there will be chaos. By that time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin stopped in mid-sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany asked curiously, "Grandpa, what exactly is the Red Umbrella Group researching? You've mentioned several times that they will affect all of humanity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. Just be more proactive towards Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin patted Brittany on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed but did not object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quentin left, a young woman next to her frowned and said, "Ms. Thompson, don't Warriors only exist in fiction movies? How could there be real ones? Mr. Thompson wanted you to have more contact with Alexander, so he deliberately tricked you into taking the initiative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany snorted and glared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although you are close to me, remember your identity and mind your language."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman panicked and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back. I don't need you to accompany me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dismissing her personal assistant, Brittany stepped into the elevator alone and pressed the button for Alexander's floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pupil of a Warrior? No wonder he could even discover such strange witchcraft insects. Alexander, let me unveil your mystery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the elevator arrived at the target floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany headed towards Alexander's room and rang the doorbell, but there was no response for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put her ear to the door and listened in confusion, only to find that it was quiet inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a hotel cleaner came over. Brittany stopped her, took out a stack of bills, and handed it to her with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I forgot to bring my room card. Could you help me open the door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cleaner took the bills and opened the door with her card without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Brittany entered, Alexander, who was meditating, opened his eyes and glanced at the door fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was puzzled to discover that the person who sneaked in was Brittany. Then, he continued to close his eyes and pretend to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked in quietly and was startled to see Alexander sitting cross-legged in deep thought.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a moment, she did not disturb him but obediently sat down and waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suite was very large, with a bedroom and a living room. The big bed was covered with snow-white sheets, and all kinds of electrical appliances were available. It was definitely a five-star standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the walls of the bathroom was actually made of glass, which was polished to a bright, transparent finish. If someone was taking a shower inside, people outside would be able to see it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany thought of something and couldn't help flushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming that she had no ill intentions, Alexander slowly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Thompson, how did you come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pretended to be surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed and replied quickly, "You didn't close the door, so I pushed it open and came in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I remember I closed the door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed even more and said coquettishly, "You didn't. Why would I lie to you? My grandfather asked me to take you out. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's scorching. I'm sweating from walking. Please let me take a shower here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany headed towards the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was bewildered. What did she mean? Did she sneak in just to borrow his bathroom for a shower?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Brittany, Quentin's granddaughter, tried to seduce him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but feel more expectant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let your imagination run wild. It's just so hot that I'm sweating. You're not allowed to come in..." Brittany warned with a red face before slipping into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the bathroom had a glass wall, there was a shower curtain inside. Otherwise, it would be like performing a striptease in front of Alexander.</span></p></div>
