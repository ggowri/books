        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly realized the ambiguity in her words and blushed, leaning against Alexander's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, as you can see, Sean wants me dead. Will you help me fight him? I'm willing to pay any price, even if it means offering myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she finished, Norma leaned into Alexander's ear, her breath warm, voice sultry like a purring cat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could only smile. This woman was truly set on seducing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where's Sean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was startled. "What? You're going to act now? We need a plan, to strategize, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pressed closer to Alexander, and the two walked slowly through the hallway, heading for her office to talk in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin and a few Dragon Gang bodyguards followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few more bodyguards walked ahead of Alexander and Norma, keeping others at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a seemingly average-looking man emerged from a group of gamblers passing by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept his head slightly lowered, appearing as just another gambler, walking briskly toward Alexander and Norma without drawing any suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin suddenly focused on the man, sensing an intense, murderous aura that seemed to strangle him, making every hair on his body stand on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the same terror as being in a sniper's crosshairs&mdash;inescapable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin was highly skilled now, his sensitivity to murderous intent far surpassing that of ordinary fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander appeared oblivious, continuing forward without even glancing at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was even more unaware, still whispering softly into Alexander's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards ahead noticed the man walking briskly toward them and immediately grew angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Idiot! Watch where you're going! How dare you block the boss' path."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man suddenly roared, like a tiger descending a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards flinched, their steps halting as they froze, faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a formidable assassin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly, his cold gaze locking onto the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an ordinary face, one that wouldn't hint at his deadly nature if not for the exposed killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alexander had noticed him long ago; the man exuded a bloodthirsty aura deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary people might never encounter such an aura in their lifetime, nor understand its true fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a terror unleashed through cold eyes and expressions, one that made people shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spring-like sparkle in Norma's eyes turned to sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Norma's vision blurred as the man seemed to float toward them like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It only looked like floating because he moved so quickly, leaving a trail of afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was still several miles and a few bodyguards away from Alexander and Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the man darted past the bodyguards and appeared in front of Norma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin roared, "I know who you are! You're the Killer King! One of the top-ranked assassins, the slaughterer among mercenaries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin stepped forward, blocking the Killer King's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a top assassin, skilled in martial arts rather than firearms, making him far more difficult to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King sneered, stepping with an odd rhythm, nimbly evading Marvin and reaching Norma's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fool! Get back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin yelled and swung a fierce hook behind him, the force whistling as it aimed for the Killer King's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Killer King smirked, ducking low with an unnaturally awkward movement, dodging Marvin's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, a small katana appeared in the Killer King's hand, which he drove mercilessly toward Norma's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clash lasted only a moment, with the Killer King gaining a slight advantage, as Marvin was more skilled in long-range assassination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma was seconds away from being killed by the thrust of the blade!</span></p></div>
