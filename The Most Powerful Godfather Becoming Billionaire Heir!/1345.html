        <h1>Chapter 1345 Devils</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The church was magnificent and charming, perched atop a hill. "Walgus Church" was boldly inscribed above the grand entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few Risunese and a priest suddenly appeared at the door. Upon seeing Arturo and his companions, they quickly approached to offer their greetings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront was an elderly priest with nine scars adorning his head, puffy eyes, long eyebrows, and a white beard, dressed in a simple robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a warm smile, he introduced himself, saying, "I'm Raylan Glozier. I've been eagerly awaiting your arrival."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo responded with a hearty laugh, "Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then introduced Raylan to Alexander, saying, "This is Alexander Hawthorne, the secret envoy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raylan smiled politely and said, "A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was taken aback but maintained his composure, replying, "Nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group ushered the women into Walgus Church.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the meditation room of Walgus Church was lavishly decorated. In the center stood a table adorned with an array of exquisite delicacies. Seated around the table were four individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Raylan was a young boy, Zamir, around 11 or 12 years old, holding a glass of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo raised his glass and toasted to Alexander, "Mr. Hawthorne, here's to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted his glass with a smile, "I didn't expect this place to be so prosperous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all thanks to Mr. Burkart and Mr. Glozier." Reece chimed in with flattery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo's brow furrowed as he cautiously asked, "Mr. Hawthorne, what mission brings you here? I will certainly assist you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment and replied, "It's not that I wish to keep it a secret, but it's a matter of great significance. It concerns the Marshal's Mansion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled softly before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo's expression shifted to shock, "I apologize. Let's not delve into such sensitive matters. Let's focus on enjoying our drinks instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran through Alexander. Could it be the Marshal's Mansion, Finn, Julius, or...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, a Risunese entered from outside, carrying a large steamer with both hands, placing it respectfully on the table. A delightful aroma wafted through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo erupted in laughter. "It was finally served! Mr. Hawthorne, you must try this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Reece lifted the lid of the steamer, releasing a plume of hot air infused with an unusual smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander leaned in for a closer look, nearly dropping his fork in horror. Inside the steamer lay an infant, perfectly steamed, its eyes closed and body covered in a blend of spices and herbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander's head felt heavy, and his lips were dry. A wave of anger surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was utterly inhumane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, but he forced himself to remain calm and surveyed the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo wore a look of delight, Reece had drool pooling at the corners of his mouth, and Raylan stared with eager, gleaming eyes. The only one showing any sympathy was Zamir, who stood quietly beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, Alexander set down his fork, pressed a hand to his forehead, and feigned discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo paused, concern creeping into his voice. "Mr. Hawthorne, are you feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander deliberately manipulated the Force, his face shifting from pale to flushed. He managed a strained smile, "No, it's just that I didn't sleep at all last night, and the intense battle left me feeling a bit dizzy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arturo quickly instructed Zamir, "Zamir, help Mr. Hawthorne to his room to rest, and bring him the healing medicine prepared by Mr. Glozier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir retrieved a small bottle from a wooden box beneath the bed and approached Alexander to assist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander followed Zamir to the guest room, he heard the sounds of laughter behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guest rooms at Walgus Church were modest but clean, equipped with tables, chairs, and beds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning back against the bed, Alexander closed his eyes. Zamir lowered his head slightly and offered the small bottle, speaking softly, "Mr. Hawthorne, this is Docpirin, a unique sacred medicine from Walgus Church. It will heal your wounds and boost your strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander accepted the pill, he noticed Zamir's eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plan struck Alexander's mind. He suddenly exclaimed, "Zamir, do you think eating people is cruel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zamir staggered back a few steps, his face draining of color, shaking his head in horror, "No... no..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stood up and began to walk towards the door, saying, "I'm going to speak with Arturo and Raylan about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zamir's face turned crimson, and his eyes were wide with terror. In a swift motion, he drew a silver dagger from his clothing and plunged it towards Alexander's back.</span></p></div>
