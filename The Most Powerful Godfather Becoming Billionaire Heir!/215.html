        <h1>Chapter 215 Villain</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled coldly and did not comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not naive at all. He came here today just to see what</span><span> </span><span>Aiden was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a plan. If he could support Julia and Xavier to control the Ulysses family, it would be very helpful for him to collect gems in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I want you to represent our family in a fight with the Carter family to keep the control of Gemstone Street."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly realized that Aiden wanted to use him. No wonder Aiden was so attentive, inviting Alexander to dinner and giving him a gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said calmly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you are so sincere, I will help you. But please give me the gemstone you promised first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden immediately took out an exquisite gift box and pushed it to Alexander reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander opened it. It was indeed a top-quality ruby. Although it was not big, it was valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica taunted, "Since you've accepted our gem, you have to win. If you can't, you'll have to pay double the compensation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her a cold look and said, "Okay, I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish us a happy cooperation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden laughed and applauded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden, Angelica, I'm back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, an excited male voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned around and saw a handsome man in his twenties striding in, looking exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, why are you back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Angelica saw him, she rushed over excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, weren't you learning boxing? Why did you come back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin patted her ass and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My studies are finished. I heard that the Carter family was going to have a fight with us, I rushed back immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden asked, "Kevin, really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden stood up excitedly. Kevin's skills must be very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said, "But the person the Carter family hired is very powerful and difficult to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin laughed contemptuously and said, "Don't worry, Aiden. My teacher said that with my skills, I can rank among the top three in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he pressed his palm on the solid wood table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A clear palm </span><span>print</span><span> actually appeared on the hard table top, which showed how powerful and terrifying this palm print was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was suddenly inexplicably excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kevin, did your teacher really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin said, "Of course. Don't worry. No matter who the Carter family hires, they are no match for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin patted his chest and made the promise confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great! You have worked hard for twenty years and finally made it. With you, our family will be better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden patted Kevin's shoulder hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica pointed at Alexander and shouted arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the gem here and get out of here. Kevin is back. We don't need a piece of trash like you to help us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Aiden coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said with a fake smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, do you hear what Angelica said? Put the gem down and apologize to my daughter before you can leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. This family was so similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden was a hateful villain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin asked, "Aiden, who is he? What does he do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin looked at Alexander in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aiden said with a gloomy face, "This guy bullied Angelica and was going to take our family's top-quality gemstone. He's abominable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was furious. He strode up to Alexander and sternly ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Angelica. Otherwise, I will teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the ones who should apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander answered simply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin looked Alexander up and down and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are weak but very brave. Aren't you afraid I'll hit you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked down on it and left with the gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your reward for changing your mind. As long as you can stop me, it'll be fine. Don't fight with me. I'm warning you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin got angry was about to take action, but he was stopped by Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aiden, you were the ones who invited us to dinner and gave us the gem. Now you regret it. You've gone too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said angrily.</span></p></div>
