        <h1>Chapter 683 Forced Retreat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, clad in designer attire and exuding confidence, walked with a commanding presence beside the white-haired elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder held a crown crafted from white bone and placed it reverently on Felix's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Felix donned the bone crown, something astonishing happened. The entire Demon Summoning Array trembled, and even Treasure Island itself seemed to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister, otherworldly aura emanated from Felix, spreading outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His presence became overwhelmingly powerful, both psychologically and physically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William, hiding in the shadows, nearly lost their cover due to the force of the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the screen of his phone, Alexander could sense Felix's amplified strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this Demon Summoning Array wasn't even fully operational yet. Once when it was done, it would provide Felix with a formidable power boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned </span><span>serious,</span><span> his gaze fixed on the unfolding scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder then produced a black tome, chanting a solemn incantation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange melody began to echo through the air. Though there was no visible source, everyone could hear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a melody that seemed to come from another world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And an unbearable stench filled the air, forcing everyone on the site to cover their noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William were no exception, the combination of the eerie music and the foul odor causing a deep unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This array really does look powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, another figure in a black cloak watched the proceedings from the shadows. It was Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes wide, Shadow looked pale and shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That old fool Rock... he's actually capable of summoning demonic power? Has Anthony Hawthorne lost his mind, making a pact with demons? This is madness..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the clear sky darkened as thunderclouds gathered above, filling the air with the sound of rolling thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning flashed, and a storm seemed imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the most terrifying was that the dark clouds and lightning were confined to the area above the array while the rest of the sky remained perfectly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if some kind of miracle had occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within one or two minutes, the storm abruptly vanished, and the sky returned to its previous sunny state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix, visibly thrilled, asked, "Mr. Rossetti, why did you stop? I felt an endless surge of strength throughout my body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder chuckled darkly. "No rush. The array isn't complete yet. I merely wanted to test the effectiveness of the Ancient Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that the Ancestral Sorcerer's Staff and the Spirit Bead Bracelet are still in Alexander's possession. Otherwise, with the grimoire, I could summon an even greater power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix grinned wickedly. "Even that brief surge was strong enough to kill Alexander. By the way, who originally owned this grimoire?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock cast him a meaningful look, his tone flat. "Never ask again. The more exalted the source, the less the name should be spoken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix gave an awkward smile. "Of course, my apologies for overstepping."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two of them entered the central elevator shaft and disappeared from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Augusta, William, leave the area immediately. Do not return until I've arrived on Treasure Island!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice came through the phone, tense and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta protested, reluctant to withdraw. "We could take out those workers and prevent them from completing the array."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice turned steely. "That's an order! Even if the array isn't complete, Felix's current strength is more than enough to kill you both, not to mention that elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect that elder is none other than Rock, the Grand Elder of the City of Sorcery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Demon Summoning Array is no ordinary formation. Within its range, their power is constantly amplified!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> until I arrive, you're to lay low and focus on defense. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Augusta and William felt frustrated, they didn't dare defy Alexander's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially William, who had just emerged from a period of closed training, having activated his rare bloodline. He had hoped to strike down the Red Umbrella Group and unleash his full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But realizing that Felix's power was significant enough to warrant Alexander's concern, he reluctantly withdrew.</span></p></div>
