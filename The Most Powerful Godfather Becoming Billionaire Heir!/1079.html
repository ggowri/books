        <h1>Chapter 1079 Targeted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled softly, "I'm interested in the technology your husband developed. Of course, I'll offer a generous fee for the technology transfer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Emma's eyes lit up with hope. "Mr. Hawthorne, if you can rescue my husband, I'll convince him to give you the all-purpose bulletproof vest technology free of charge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander merely nodded, saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Maxine heard that Alexander was only after the technology, </span><span>she looked a little upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he not interested in her at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma immediately noticed her daughter's strange reaction, and anxiety began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had </span><span>known</span><span> that Alexander wasn't Maxine's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, would Alexander truly help their family wholeheartedly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma took a deep breath and pondered carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander drove them to a five-star hotel in </span><span>Newbrook</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel had tight security measures&mdash;while Alexander went to rescue Alvin, Maxine and Emma would be safer here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alexander parked in the garage, his instincts told him something was off. It felt like they were being watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be Silver Shield Security?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Emma and Maxine hadn't noticed anything unusual. In fact, they felt particularly at ease under Alexander's protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze swept the surroundings before fixing on two black Buicks parked nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something wasn't right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful</span><span>!</span><span>" Alexander warned urgently. "We're being </span><span>stalked</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Has Silver Shield Security caught up with us?" Emma trembled in fear, her</span><span> boobs shaking</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her middle age, Emma maintained an elegant </span><span>vibe</span><span>, her skin still smooth. Her mature, graceful figure carried a natural allure that surpassed even Maxine's</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Lanny wanted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, car doors flew open on two vehicles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five masked men burst out, lunging like wolves toward Emma and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them immediately seized Emma, who had been the first to exit her car. They grabbed her arms while another assailant moved to force a black hood over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Somebody </span><span>help</span><span>!" Emma snapped out of her daze and began desperately struggling, screaming for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was also being dragged toward the black car by two masked men. Terrified, she fought against their grip while crying and calling for her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining masked thug charged at Alexander, trying to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had already jumped back into his car. He started the engine and slammed down on the accelerator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unfortunate thug rushing toward him was sent flying with a tremendous impact, crashing through one of the black car's windows and landing inside the passenger compartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other black car had barely started moving when Alexander's car slammed into it with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car skidded a dozen feet across the ground with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the kidnapper behind the wheel regained consciousness and reached to restart the engine, there was a deafening crash&mdash;the locked car door was suddenly ripped clean off its hinges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver trembled violently in fear. Before he could even process what was happening, a shadow flashed before his eyes, and Alexander appeared before him like the Grim Reaper himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you, you bastard!" the driver cursed, frantically releasing the steering wheel to reach for his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, searing pain shot through his throat. The world spun as Alexander seized him by the neck, yanked him straight out of the driver's seat, and slammed him </span><span>brutally onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver let out an agonized cry and tried to fight back. But as he lifted his head, all he saw was a black shoe sole rapidly filling his vision before it crashed down onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!" The driver collapsed to the ground, his face a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the masked men abandoned Emma and Maxine. Some drew their guns while others brandished knives, charging at Alexander with wild shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fired several shots in quick succession, but Alexander used their own companions' bodies as shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three shots, three dead accomplices. The shooter stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Alexander hurled one of the corpses at him with crushing force. His spine shattered on impact, and his body crumpled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last kidnapper, realizing he was dealing with someone lethal, turned to flee in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't bother giving chase. Instead, he kicked one of the fallen blades on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife streaked through the air like a shooting star, piercing through the final kidnapper's chest and pinning him to the ground.</span></p></div>
