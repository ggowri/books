        <h1>Chapter 697 Full Activation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock flashed a sinister grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Even though the formation hasn't fully awakened, they'll be seriously weakened once they enter the plaza. You'll definitely have a chance to wipe them all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana shot Rock an irritated glance but kept quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a whoosh, he darted out of the control room at breakneck speed, creating a sonic boom in his wake, his presence overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hana's combat abilities surpassed even those of experts in combat exoskeletons, putting him on par with Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected of Sakra Society's top assassin from the </span><span>Risun</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Showing off, Hana barely touched the ground with his toes before launching like an arrow. Instead of slowing down, his speed kicked up another notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander was calmly advancing toward the plaza with Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and William led their forces in repeated assaults, cutting down Red Umbrella Group members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more minor factions supporting the Red Umbrella Group on Treasure Island had been completely crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow and his men came to join them, their bodies covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, those two subordinates of yours are incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow pointed at Augusta and William, his face showing both amazement and deep wariness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled faintly, offering no further explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike William's bizarre abilities, Augusta was pure brute force. His body had swollen to over six and a half feet tall, with arms thicker than most people's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's skin was covered in dense black hair, each strand as hard as steel needles, making even bullets struggle to penetrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One swipe of his claws would tear any enemy to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow watched with growing excitement, tinged with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if the Godfather hadn't chosen Mr. Hawthorne as his heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power Mr. Hawthorne now commands, he could probably wipe out the entire organization."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow rubbed his hands together eagerly, burning for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, shouldn't we launch our main attack now? The Red Umbrella Group is vulnerable. Before they activate the Demon Summoning Array, we could charge in, destroy their ritual circle, and take them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained calm as he replied, "The Demon Summoning Array is awakening. They're charging the ritual stones. The array will be fully activated in just minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow's eyes flashed with worry as he warned, "They say the Demon Summoning Array can bring demonic powers into our world. Will we even stand a chance when that happens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand and said, "There's no time to stop them now. If we launch an all-out attack right when the ritual activates, we'll all be trapped in the center and become sacrifices to the demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this ritual circle is flawed and incomplete. Leave it to me to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if some dark force does show up, it'll have to cross time and space first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Despite the ritual's power, Felix is still human, not a true demon. This is going to take a toll on him, maybe even damage him permanently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That'll be our chance. Once we destroy the ritual circle, I can finish Felix off for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep dive into the Ultimate Legacy had unlocked a trove of witchcraft secrets, allowing him to see through the limitations of this Demon Summoning Array.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow nodded vigorously. "You're right. We'll follow your lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We'll go in while the others surround the plaza. No one gets away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took point, with Shadow right behind him, followed by Rosalia and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final battle was about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, William had just burst into the Red </span><span>Umbrella Group plaza</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the ground shook violently. William stumbled as the blood mist surrounding him started to dissipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vampire bats filling the sky began flying erratically, losing their coordination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta stopped in her tracks, caught in what seemed like an invisible maze. She spun in place, unable to move forward or backward as if trapped by unseen walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An eerie black mist spread across the plaza, quickly enveloping everyone in its dark embrace.</span></p></div>
