        <h1>Chapter 257 Test</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was dazed just now, she could still recall the scene where Guzman was killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a powerful man like Alexander, she could not resist. Her resentment towards Guzman also made her not want to resist at all. She was even full of gratitude to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander needed someone to run the Brilliant Group on the surface, and he just needed to control it behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By killing Guzman and annexing the Brilliant Group, he had completed half of the task of becoming the successor ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe looked at a man in black and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Max, do you plan to work for me or die with the Bryant family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max looked at Alexander fearfully and said with a complicated smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss, besides Mr. Bryant, you are the most capable one, and the rest of the Bryant family are idiots. I want to survive. Of course, I will follow you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to his men and asked, "What are your opinions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozens of men in black nodded and agreed to work for Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe nodded with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Max, I'll give each of you one million dollars, and your salary will be doubled in the future. You must keep it a secret. Anyone who dares to reveal what happened here will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max and others were ecstatic. They did not expect they would be so lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knelt on one knee to declare their allegiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe became much more relaxed after getting the support of Max.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to Alexander respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, we can announce to the public that Guzman has run into problems with his witchcraft practice and needs to be in seclusion for a long time. I will be the president of the Brilliant Group, so there won't be any trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was eager to show her abilities to Alexander and consolidate her position as president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very grateful to Alexander. If it weren't for Alexander, she would have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander watched Cloe's actions silently and was very satisfied with her ability and courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made the right choice. He needed someone familiar with Treasure Island and the Brilliant Group to help him manage everything. The one had to be not only capable but also loyal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe hated Guzman and was also shocked by Alexander's strength. Alexander believed that she would not have any other thoughts in the short term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at the Bryant family members kneeling on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They and Guzman are all in the same boat, and no one has come to plead for you just now. So, how do you think we should deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe looked at these so-called relatives with a complicated gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family members knelt in front of Cloe and kowtowed for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cloe, it was Guzman who wanted to kill you just now. Please, Guzman is dead, let us go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Cloe, do you remember? I invited you to dinner before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your uncle, Cloe. That bastard Guzman doesn't recognize you as a family, but we recognize you as a relative!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people were crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was full of anger and contempt. If any of them had persuaded Guzman just now, she would have pleaded with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one did so. These people were just watching the fun from beginning to end, and some even wished she would die sooner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was very smart. She knew that Alexander was testing her loyalty by giving her decision-making power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Max, take them all away. Don't let outsiders know that Guzman is dead. Do you know what to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max grinned grimly, worrying that he had no chance to show his loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please rest assured, I will throw them all into the sea to feed the sharks and I guarantee that the news will not leak out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the Bryant family members cried and begged desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Max's command, they were dragged away one by one without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe finally couldn't hold on due to excessive blood loss, and she passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was quick to act and hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her body was cold, it was plump and smooth. Cloe had a great figure and was still a virgin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Alexander was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara was also a virgin. After Alexander sleeps with Lara for the first time, he absorbed a lot of the Force left by James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "If I could sleep with Cloe..."</span></p></div>
