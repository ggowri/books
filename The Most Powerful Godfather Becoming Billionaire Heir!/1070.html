        <h1>Chapter 1070 Freaked Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the siege, Alexander countered back instead of retreating. Every time he struck, at least one of the men fell down with screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the wailing in pain, all of the seven men fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them covered their bellies and vomited blood, while others scratched their heads in pain. Some even rolled on the ground in convulsions. All in all, the whole scene looked miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't even mean to kill them. Otherwise, they would have gone to hell right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a bunch of idiots! You're all fooled by this woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After beating them up, Alexander turned around, only to find that cunning woman slipped away into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sneering, Alexander mumbled to himself, "Do you think you can escape? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he exerted the Force with sharp eyes and pinpointed that woman in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, that woman ran back to her home with a gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened the door with trembling hands and slumped down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped for breath since she got so exhausted from running away. Even her big breasts jolted and made her feel pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing the cup on the table, she didn't recover from the tiredness until she drank several glasses of water in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God bless! Do you think you can catch me? I wonder what happened to that handsome guy. Considering his fighting skills, he can protect himself... Right?" Maxine Duncan muttered to herself with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, sorry, cute guy. It's not your lucky day because you used all your luck to help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine leaned back on the sofa and leisurely crossed her fair legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone knocked on the door and scared her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Maxine grumbled and reluctantly got up from the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked cautiously through the door, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even doubted whether she hallucinated but soon denied this thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was a little worried as she had waited for a while but still got no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, she became suspicious of the sudden knock on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity was human instinct. Once a person's curiosity was aroused, she would not feel at ease unless she figured out what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Maxine was sure that she was safe and no one could tail her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a momentary hesitation, the curiosity got the best of her, and Maxine opened the door to observe what on earth was happening carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello! Honey, why did you run away without me? Did you cheat on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander jumped out with a smile and suddenly stood in front of Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!" Being startled, Maxine shivered and was about to shut the door when Alexander squeezed into her house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she almost fell to the ground, Alexander held her and grabbed her bulging butt, which was soft and felt good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pervert! What are you doing?" Maxine jumped away in fright with a flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing sneaking around like that? You freaked me out..." She patted her chest as he almost scared the shit out of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her big breasts shook with the pats on her chest and attracted his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a nice body, cunning fox!" Chuckling, Alexander went around her house as if taking a tour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine immediately stopped him and said, "Hey, why did you break into my house? If you have nothing particular, get out, or I'll call the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police? You called my honey in front of so many people just now, so this is also my house. Call the police if you want." Alexander saw through her hidden schemes and was not daunted by her words at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was so angry that she was even at a loss for words, and her chest heaved even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you get me a cup of water, honey?" Then, he grabbed a cup and stuffed it into her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger almost drove Maxine to smash this cup on his head. However, thinking about that he managed to trace her in the besiege, she immediately calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she poured a glass of water and smashed it on the table.</span></p></div>
