        <h1>Chapter 1088 I Will Cure You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The snake's head was crushed, and its body was wriggling and struggling in the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander knew it was a poisonous snake and wore a serious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alex, I'm scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without putting on her pants, Emma jumped up and threw herself into Alexander's arms, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be afraid. Sit down. I'll examine you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pressed Emma down on the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a few small teeth marks at the base of her fair thigh, and blood was flowing out. The blood had turned black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma's face turned blue, and her lips had turned black. She moaned, "Am I going to die? I have no strength left. My head is spinning. I feel awful..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be afraid. You won't die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With hesitation, Alexander quickly tore up Emma's pants to make it easier for him to treat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, Emma wasn't even wearing knickers. Alexander abruptly felt tightness in his crotch. He was turned on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He worked up the Force and suppressed his desire, saying, "Emma, I'm going to suck out the poison now. It might be a little painful. Please endure the pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not afraid. Help me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Emma was frightened, she was burning all over with a hint of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, she felt touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sucking out poisonous blood was very dangerous. If Alexander accidentally swallowed it or if he had a wound in his mouth, he would be poisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't hesitate and put his mouth on the wound, sucking out the poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wound happened to be near the inner thigh root, so when Alexander sucked out the poison, his nose pressed against the moist and charming part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A scent of hormones unique to a mature woman hit Alexander in the face, turning him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma trembled all over and melted under the touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander sucked out the poison, his nose tip touched her from time to time, so she went wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Alexander sucked out several mouthfuls of poisonous blood. He put the Force into Emma's body to expel all the remaining snake venom from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There. How do you feel now?" Alexander asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was soaked to the skin and collapsed on the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took a deep breath and stammered, "I don't feel well. I feel dizzy and numb..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was shocked. Did he make a mistake in the treatment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he leaned over to check on Emma, she abruptly sprang up and pressed him on the grass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Alexander knew what was happening, Emma unzipped his pants skillfully and buried her head deeply inside...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Um."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander hummed. A comfortable feeling rose up and swept through his whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was indeed experienced and skillful. She sometimes sucked, sometimes licked, and sometimes shook it fast and slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could no longer control himself, and he didn't want to control. If he didn't react, he was not a man at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ripped open Emma's shirt, and several buttons flew out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma couldn't help but exclaim. Her plump breasts were wrapped and rubbed by two warm big hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were soft and elastic and could not be covered by one hand. They kept changing into various shapes in Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander got proactive, Emma began to moan softly and shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was pressed down on the grass. She raised her legs and folded them over her chest, and Alexander pressed on her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than an hour later, the soul-stirring sound finally stopped with a high-pitched moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma snuggled naked in Alexander's arms, kissing his chest with deep affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled bitterly and sighed secretly. In the end, he failed to escape the clutches of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt his Force had grown stronger, but he was certain that the dark power was enhanced accordingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to find a way to prevent the dark power from becoming stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They rested for a while, and Alexander patted Emma's plump butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's all your fault. I haven't found the last herb yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma blushed immediately and got up to straighten her clothes with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, Alex, I lost control just now and caused you trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma lowered her head shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We did it. It's pointless saying the nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pinched her breast and rubbed it hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma was overjoyed. She straightened up her chest coquettishly and let Alexander grope her at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them wandered in the mountains for more than an hour before Alexander finally found the last herb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander quickly started the car and drove to the hotel with Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they opened the door to the hotel room, Alexander immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no. Something bad happened to them."</span></p></div>
