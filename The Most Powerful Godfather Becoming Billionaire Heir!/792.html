        <h1>Chapter 792 More Missing Cases</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine had had sex with Yinson many times, and she was very skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She understood that she must do everything she could to please men if she wanted to get more practical benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman represented the military of the Risun, and even Yinson had to curry favor with him, so Elaine was willing to serve Salman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Bowen, are you feeling well?" asked Elaine breathlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course. Yinson must have made love to you many times, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Salman reached out and pinched Elaine's breasts, pulling them hard. His heart was filled with the desire to conquer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could no longer bear it, so he stood up suddenly, picked up Elaine, and kissed her madly. Then, he pressed her on the desk and opened her legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ouch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elaine screamed in excitement, enduring the storm-like attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Loscity, Alexander got up early and turned to look at Ava, who was sleeping soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last night, under Alexander's caress, Ava had come seven or eight times. She had not recovered yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander chuckled and tiptoed out of the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rosalia sent Ashley to kindergarten, while Alexander wanted to visit the production base of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recently, half of the production lines for magic powders and beauty ointments had been shut down, and part of them were being relocated to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, do you want me to drive you?" asked Charlize expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "You must protect Ava's safety. She can't have any accidents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Charlize felt disappointed and didn't dare to say anything more, stepping aside reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander arrived outside the villa, and Betty was waiting for him at the door in a Maybach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good morning, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty greeted him excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was dressed up today, wearing a white lace shirt, which was pushed up high by her plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black hip skirt wrapped around her plump and round buttocks, revealing a pair of sexy thighs in black stockings and sparkling high heels. This outfit was both elegant and sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander got in the car and ordered, "Go to the production base. I haven't visited it for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty drove quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, Betty turned on the news report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female announcer reported the day's current affairs in a clear voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A tragedy occurred in a private house on a ranch in the suburbs of Loscity. The owner's family of six disappeared, leaving only blood on the ground. More than a hundred cows on the farm were mauled to death by unknown creatures. The police are currently investigating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The latest news is that a hunting team was attacked by an unknown beast in the Bonifa Mountains. Two men are currently unknown..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was listening to the news when he suddenly asked, "Betty, have you noticed that there have been many missing cases in the suburbs of Loscity in recent days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty was surprised, and she didn't feel anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't say anything else. He thought, "Are these missing cases related to the living dead I saw last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of minutes later, the Maybach stopped outside a vast industrial park in the suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander got out of the car, he looked around and looked at the endless Bonifa Mountains in the distance, feeling vaguely uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the direction Jake had fled with the living dead. Although Loscity seemed calm recently, Alexander knew that it was just the prelude to the coming storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He became more determined in his plan and decided to move the Ultimate Alliance headquarters to Treasure Island as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lamont Wood, who was in charge of production, had been waiting at the door with his men. Seeing Alexander and Betty, he immediately lowered his head and ran over to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Alexander became Heinrich's only heir, he had no longer concealed his identity and began to step out from behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the middle and lower levels of the Ultimate Alliance all knew that Alexander was the boss of the Ultimate Alliance and Betty was just the CEO who managed it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander temporarily put aside his worries about the living dead, walked around the factory, and nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Alexander was satisfied, Lamont finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He patted his chest and assured, saying, "Don't worry, Mr. Hawthorne. Half of our production line has been dismantled and loaded onto the ship, and we will set sail for Treasure Island today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A group of skilled workers has signed long-term employment agreements and went to the new factory in Treasure Island in advance to familiarize themselves with the situation. After the production line arrives, it will be installed immediately, and production will resume as soon as possible."</span></p></div>
