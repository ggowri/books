        <h1>Chapter 581 The Showdown</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Nancy parked, several men in black rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched the car door intently, making sure it was Nancy stepping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw it was her, everyone bowed in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They respectfully escorted Nancy and Alexander into the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Who's that guy next to the Boss? Is she dating him?" One of the bodyguards asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like it. That guy must have hit the jackpot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think the Boss is prettier than the Second Miss, but the Second Miss is a huge online star&mdash;she dances like a pro."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted among themselves, secretly envying Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, isn't Clay Burch the one who's engaged to the Boss? And he's here. This is going to be interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay Burch thinks he's all that with the City of Sorcery backing him up. He never takes us seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. I hope someone teaches him a lesson. That guy looks like he could hold his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alexander was walking away, he could still hear their conversation clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ferrari they'd passed earlier was parked nearby, along with a Rolls Royce, a Bentley, and other luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most eye-catching was a bright red sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy spotted the red car and scoffed, saying, "That's Clay Burch's ride. He's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly. "Don't worry; this time, I won't let him off easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took a deep breath to calm her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just don't mess up. Be careful with what you say and follow my lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, I'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy still felt uneasy, letting out a quiet sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped nothing would go wrong and that they could deal with Clay Burch smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two walked to the entrance, and Nancy gave Alexander a knowing look, then playfully linked her arm through his, leaning against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arm around her waist, and they made their way into the living room, looking quite cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the bodyguards and staff were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe their eyes&mdash;the usually aloof and proud Boss was openly cuddling with a man. It was unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't care about their stares, taking in the grandeur of the massive estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon had a rich history; this place had probably stood for over a century and cost a fortune to maintain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with a subtle fragrance that instantly cleared his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recognized it as a rare spice known for its invigorating properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This spice was more valuable than gold, and to have that scent wafting through the estate required millions spent on sachets placed in discreet corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, those sachets lost their fragrance after a while and needed to be replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every piece of furniture was made of precious wood, and with the craftsmanship involved, it was worth a pretty penny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mansion this size, just the furniture alone must be worth hundreds of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Kaylon really knows how to flaunt their wealth," Alexander remarked casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy </span><span>smiled,</span><span> her pride evident. She'd heard plenty of compliments before, but Alexander's made her feel accomplished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now do you see how great I am?" she teased, unable to help herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Nancy, you're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An older man in a sharply tailored suit approached, his shoes gleaming. He beamed at Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his expression changed dramatically when he noticed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Marlon, the head steward who has worked here his whole life," Nancy introduced Marlon Blackwell to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon scanned Alexander from head to toe, quickly concluding that although he was handsome and had a certain charm, he came from a humble background. His clean attire simply couldn't compare to Nancy's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did this guy really think he could ride Nancy's coattails?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders had already decided that Clay Burch was to be Nancy's fianc&eacute;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon felt a surge of disdain for Alexander.</span></p></div>
