        <h1>Chapter 228 Potential</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne led Alexander through several halls. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the bulletproof glass doors, he could see displays of exquisite jewelry, rare antiques, and even a few stunning models. These were clearly the prized possessions of the trading center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the corridor, Lynne brought Alexander to a small, highly secure hall. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was protected by two layers of bulletproof glass doors that could withstand sniper fire, and four armed guards were stationed nearby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surveillance cameras with infrared sensors monitored every angle, and hidden gun ports suggested automatic defenses inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, behold the Red Umbrella Group's most groundbreaking invention of the century&mdash;the magical potential potion!" Lynne announced, gesturing toward a large glass cabinet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cabinet, made of transparent bulletproof glass, was surrounded by an electric fence. Inside were three small vials of red liquid, each flickering faintly under the lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne's eyes shone with desire as she explained, "Anyone who drinks this potion can unlock their potential, enhancing physical strength, intelligence, and even lifespan. It can change your destiny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stepped closer to the display, examining the vials. Lynne continued her enthusiastic pitch, her gaze never leaving the potions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the price for each vial was a staggering one billion dollars, far beyond the reach of most. Even if Lynne could acquire one, she would likely sell it for a lifetime of luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had withheld one crucial detail from Alexander: the potion was far from perfect. Many who tried it became incapacitated shortly after initial success. The Red Umbrella Group had yet to fully understand these failures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of over a hundred human trials, only a few were successful. Most users ended up with severe cognitive or physical impairments. The group found that only those with exceptional physical fitness or high intelligence fared well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, a world-class sprinter used the potion, breaking records repeatedly and living without issues for months. Similarly, a 90-year-old multinational chairman with a high IQ extended his life by half a year with no adverse effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conclusion was clear: the potion's success depended on the user's attributes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander mused on the Red Umbrella Group's capabilities. They were indeed formidable, producing such an advanced product. More elusive and challenging than his rival, Guzman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the high cost, Alexander was intrigued. He considered purchasing a vial to study it further with his own methods. He wouldn't risk stealing it and alerting Guzman just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, are you interested in buying one?" Lynne asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has anyone else developed a similar drug?" Alexander inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet. The Red Umbrella Group has military backing, which provides them with unique technology," Lynne explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment. "I'm considering it, but you haven't mentioned any side effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynne's initial excitement turned to nervousness. She couldn't afford to deceive Alexander; anyone with a billion dollars to spend was not to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, I was just about to explain... Most users do experience side effects, though some don't," she admitted cautiously.</span></p></div>
