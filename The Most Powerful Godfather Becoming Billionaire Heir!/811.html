        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction. "Very good. We should expedite the design of our combat armor; if not, then we should at least develop a combat exoskeleton."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Marvin interjected, "Sir, we have captured six hundred and fifty-three people. These individuals are the elites of the Dragon Gang, and keeping them around could be a potential threat. How should we deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone was shocked. To execute over six hundred captives was indeed a shocking proposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could decide the lives of these several hundred captives with one word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a dead silence, and everyone gazed at Alexander, waiting for him to make the final decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment and said, "Killing them would be too cruel, but we can't let them go either. Since we need manpower to develop Devil's Island, let's have them stay here as laborers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, this is a really good idea," Augusta quickly agreed. He was really afraid that Marvin would incite Alexander to kill all the captives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, let them be laborers and do the dirtiest and hardest work!" someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Indeed, Sir is merciful; this is a good solution," another man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They may be spared the death penalty, but they cannot escape the punishment of hard labor!" They all reached a consensus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Alexander made his decision, the sense of oppression in his heart disappeared because he had also considered simply killing them all to eliminate future troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Alexander made the right decision; otherwise, he would have strayed from the path of righteousness and become an evil Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, are we going to develop Devil Island now? But this island has already been purchased by the Dragon Gang. What if there's a legal dispute?" Logan reminded Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment and said calmly, "If I'm not mistaken, something big is about to happen. So, I want to move the headquarters of Ultimate Alliance to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Afterward, a large amount of supplies will be transported over. One Treasure Island definitely won't be enough, but now, with Devil Island, we'll have enough space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You need to organize quickly and set up the defensive facilities on Devil Island!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander wasn't in a hurry, but the appearance of the living dead had always made him feel very oppressed, and he needed to be fully prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin scratched his bald head and said, "Sir, there's something else I need to report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander looked at him in confusion and asked, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin smiled and said, "Didn't Zora mention that the Dragon Gang has several key industries, including scrap metal recycling, arms dealing, and the adult entertainment business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I meant Risun's porn. We're all quite familiar with them, which are mostly controlled by the Dragon Gang behind the scenes..." he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was speechless, not knowing what this guy was trying to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want to say? Just come out with it. Don't beat around the bush," Alexander urged impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin said with a grin, "Sir, you're definitely going to Risun to collect iridium. Make sure to take me along. I want to broaden my horizons and see those adult film stars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Augusta and Logan couldn't help laughing out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander glared at Marvin fiercely, thinking, "What on earth is going through this guy's mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were anyone else, he would have slapped him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alexander knew that Marvin was just a foolish hothead, so he didn't bother to argue with Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Indeed, he did have plans to go to Risun to find the Dragon Gang, collect enough iridium as soon as possible, and upgrade his level-two lightsaber to level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, although Alexander couldn't become an Advanced Warrior for the time being, with a level-three lightsaber, his combat power would greatly increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Dragon Gang and Sakura Society are mortal enemies, which we can take advantage of. Although we have seized Devil Island, the enemy of our enemy is our friend," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "We must seize Devil Island, but I will pay them the money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gestured to Augusta. "Communicate with Cloe and transfer five thousand people from Treasure Island to speed up the development of Devil Island."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it, Sir!" Augusta quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Alexander ordered Logan to lead a thousand-man team to guard Devil Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Augusta and Marvin returned to Loscity with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the trip to Risun, Alexander set it within a week, with preparations to be made first.</span></p></div>
