        <h1>Chapter 907 They'll Talk</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long convoy of cars stretched around the club, sealing off every possible exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it!" Alexander declared, leading the way with Norma close behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two strode quickly toward the club's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards who were supposed to be on duty had already vanished, leaving the heavy doors shut tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp gaze swept the area. "No doubt about it. Hazel's scent is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma's face lit up, excitement flickering in her eyes. But as her thoughts drifted to those risqu&eacute; outfits and provocative toys hidden in her sister's closet, her cheeks burned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she imagined her sister inside, tangled up with some man, her glance flicked to Alexander involuntarily, and an unfamiliar heat rose within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could think too much, Alexander kicked out with a force that sent the club's heavy doors flying inward, crashing to the ground with a deafening thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunfire erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tilted his head to the side, dodging the bullet with an almost casual grace, and bolted inside with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream tore through the air as Alexander sent one of the men flying with a single kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakuragi family's men flooded in behind him, flipping on every light switch they could find. The club was bathed in harsh, glaring light, illuminating the chaos within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man and several other burly figures lay sprawled on the floor. One of them was coughing up blood, while the shattered remains of an assault rifle lay nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes landed on </span><span>Norma,</span><span> their expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the bartender, he immediately dropped his gaze, avoiding eye contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caught the subtle shift in the man's demeanor and smirked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, where's Hazel?" Alexander demanded, his voice like a blade slicing through the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a suffocating silence. The bartender kept his head low, and no one else dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma clenched her fists, anger bubbling to the surface. "Not going to talk? Fine. Then none of you are walking out of here alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man dragged himself to his feet, his face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think your Dragon Gang can just bully whoever you want! Sakra Society isn't afraid of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norma's eyes burned with rage. This guy had the audacity to play the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over Hazel right now, and we'll leave. Otherwise, you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander said Hazel was here, she believed him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled darkly. "They're not going to give her up. Let me handle this. I guarantee they'll talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing?" The middle-aged man's voice shook, though he tried to mask it with bluster. "Our men will be here any second! If you don't want to start an all-out war, leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smirk deepened as he strode toward the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of pressure seemed to radiate off him, so oppressive that the man stumbled back involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're with Sakra Society! You've got a death wish if you lay a finger on me! If you </span><span>so much as touch me, our people will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's tirade cut off as he swung a fist at Alexander, aiming straight for his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punch had some weight behind it, looking like he wasn't just an amateur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Alexander, it was almost laughable. The man's speed and strength were on par with a child's tantrum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander stood perfectly still, the man's confidence surged. Seizing the moment, he put everything he had into his punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the man's fist was about to land, Alexander moved. A single kick, precise and devastating, sent the man flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hit the ground hard several meters away, blood spurting from his mouth as he lay there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room froze. Everyone stared at Alexander, the brutal efficiency of his strike leaving them stunned and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned his cold, cutting gaze on the bartender. "You can save yourself some pain and talk now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bartender's lips curled into a sneer. His hand darted to his back, pulling a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die, you bastard!" he roared, aiming at Alexander and pulling the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sakra Society members burst into laughter, their smug satisfaction plain as they pictured Alexander dropping dead from a headshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of a gunshot, there was only the hollow click of an empty chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter died instantly. Everyone's eyes fell on Alexander, who held up the gun's magazine in one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden bullets spilled from it, clattering to the floor and rolling in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had even seen Alexander move. Somehow, he'd removed the magazine before anyone could react.</span></p></div>
