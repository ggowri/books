        <h1>Chapter 1338 Keep Working Hard</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finn was soaring through the air when he suddenly felt a crushing pressure around his waist, causing the protective barrier surrounding him to shatter. With a dull thud, a violent force surged through him, breaking his meridians and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed from his mouth as he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gaping wound at his waist, Finn writhed in agony, muttering, "I... I won't lose..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked on, his gaze steady yet laced with sarcasm. "Just die," he said slowly, his voice cold. "I'll make sure Julius joins you soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Finn's words faltered before he breathed his last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of calm, Alexander carefully scanned the grove, ensuring there were no witnesses. He then turned his attention to the four bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Alexander's face as he counted the money he'd acquired&mdash;over 10 million dollars. It was a substantial sum, a real windfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Finn had been a level-three martial arts expert and the housekeeper of the Marshal's Mansion. Along with the cash, Alexander had also stumbled upon a manual for the powerful Smashing Palm technique, a small bronze plaque, and several vials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no use for the skill himself, but he could pass the Smashing Palm Technique on to Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze plaque intrigued him; it measured 5.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide, featuring an engraving on one side of a man and woman locked in an embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man wore a lewd expression, while the woman possessed a beautiful face and an appealing figure. On the reverse side, the words "Royal" and "Secret" were inscribed, but no matter how he examined it, its purpose eluded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several small bottles bore labels like Life-Saving Pills and Corpse-Dissolving Powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dug a hole to bury the assorted swords and daggers scattered on the ground before opening a bottle of Corpse-Dissolving Powder. He sprinkled a small amount onto Finn's bloodied chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plume of green smoke erupted, and Finn's body began to corrode and dissolve, quickly transforming into a pool of black liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sealing the bottle tightly, Alexander dragged the remaining bodies over and tossed them into the dark water, watching as more green smoke billowed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander recognized the Corpse-Dissolving Powder as an essential tool for eliminating witnesses and erasing traces of his deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had disposed of the bodies and cleaned up the scene, he felt a twinge of concern for Logan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scanning the area for signs of life and finding none, he summoned the Force, employing his Spirit Step Evolution to leap towards Emerald Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes later, he arrived at Emerald Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan was sprawled on the large bed, rubbing his sleepy eyes. "What brings you here in the middle of the night?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully draped an arm over Logan's shoulders and smiled, "I missed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan grimaced. "I like women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled out a martial arts manual from his pocket and tossed it onto Logan's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked at it and asked, "Where did you get this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander recounted the entire story. Logan, fuming, waved his arms. "How dare he impersonate me to write a letter? Does he have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, you need to practice martial arts," Alexander replied. "Be cautious when I'm not around at Emerald Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Alexander. I've become a level-one warrior and received the Spiritual Awakening. I'm doing fine," Logan reassured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have 10 million dollars. If you need money, just let me know," Alexander offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm managing well here. Besides, I have my own funds. Keep the money for yourself. By the way, Alexander, I bought a small gold medal. It's quite exquisite. Do you want it?" Logan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, keep it for yourself. While it looks nice, I'm not sure what the word 'Interception' on the back means," Alexander replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them lay on the bed, chatting away. As the conversation continued, Logan drifted off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from the recent battle, Alexander soon drifted into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, he was greeted warmly by everyone at Emerald Manor, which filled him with joy. Since arriving in Sahasia, this manor had become a place of deep connection for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rubbed his nose and said with a hint of grievance, "Alexander, it's been months since I've seen you. Don't rush off. Let's hang out a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Alexander considered that he had just become a level-three warrior the day before and showed no signs of advancing to the fourth level yet. Perhaps he should take a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Call Jalen. Let's go have some fun," Alexander said, raising his hands and laughing heartily.</span></p></div>
