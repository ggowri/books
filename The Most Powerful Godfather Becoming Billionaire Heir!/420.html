        <h1>Chapter 420 Surrender</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she had an extra necklace around her neck, and the number represented that she ranked one hundred and sixteen among the women who were controlled by Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella dressed revealingly and attracted a lot of attention on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men were all excited, while the women's eyes were full of mocking and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella blushed as she hurried home and took off the quite revealing outfit. Then, she took a shower in the bathroom, seemingly to wash the dirt off her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recovered some of her spirit after the shower, and she seemed to regain her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She went back to her bedroom and lay on her bed in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to the humiliating behavior at Felix's place and how many people had seen her exposed body later, Ella even wanted to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Ella had come to her senses, she was frightened from the bottom of her heart, and she wondered why she had become that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I going to do? Do I really have to be controlled by Felix for the rest of my life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to kidnap a child..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to do such a thing, but she had signed the contract, and Felix had recorded the video. She had volunteered, and there was no one forcing her to do it </span><span>ostensibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the thought of the video being in Felix's hands made Ella feel like she was being treated like a maid, and this idea was too deep in her mind to vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated before finally picking up her cell phone and calling Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it got connected, Ella hesitated again. Before she could wait for the connection, she hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, her cell phone vibrated. At the sight of Alexander calling back, Ella didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only when Alexander called a second time did Ella shiver and pick up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Ms. Purnell, what happened when you called me? Why did you hang up so quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's masculine voice came from the other side of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella covered her mouth and almost cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, there's nothing going on. I... I just pressed the wrong button in the shower. I was shocked when you called out of the blue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Hey, so you're still that timid. I thought you were trying to ask me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alexander's joking words made Ella even more upset inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she'd lost her chance to date Alexander forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. If you're okay, I'm going to rest for a while," Ella said guiltily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander could see Ella, he would have noticed her despair and sadness, but there was no way Alexander could see through the phone even if he activated his All-Seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Ella sat there in a daze for a long time without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to work her way out of the situation, but there was nothing she could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix wanted her to kidnap and abduct Ashley and Ava, and she didn't want to do it, but there was nothing else she could do to satisfy Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, </span><span>She</span><span> couldn't get out of Felix's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella stood up and opened her closet. Looking at the wide array of clothes inside, she blushed as she remembered the style of dress Felix had asked her to wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Do I really have to do what he wants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lot of men will see my sensitive body parts, and some will even think I'm a whore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella was struggling inside, and her sense and dignity told her that she should never do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her mental consciousness had been eroded by the addiction, and she couldn't control herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella looked at herself in the mirror. Her sexy body was left with many bruises, which Felix had just left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was naked with no clothes on, and she wore a silver necklace around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had unexpectedly revealed an unprecedented mature charm, looking flirtatious and attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected this beauty to be controlled by Felix to sign a contract of sale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm sorry. I was forced to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella groveled on the bed and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she was done crying, she lay on her bed like a dead woman, staring at the ceiling with wide eyes for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ten o'clock at night at the bar when it was lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was sitting beside Betty accompanying her to meet a client.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander called Ella just now, he didn't pay attention to it even though he felt that Ella's tone was a bit strange.</span></p></div>
