        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, Alexander watched as Melin's helicopter lifted off, heading toward Louvian Port. He finally let out a long breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hadn't managed to transport all of his stockpiled supplies&mdash;worth tens of billions&mdash;to Treasure Island, at least the majority had made it there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island was a natural fortress, practically impenetrable to zombies and mutant creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the latest intelligence, the ocean creatures hadn't mutated like their land-based counterparts. Their different genetic makeup had somehow protected them. This made Treasure Island a safe haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The island's security was rock-solid. With Augusta, William, and Marvin leading several thousand elite troops, plus the hundreds of thousands of civilians already there, they could hold that position indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had made up his mind. He needed to head to Risun to track down that old bastard Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding him was their only shot at ending this apocalyptic nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the rate things were going, humanity was in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his satellite phone to call Quentin, explaining his plan and asking for help securing a military aircraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity Airport was completely overrun with monsters, and there was no telling what had happened to the civilian pilots. The military was their only option now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quentin learned of Alexander's plan, he was stunned at first, his emotions a complicated mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Alexander had always planned ahead, building two secure bases&mdash;Treasure Island and Devil Island&mdash;where they could have lived comfortably. Yet here he was, choosing to hunt down Yinson in Risun instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin couldn't help but admire Alexander's courage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Quentin called back with instructions for Alexander to wait at an abandoned airport in the northern suburbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The monsters hadn't taken over the old airport yet, and a military aircraft would land there to transport Alexander to Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flight from Loscity to Kylaville, Risun would take twelve hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the military aircraft was equipped for mid-air refueling, eliminating the need for any stops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the global catastrophe in full swing, Alexander wasn't sure they'd be able to take off again if they had to land somewhere along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, in a five-star hotel in Kylaville... Alexander was sleeping restlessly, his forehead creased with worry as he battled through what was clearly a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since parachuting into Kylaville's outskirts two days ago, he'd been fighting his way through Sakra Society's headquarters, searching exhaustively for Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This international metropolis, once home to millions, had become a playground for monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander realized he'd been too optimistic about the mission. He could only hope that Quentin and Gavin would come through with Yinson's exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting through the sea of zombies and mutant beasts outside would be exhausting, even for someone with Alexander's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Alexander woke up to a burning sensation in his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hunger gnawed at him, and his thoughts drifted to Ava and their daughter. He lay there with his hand on his stomach, eyes half-closed, struggling to separate dream from reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky outside his window was eerily dark, and below, zombies of all shapes and sizes shuffled through the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They trudged through piles of garbage and remains, their movements creating a bone-chilling crunch with every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed an MRE from the coffee table, washing it down with water as he ate hungrily. The food triggered his salivary glands, helping restore his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After carefully finishing every last bite, he walked to the window, his face grim as he watched the zombies mindlessly wandering the streets below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the aftermath of the initial chaos, it seemed the mutant beasts and zombies had carved out their own territories. The zombies claimed the city while the mutant creatures retreated to the suburbs and forested areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had chosen this hotel carefully. It offered a perfect view of Sakra Tower across the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tower served as the Sakra Society's headquarters, and Alexander was certain people were still hiding inside. Despite his heightened sensory abilities, the thick concrete walls completely blocked his perception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't wanted to resort to this stakeout but was out of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he'd stormed the building earlier, he'd only found low-ranking Sakra Society members. There was not a single executive in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all networks down, he couldn't even reach Norma. The Dragon Gang might have known where Yinson was hiding, but that lead was cold now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took stock of his supplies&mdash;one box of MRE, a case of juice, and half a box of packaged bread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing he was missing was cigarettes. He'd run out, which meant he'd need to make a supply run soon.</span></p></div>
