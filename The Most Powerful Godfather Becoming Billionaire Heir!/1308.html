        <h1>Chapter 1308 Success</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! There's a melon here that's still intact. It was hidden under the leaves, so they didn't see it. And look! Here's another one... Two in total!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see." Alexander crouched down to inspect them. "Looks like they were in a hurry and didn't check properly. They must have been afraid we'd catch them in the act. Two melons are better than nothing. We'll plant these. At least we have something to work with. Tonight, we'll build a shelter here and take turns keeping watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan stayed behind to guard the field while Alexander went to the manor to fetch their dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mealtime, and as usual, the estate was bustling with people. But Alexander immediately noticed something strange. The familiar faces around him avoided his gaze. The moment they saw him, they looked away and quickly left, as if afraid of getting involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen slipped over to his side and whispered, "Alexander, be careful. I'll tell my grandfather about this." Then he hurried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of gratitude filled Alexander's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good brother, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply toward Jalen's retreating figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the heart of Emerald Manor stood a grand stone house, lavishly decorated inside. In the center of the room, a wooden table stood, where three men sat drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A toast to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland rose, holding his cup, and respectfully bowed to Donald before drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald glanced at him and said, "You should've done this sooner. Now those two little Risuneses can't do anything, can they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely right, Mr. Wachtell. I should have handled it better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland nodded repeatedly, eager to please.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wheeler, you were careless too," Rory chimed in, smoothing things over. "None of us expected them to master the Energy-Gathering Technique so quickly. Please don't be angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for the Aquatic-Terrestrial Gathering a few months ago, after which Mr. Webster went into seclusion, I would've personally gone to see him. How could the Great Sect allow&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald abruptly cut himself off, his expression tightening. He glanced at the other two, then fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland pretended not to hear the slip. Instead, he stood up, clapped Rory on the shoulder, and said, "Rory, you did well this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll make sure you're rewarded. If Mr. Wachtell is pleased, you might even get a Verdant Crown Melon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Verdant Crown Melon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory's face lit up with excitement. "I'll keep a close eye on them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Good! Come, let's drink!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than ten days passed. Alexander and Logan stayed in their makeshift shelter, guarding their precious melons day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at mealtime, one of them would fetch food while the other stayed behind. Aside from tending to the crops, they focused on training, practicing the Energy-Gathering Technique, and refining their Arhat Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's strikes became increasingly sharp and forceful. Logan also made significant progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory came by a few times, but whenever he saw the two of them glaring at him with murderous intensity, he didn't dare get too close. He would simply glance at the field from a distance and then scurry away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wheeler, those two Risuneses are watching their field day and night. I think we might've missed some melons last time. What should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory ran back to Cleveland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cleveland's eyes narrowed. He sneered and said, "So they still have melons? Tonight, we'll take care of that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the moon hung as a half-circle in the sky, casting faint patches of silver light on the ground. The estate was quiet, its inhabitants deep in sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two figures emerged from the manor, both dressed in black, their faces covered with dark scarves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taller one had large hands and feet. It was Cleveland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other held an iron spear. His name was Rory, Cleveland's ever-loyal lackey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two moved stealthily under the moonlight, making their way toward the eastern side of the estate, where the melon fields lay beneath the mountain's shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the shelter, Logan was fast asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was sweltering. Alexander had removed his rough tunic and was sitting cross-legged, shirtless, practicing the Energy-Gathering Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he completed a cycle, he felt his entire body brimming with energy. By now, he only needed three hours of sleep a night. His martial core's Force cluster had even begun to grow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing his training, he was about to step outside to practice Arhat Fist when he suddenly heard faint footsteps approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since stepping into Level-One Warrior, his senses had sharpened considerably. He could now distinguish sounds carried by the wind and detect even the slightest movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peering out, he spotted two shadowy figures creeping toward the field. One of them was carrying an iron spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logan, wake up! Wake up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kicked Logan a few times, then rushed out himself. He charged straight at the two figures. "Who's there?!" he bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rory flinched. During the day, when he had observed Alexander from afar, he hadn't thought much of him. But now, up close, he realized something was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's sharp eyebrows were drawn together in fury. His eyes blazed like falling stars. His muscles, tense and sculpted, rose like mountains beneath his skin. His presence radiated sheer, unshakable power.</span></p></div>
