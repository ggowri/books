        <h1>Chapter 89 Unconvinced</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava scoffed, crossing her arms defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he's my boyfriend, then we rise and fall together. It's all or nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next moment, a heavy sigh escaped her lips. "I just don't get what the new chairman is up to. Without his orders, I can't rally the entire group to stand against Sebastian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've tried reaching out to Anne twice, but I haven't even laid eyes on that damn chairman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even the Godfather hasn't made a peep. It's clear he's turning a blind eye to Sebastian, and there are whispers that he wants the Brilliant Group to swallow us whole."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's brows knitted together, a deep sense of helplessness washing over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The true power and resources of the Saint Group lay in the hands of the chairman and the Godfather. Although she was the president, her role was more about management than wielding real influence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca, her friend, spoke up with a serious tone, "Ava, the spark that ignited this mess was Alexander ruining Theodore's hands. The only way forward for you now is to let go of Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shook her head without hesitation. "Not a chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca replied, exasperated, "Ava, you really are hopelessly devoted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look, I may not be a fan of Alexander, but I won't interfere with your choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, if things spiral out of control, I can't promise anything for Alexander, but I will do everything in my power to keep you safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava chuckled softly, locking eyes with her best friend. "Rebecca, we're sisters at heart. You promise me this. If it ever comes down to it, don't worry about me&mdash;just save Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was at a loss for words, wishing she could just take Alexander out of the equation entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to argue further, hurried footsteps echoed down the hallway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door burst open, and a breathless voice shouted, "Ms. Blackburn! Sebastian just rolled in with a whole crew!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's expression hardened instantly. She quickly dialed Max, instructing him to gather everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Ava, accompanied by Max and a dozen subordinates, made her way to confront Sebastian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they approached, they saw him being helped out of a car, looking like a ghost of his former self, which left everyone stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for Ava to speak, Sebastian shouted, desperation etched across his face, "Ms. Blackburn, I'm here to beg for your help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, talk to Alexander for me. Don't let him curse me with magic. The doctors say I've got only forty-eight hours left to live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way over, Sebastian had wrestled with his pride, ultimately deciding that survival was worth sacrificing his dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava and the Saint Group members exchanged bewildered glances, particularly Rebecca, whose jaw dropped in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Mr. Sebastian Tate, you're here looking for Alexander? Sorry, but he's not with me, and I can't get involved in this," Ava said, a proud smile creeping onto her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a swell of pride for Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian pleaded, desperation dripping from his words, "Ms. Blackburn, you two are supposed to be a couple, right? If you could just put in a good word for me, I'm sure Alexander would cut me some slack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, we're all under the Godfather's umbrella. Just think of it as a favor..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's public display of humility stripped away any remnants of his dignity as the Brilliant Group president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but smile wider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Sebastian Tate, while I may be Alexander's girlfriend, this is something I can't help with. It's entirely up to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You! You're all unbelievable..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian trembled with rage, but he knew better than to escalate things. With gritted teeth, he turned and stormed off, frustration boiling within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Sebastian slink away in defeat, Ava felt a wave of relief wash over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, did you see that? Alexander is even more formidable than I imagined. Sebastian was utterly defeated before the real battle even began."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca pouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if he knows a bit of witchcraft, it's hardly impressive. Are you really considering marrying a man who brings nothing but disaster and fear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava huffed in response, "Rebecca, that's just prejudice. And besides, I've never seen you so invested in a man before. Are you secretly interested in Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a lighthearted mood, Ava jokingly threw her arms around Rebecca and began tickling her under the arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop! Haha... ticklish... you're the one with a crush on Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca giggled, swatting at Ava before the two began a spirited bout of playful wrestling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two elegant women, engaged in their carefree antics, left everyone around them utterly mesmerized by their charming display.</p></div>
