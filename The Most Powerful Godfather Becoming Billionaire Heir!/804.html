        <h1>Chapter 804 Don't Dare to Act Recklessly</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To upgrade the energy core of a level-two lightsaber to level three, besides top-grade gems, 12 types of rare metals were required.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander had almost collected 11 of them, but he was still short of the last metal, Iridium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Iridium was the most expensive metal in the world, costing over one million dollars per pound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander could afford it, but unfortunately, it was difficult to mine globally, so its production was limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The global annual production was only a few thousand pounds, but Alexander needed a full thousand pounds of Iridium to upgrade the Lightsaber core to Level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Alexander's current terrifying wealth and manpower, he was still short of several hundred pounds of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dragon Gang operated the world's largest metal recycling business, and it was estimated that they had a significant stockpile of Iridium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking that the Dragon Gang controlled the Devil Island he needed, as well as Iridium, Alexander became excited and wanted to visit the Dragon Gang's headquarters at Risun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander issued a command, "Marvin, notify everyone that I want to hold a meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Treasure Island had become a bustling island city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some time had passed since the great battle between Red Umbrella Group and Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bloodstains and corpses had long been cleaned up, and the damaged buildings had been repaired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the regulations set by Alexander, Treasure Island had become orderly and prosperous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bustling commercial streets were filled with various shops selling clothes, shoes, hats, jewelry, and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were also restaurants, hotels, cinemas, and supermarkets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of bars had doubled, and bursts of laughter and cheer could be heard from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the square near Brilliant Group Building, the most upscale dining and hotels on Treasure Island were concentrated, along with various luxury stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's great. Today, my sales reached one million dollars, and I earned a bonus of 40 thousand dollars." a beautiful female shop assistant in a luxury store beamed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, you're really lucky today. That customer is so rich. He bought Herm&egrave;s without batting an eye. The people on this island are wealthy," another hot female shop assistant said enviously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heh, I told you to come here to make money, but you didn't want to. Now, you know I didn't lie to you, right? You can really make money here. It's not called Treasure Island for nothing," the beautiful shop assistant boasted about her foresight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How was I supposed to know it would be like this? Before, people said Treasure Island was full of criminals who killed, raped, and robbed," the slender shop assistant said with embarrassment. "I didn't dare to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beautiful shop assistant rolled her eyes. "Don't listen to those people's nonsense. Many people on Treasure Island indeed make money in shady ways, but there are rules here. As long as Brilliant Group keeps them in check, they won't dare to act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember the robber from the day before yesterday? He was shot dead on the street by the patrol team. Who would dare to rob now? So, this place is our paradise for making money," the beautiful shop assistant said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned in closer and added, "Katy, I heard that a very rich man is pursuing you, right? He even bought you flowers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, he seems pretty good, just a bit older than me. He's in the arms business. He said he's made enough money and wanted to settle down on Treasure Island." Katy blushed, slightly swaying her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm so jealous of you. What's there to be shy about? Marrying a man ten years older is fine. As long as he's mature and stable and has money, that's the most important thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Being with a man like that, you'll be set for life," the beautiful shop said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She patted Katy on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, let's work hard together and make a name for ourselves on Treasure Island." Katy felt a surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wall clock chimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Katy glanced at the time, and a sweet smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "There's still half an hour left. He'll come to pick me up to go shopping. Could you take care of the store for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beautiful scenes like this were common on Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The island was peaceful and safe, with a cool sea breeze blowing. People were filled with hope for a bright future.</span></p></div>
