        <h1>Chapter 492 I Don't Respond to Threats</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quietly slipped out of Lynn's bedroom, glancing at the clock. It was already past eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard Ava come home the previous night, right in the midst of his and Lynn's intense second round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's moans had practically filled the entire house. Ava had certainly heard them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering the kitchen, Alexander saw Ava standing with her back to him, busy preparing breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, my wife's making me breakfast. Just what I need&mdash;I'm actually pretty hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava wore a seductive, silky nightgown, her long, fair legs exposed, with the gown barely covering her hips, though her figure was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a sudden rush of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Lynn spent a wonderful night and absorbed a lot of the Force left by James. He was in a good mood and wanted to make further progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crept up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava let out a soft yelp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why sneaking up like that&mdash;you scared me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a deep breath, inhaling her scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smells wonderful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm cooking spaghetti; of course, it smells good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I meant you smell wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, quit it! I'm cooking..." she protested, blushing and trying to bat his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's hands slid beneath her gown. Ava had clearly just woken up and hadn't bothered with a bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop that! Didn't get enough last night? You're insatiable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensed a trace of jealousy in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly, it's not the same when you're not there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched, Ava reached up to wrap her arms around his neck, returning his kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit it; I'm making breakfast. Aren't we heading back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> today? Ashley and Charlize both need us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nuzzled her ear with a grin. "We're leaving tomorrow. Tonight, how about you both keep me company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...you are so perverted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed deeply, wishing she could disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, footsteps echoed down the stairs, and Lynn came down, her cheeks still flushed from the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aha, my girl's back..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn's face glowed with a shy </span><span>smile,</span><span> her head lowered like a bashful schoolgirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, breakfast is almost ready," Ava replied, grinning as she noticed how much better her mother looked compared to just a day ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lynn suddenly hugged her tightly, her eyes misty. "Thank you, Ava, for my birthday gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava rested her cheek on her mother's shoulder, her face radiating joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held each other in silence, both savoring the moment without the need for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander's phone rang, its shrill tone interrupting the tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the screen&mdash;it was an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a sense of foreboding, he hesitated but answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander? This is Rock Rossetti, Elder of the City of Sorcery," an old, raspy voice said on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised an eyebrow, smirking slightly. "Well, Mr. Rossetti, what do you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, Rock's voice hardened. "Alexander, I'm calling on behalf of the City of Sorcery. I want you to return the Ancestral Witch's Cane and the Spirit Bead Bracelet. They rightfully belong to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you surrender them willingly, I'll overlook your prior offenses&mdash;killing Guzman, Drake, and injuring Leonard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smirk grew wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when is Leonard one of your people? I thought he was just a diviner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Will you return them, or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rock's impatience was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think defying the City of Sorcery will end well? Besides, the Ancestral Witch's Cane and Spirit Bead Bracelet are useless in your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "I don't respond to threats. Once something's in my hands, no one's taking it back that easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Others may fear your City of Sorcery, but I don't. If you were truly as powerful as you say, would I even be standing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Rock spluttered, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, he began to chuckle darkly, "Alexander, don't get cocky. You've won a few battles and think you're untouchable. Here's a suggestion: go home and check on your daughter."</span></p></div>
