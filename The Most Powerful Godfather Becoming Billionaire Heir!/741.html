        <h1>Chapter 741 He Is a Madman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is quite good at pretending, and I think he is at his wits' end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander invented the magic powder at such a young age, and why would he want to destroy his reputation and future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These experts were discussing the matter, but no one was optimistic about Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save me! Mr. Hawthorne, please save me... I am willing to pay 50 million dollars... No, 100 million dollars. I will pay 100 million dollars. Please save me..." Archer stammered and begged, and he was about to suffocate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly screamed, rolled his eyes, curled up into a ball, and twitched continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Save him quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Melin couldn't bear it anymore, and Eddy rushed over to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch him!" Alexander suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful voice exploded in everyone's ears like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone covered their ears and took a few steps back in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area around the bed was cleared in an instant. Everyone stayed away and stared at Alexander in shock, not knowing what was wrong with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used the Force to increase the frequency of sound vibration, which was also a technique inherited from the Ultimate Legacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this kind of sonic attack could only be used by one with the strength of a peak of the Intermediate Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, Alexander's Force had improved a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now is the best time to treat Mr. Crawford. Please don't interfere with me. If I can't cure him, you will cause trouble to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was full of confidence, and his tone was filled with invisible majesty, which stunned everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Crawford, you said it yourself and give me 100 million dollars. Life is the most precious thing. I can save your life, so 100 million dollars is not expensive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started the treatment while talking to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened Archer's mouth, stuffed in a small piece of antidote, and then used the Force to heal him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experts watched Alexander's actions intently, all showing contemptuous expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how he treats the plague? It's crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew this guy was a liar. Hurry up and get him arrested. This is ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine sneered, "Will he cure Mr. Crawford? Stop kidding, and people from Loscity are rubbish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Alexander shouted and asked everyone to be quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense are you talking about? Isn't Mr. Crawford out of danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was startled and looked at Archer lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he kept his eyes closed and did not move, showing no sign of being out of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madman! Is this guy a madman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is really good at pretending, but we are not blind. What's so good about Mr. Crawford?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is full of nonsense, Mr. Blunt. If you don't severely punish this liar, the reputation of Loscity will be completely ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Experts attacked Alexander with language one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gideon and Melin began to lose confidence, and Anderson's face turned gloomy. He was ready to order the arrest of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of idiots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's mocking voice was clearly heard by everyone and aroused the common hatred of all experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Blunt, arrest this liar!" Elaine said loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anderson was stunned, staring at the bed stupidly as if he had seen something unbelievable, his expression full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine and the others turned their heads curiously, and suddenly, everyone's expression changed, as if their bodies were frozen in place, their bodies stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer, who was on the verge of death just now, actually sat up by himself at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide open, and his face was confused, as if he hadn't figured out the situation yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I dead? Where is this? The hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer stared and looked around in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, his dull eyes became bright, and his expression was full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Loscity Hospital? Am I not dead? Am I not dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer seemed to have had a nightmare. After coming to his senses, he actually wanted to get out of the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held onto the edge of the bed and slowly moved his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid everyone's shocked gaze, Archer successfully stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his legs were still shaking and his body was trembling, Archer, who was on the verge of death, actually stood up!</span></p></div>
