        <h1>Chapter 580 Half-brother</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt like she was about to fly; having an extra pair of hands really doubled the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the deep sense of shame, Nancy had already fallen into addiction and collapse before Alexander officially started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, I.</span><span>..I</span><span> can't stand it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia chuckled and quietly took out her own electronic toy. After turning it on, it started to vibrate and spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this thing is smaller than Alexander's, it can vibrate and rotate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, no! What are you doing? Stop her, don't let her do this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy wanted to grab Rosalia's hand, but she couldn't stop it at all. Instead, she watched the electric toy sink into her body little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's whole body was twitching and her buttocks were a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia had more fun. She pressed on Nancy, pressed her breasts against Nancy's, and rubbed and rotated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy rolled her eyes and almost fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was also excited when he saw the honorable leader of The Kaylon was so excited. While Nancy opened her cherry mouth, it rushed in directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cool!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sucked it with a very greedy attitude, and it was indeed different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander was enjoying Nancy's service, he put his hands on Rosalia's body, kneading and playing with her, and he immediately felt a sense of conquest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the attack of Alexander and Rosalia, Nancy felt her soul flying, completely immersed in pleasure...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day at noon, Alexander asked Rosalia to take care of Ashley while he prepared to go to Nancy's house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headquarters of the Kaylon is located in the eastern suburbs of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, with a large lakeside villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knows that the Kaylon has a history of hundreds of years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the Restoration of Dynasty Movement, the Kaylon even controlled the underground forces in the entire north and was at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this history is too long to be verified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now the Kaylon is also one of the top forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a pity that the leader of the Kaylon had been a single heir for several generations, and by Nancy's generation, there was only one girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever marries Nancy will be able to obtain the Kaylon, which is like marrying a mountain of gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Nancy is so beautiful that any normal man would have some dirty thoughts about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander had no intention of marrying Nancy. With Ava in his heart, he would not choose any other woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for who he will marry in the end, Alexander just lets it be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a blue sports car roared past and overtook Nancy's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we go again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a ruthlessness in Nancy's beautiful eyes, and she stepped on the accelerator to the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the opponent's Ferrari accelerated first and soon disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Nancy was very unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who overtook? Do you know him?" Alexander asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is my half-sister, Sophie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy had a stern face and they even competed with each other while driving. It was </span><span>obvious that their relationship was not good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander heard the name, he became interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that famous internet celebrity Sophie who is good at dancing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's her. Are you interested in her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sneered. "It seems that you men are all the same. You can't control yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shrugged. "I'm just curious, just asking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't believe it and said sternly, "You can like anyone, but you can't like her. And you have to remember that the role you're playing is my boyfriend! If you get caught, I won't let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his chest and said, "Don't worry, I'm not as lustful as you think. I will definitely do what I promised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, don't mess around, be careful not to be seen through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy warned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was talking to himself while admiring the scenery outside the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Sophie has become a big internet celebrity in no time. In addition to her outstanding personal qualities, your father must have paid to support her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, don't like her, or I'll be angry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was still very worried, but she had to admit that Sophie was very beautiful. She had a good figure, was good at skirting around, and was very good at dancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the car had arrived at the entrance of the villa.</span></p></div>
