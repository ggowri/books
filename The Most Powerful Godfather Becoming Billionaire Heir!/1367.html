        <h1>Chapter 1367 Ten Moves Passed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes' face darkened as an invisible sword aura surged around him. His feet remained firmly planted on the stage as his hands, sharp like an eagle's claws, locked onto Alexander's arms with lightning speed. With a sharp twist, a pull, and a sudden fling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was hurled into the air. Rhodes lightly tapped his toes on the ground and leaped after him, executing a mid-air spin. A deafening crack of thunder echoed as his right leg lashed out like a whip, striking Alexander's waist and slamming him down onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rhodes landed, he gazed at Alexander's battered and twisted form and said softly, "It's over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the reviewing platform, Isolde shot to her feet, her face drained of color as she stared at the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's mouth hung open, his eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta's eyes burned with fury.&nbsp;"Mr. Hawthorne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an unexpected turn of events unfolded on the stage. A figure, bruised and bent at the waist in an unnatural way, shot toward Rhodes like a streaking comet, straight for his groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught completely off guard, Rhodes barely managed to twist his body. A sharp, numbing pain exploded in his thigh as he staggered back a step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire crowd was stunned. A&nbsp;level-four warrior, at the peak of his mastery, nearly stepping into level five, had just been pushed back by a&nbsp;level-three warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only sound remaining in the training arena was the crackling of torches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhodes let out a furious roar, his mind consumed by humiliation. To be forced back by a mere level-three warrior, and in front of everyone. It was unforgivable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious shout, a blinding silver crescent of sword energy erupted from him, colder than ice and sharp as a blade. Alexander's body was instantly riddled with cuts, blood gushing from countless wounds as he swayed unsteadily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another brilliant silver moon shot forward like lightning, slamming directly into Alexander's chest. With a thunderous&nbsp;boom, his bloodied and broken figure was sent soaring high over the edge of the stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten moves had passed. Alexander had been knocked out of the ring. Rhodes Monroe had won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the result seemed certain, a thunderous voice rang out in mid-air. A streak of green energy shot toward one of the arena pillars. The airborne figure spun in a graceful arc and landed on the other side of the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the stage, on the reviewing platform, and across the sea of spectators was utter silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some still had joy frozen on their faces; others stomped in frustration. Tears clung to Isolde's pale cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan's jaw dropped. Vegeta stood in shock. Sellers was heartbroken, his eyes wet with tears. Hogan's gaze burned with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"&nbsp;Rhodes' rage flared as he moved to charge forward, but suddenly, an unbearable chill crept over him. His entire body froze, as if plunged into an icy abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shifted stiffly toward the reviewing platform, where Huxley stood. It felt as though one more movement would seal his fate, that he would never live to see another sunrise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... that's impossible. This must be an illusion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander staggered to his feet, his body barely holding together. He knew his spine had shattered. If not for the miraculous power of his&nbsp;golden energy, he would have died a hundred times over by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Rhodes, whose face had turned ashen, and said coldly,&nbsp;"I'll gladly accept the gold coins and the manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without another word, he stepped down from the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"&nbsp;Rhodes' face turned red with rage, his fists clenched so tightly they trembled, but he didn't dare move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words&nbsp;"I'll gladly accept the gold coins and the manor"&nbsp;kept echoing in his mind, over and over, like a relentless drumbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below the stage, the crowd erupted into chaos. Cries and shouts rang out from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhodes, you bastard! What kind of level-four warrior is this joke?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a fraud! Rhodes, give me back my money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was a scam! Pay us back, Rhodes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the uproar, Julius was livid, his fury boiling over.&nbsp;"Rhodes, how dare you! Where's my damn money?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the stage, Rhodes' chest heaved with suppressed fury. His face suddenly turned pale, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Revenue officials in the crowd were grinning from ear to ear. This was a massive payday. The extra money for bonuses! Anyone who dared speak ill of Alexander, a true young hero? They'd make sure to deal with them personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan, Vegeta, Nova, and the three Valdez brothers surrounded Alexander, throwing their arms around him and laughing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We hit the jackpot! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the reviewing platform, Declan and Huxley exchanged glances before bursting into laughter and casually walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fermin chuckled and clasped his hands toward Fay.&nbsp;"Mr. Joel, impressive calculations! I must say, I'm in awe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fay's face was flushed, his voice slightly shaky.&nbsp;"Pure coincidence... But Alexander truly is a hero."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, he was already crunching numbers. He had likely made over hundreds of millions of coins from this!&nbsp;"Alexander, my lucky star!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde's tear-streaked face was a mix of joy and worry. She was thrilled that the scoundrel had won, but she couldn't stop worrying about how badly he was hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Lana and asked,&nbsp;"Lana, how much did you bet?"</span></p></div>
