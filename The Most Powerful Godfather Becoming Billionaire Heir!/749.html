        <h1>Chapter 749 The First Generation of Immortals</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only the Sakra Society, but also Felix's Red Umbrella Group, Brandon's Mafia, and even the City of Sorcery, along with the heads of state of various countries and countless wealthy individuals, all desire immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, let me show you our latest achievements!" Elaine waved her hand with great confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jake, along with several men in black, slowly pushed in a large and sturdy iron cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The iron cage was taller than a person, covered with a black canvas, making it impossible to see what was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson couldn't help but frown. "What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine, with a triumphant air, pulled back the canvas to reveal a terrifying humanoid monster inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the monster still maintained the basic shape of a human, its head was hanging down, with two pitch-black eye sockets, and its eyeballs had already rotted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The face was extremely withered and rotten, to the point that maggots could be seen burrowing in and out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of its teeth had fallen out, and its body was tattered and in rags, emitting a putrid stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a corpse, it was somehow still standing there, making for an extremely eerie living dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living dead turned towards Yinson, baring a terrifyingly wide mouth filled with sharp, beast-like fangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The living dead suddenly roared like a beast, its withered and blackened fingers clawing wildly at the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson was startled, his face turning ashen as he asked, "Is this the result of your research, turning a living person into a zombie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine lowered her head, unabashedly revealing a deep cleavage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, after fusing poison with the power elixir, I can bring the dead back to life. Although this living dead has no mind of its own and is left only with a bloodthirsty instinct, if you give me another six months, at most, I will be able to perfectly integrate the two and eliminate all side effects. By then, I will be able to grant immortality to the living and bestow them with great strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson became excited and loudly praised, "Very good! The plan for immortality must be completed within half a year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will, Mr. White!" Elaine clenched her fists confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White, this time I have created eight first-generation Immortals. They have no sense of pain, no fear, and are fearless in the face of death; they are the best warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson became even happier and immediately looked at Jake, "Doesn't Brandon have an ace assassin in Loscity? Take a few of the Immortals to Loscity and make sure to kill Alexander. This is your chance to make up for your mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I will go there immediately." Jake didn't dare to say anything more, and quickly lowered his head and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine stayed, shaking her hips as she walked toward Yinson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here and lick me, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson spread his legs and said with a lewd smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elaine knelt before Yinson with a flirtatious laugh, unzipped his pants, and began to work on his small penis diligently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she despised such a small-sized penis, she did not dare to show any disrespect in front of him. Instead, she kissed and sucked it, doing her best to serve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson, getting excited, reached out and grabbed Elaine's full breasts, kneading them forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, heavy breathing could be heard in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cabin where Bruno was, the clanging sounds of iron hammering had stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clanging sound of forging in Bruno's cabin had ceased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charcoal in the stove had also burned out, leaving only a pile of ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the final moment; if it succeeds, it will definitely be a sharp sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bruno was confident, he still felt uneasy. After all, it was his first time using tungsten steel to repair a broken sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not repaired properly, the blade would become very brittle and would shatter immediately upon being cooled in water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then bit his finger and squeezed drops of blood into a bucket of clear spring water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the spring water in the bucket was tinged with blood, Bruno plunged the glowing red sword into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high temperature of the sword immediately caused the spring water in the bucket to boil, producing dense steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade now had streaks of blood-red throughout, giving the once ordinary cleaver a very mysterious appearance.</span></p></div>
