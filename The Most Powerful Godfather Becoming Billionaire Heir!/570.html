        <h1>Chapter 570 Targeted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce wave of killing intent burst out, creating an intense, terrifying atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? This is the Kaylon entertainment center, backed by The Kaylon. It's not a place where you can push people around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you're breaking the rules. Are you looking to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Jaylon was trembling with fear, he stood firm with The Kaylon backing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful dealer looked at Diego. "Mr. Morris, you're accusing Jaylon of cheating. Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evidence? My word is the evidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an angry shout, Diego slammed his hand down on the gambling table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire table collapsed, and all the chips scattered onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a cloud of black smoke rose from Diego's hand. The pungent smell immediately made everyone feel dizzy and weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poisoned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a terrifying poisonous strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Felix's vision darkened as he staggered back two steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he weren't a level-two metahuman with some resistance to poison, he'd be as helpless as the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the VIP room's doors were kicked open with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy doors slammed into the wall, shaking the entire VIP room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of men in black suits rushed in, surrounding Barry's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole led the group personally, with a dozen hardened fighters behind him, exuding a ruthless, battle-worn aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them were several armed guards, aiming their weapons at Barry and his group, ready to shoot at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was deafening; the chilling aura of bloodlust hung over the room like a heavy mountain, suffocating everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole snorted coldly and said bluntly, "Anyone looking to make trouble here at the Kaylon entertainment center won't live to see the sun tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's face darkened. The Kaylon not only had numbers on their side but also powerful fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His poison strike was powerful, but in a brawl, especially in such a small space, things wouldn't end well for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sides faced off for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Barry raised his hand. "Diego, let it go! My apologies. My steward has a bit of a temper. We'll cover the cost of the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A temper, huh? Having a temper lets you break the table? That table costs two hundred thousand dollars. Pay up!" Cole shouted, showing no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What! This cheap table costs two hundred thousand dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry nearly exploded in anger, realizing this was blatant extortion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego, however, remained silent, aware that his own outburst had caused this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Kaylon's turf, and if a fight broke out, they wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cole chuckled and said, "My table's just that expensive. Now the price has gone up&mdash;to three hundred thousand. If you don't pay, you're not leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was furious, practically seeing red, but the situation didn't look good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego took a deep breath, holding back his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, three hundred thousand. I'll pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diego handed over the money, Barry tried to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Cole blocked them, his face filled with a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fair's fair. This woman belongs to Finley now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's chest heaved as he tried to control his rage, his face red all the way to his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't give up Joyce, they wouldn't be leaving here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce stood alone, her expression blank, as she slowly walked toward Finley and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley and Jaylon's eyes gleamed with a predatory look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Joyce's graceful, sensual figure, their eyes hungry, though they didn't dare make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this woman was wanted by higher-ups!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the lustful expressions on Finley and Jaylon's faces, Barry clenched his fists tightly, his eyes practically shooting fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce was officially his secretary but, in reality, his mistress. Now, she was about to be taken by other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said to Barry with a mocking smile, feeling quite pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was delighted to see Barry losing even his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Barry and Diego were intact, Felix still needed them to take on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Felix had no idea that both he and Barry had already become targets of Alexander.</span></p></div>
