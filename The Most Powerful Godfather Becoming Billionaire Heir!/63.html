        <h1>Chapter 63 The Magic Powder</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander enjoyed the touch of Ava's plump and soft body and blushed at the sight of her charming and watery eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but giggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been pursued by countless men, but she rarely met innocent men who got shy and blushed like Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava asked Rebecca to wait for her at the house and went to visit Lily with Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca watched the two of them leave hand in hand and couldn't help but frown deeply, thinking Alexander was good at capturing a woman's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could there be such innocent and lovely men in the world?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca thought Alexander must have faked it. She didn't want Ava to be deceived. Ava deserved a better man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lily, how are you doing today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander pushed open the door to the ward and entered with Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was holding a lot of fruits and a bouquet of flowers and placed them on the bedside table with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lily saw Ava, she smiled broadly at the beautiful and polite girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them chatted happily for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Alexander was leaving, Lily reminded him, "Alexander, you must cherish Ava. She is much better than Jane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava instantly blushed in embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander held her hand, his heart pounding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. I won't let you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they got into the car, Ava said with a serious expression, "I made a bet with Oscar that we would drive the forces of the Brilliant Group and the Cripples out of Loscity within a month. We must take action first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Last time you killed Nicholas and Daniel, and now Betty is the last one left in the management of the Loscity branch of Brilliant Group. Why don't you deal with her as well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When they are leaderless, we will take the opportunity to launch a cleanup operation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander secretly admired Ava, who deserved to be the president of the Saint Group. Although she was a woman, she was decisive and ruthless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He did not tell Ava that Betty was his undercover agent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pondering for a while, Alexander smiled mysteriously and said, "I heard that there is a new product called magic powder on the market. It can replace drugs without any harm to the health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The vast majority of the profits of the Brilliant Group come from the drug trade. When the magic powder replaces the drugs, the Brilliant Group will cease to exist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was confused. She had never heard of any magic powder before. How did Alexander know about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked doubtfully, "What is magic powder? Is it a new type of drug? The Saint Group never deals with drugs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's not a drug. Instead, it's good for health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander shook his head vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. Wait for a few days. Soon the magic powder will spread in the market."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Alexander's confident face, Ava started to believe him even though she found it unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then we'll wait for a few more days, but we can't afford to wait for too long. Two of the three executives of the Brilliant Group in Loscity died, and Guzman will send someone to here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have to be careful recently. You broke Joseph's hand, and the Cripples will get back at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Ava reminded Alexander, she snuggled into his arms, feeling extremely warm and safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will be careful and won't let anyone hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander caressed Ava tenderly with affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava looked at Alexander shyly, her charming eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her beauty enchanted Alexander. Before he knew what was happening, Ava kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their lips met, and their tongues intertwined. The faint fragrance attacked Alexander's nose, and the plump and beautiful body pressed tightly against him, boiling his blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he recalled what had happened between the two of them, and the scenes flashed across his mind like a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was stunned by her beauty when they first met. Ava stood up for him when he signed the divorce agreement. When no one thought highly of him, Ava didn't stop supporting and trusting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's heart was pounding, and he could no longer control his love and desire. He couldn't help but let out a beast-like growl from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kissed Ava back fiercely, his hands wandering over her smooth breasts and buttocks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Alexander touched Ava, he used his Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he rescued Betty last time, he accidentally discovered that the Force could bring women extreme happiness, making them addicted.</p></div>
