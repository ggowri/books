        <h1>Chapter 119 A Helpless Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian let out a mocking laugh. He raised his voice and announced, "From now on, only those willing to ally with the Brilliant Group in opposing the Saint Group will have the right to distribute magic powder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares defy my orders will get nothing from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into a wave of anxious murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though members of The Blood Gang, The Cripples, and several powerful families felt anger rise, none dared openly offend Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Oscar stood quietly, unwilling to speak out. Sebastian's influence was far too strong now, and no one wanted to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oscar, watching from the sidelines, felt a pang of disappointment in Alexander. He couldn't believe Alexander had misled him about securing the distribution rights for magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone stepped forward to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander used sorcery to hurt Mr. Tate. He should pay for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Alexander is nothing but trouble and needs to be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't have someone like him in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, dozens of families and organizations stood behind Sebastian, angrily condemning Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Saint Group members began to feel immense pressure. Their faces turned pale as they started to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Saint Group had financial clout, they'd never ventured into the underworld. Faced with so many enemies, they were outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max pleaded anxiously, "Ms. Blackburn, there are too many of them. This isn't the time to fight. Maybe we should leave Alexander behind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ava spread her arms, standing protectively in front of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone tries to harm Alexander, the Saint Group will make them regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the Federer family stepped forward and spoke coldly. "Apologies, Ms. Blackburn. For the sake of magic powder, the Federer family is choosing to side with </span><span>the Brilliant Group. Our alliance with the Saint Group ends here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Houtte</span><span> of The Cripples took a deep drag from his cigar, exhaling a thick ring of smoke with a wry smile. "Ms. Blackburn, I'm sorry, but I won't be able to provide security for the Saint Group any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary of The Blood Gang let out a playful laugh. "Ms. Blackburn, while I admire your devotion to Alexander, business comes first. Consider our plans together officially canceled. Good luck to you both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, family after family and organization after organization publicly severed their ties with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Saint Group's allies in </span><span>Loscity</span><span> had all turned their backs in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loscity</span><span> was the Saint Group's headquarters. Losing this foundation would leave the Saint Group exposed and vulnerable to the Brilliant Group's attacks, leading to its inevitable collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was eager to secure distribution rights for magic powder, so they had no choice but to cut ties with the Saint Group completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face went pale. She had never felt this helpless before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, she pulled out her phone and dialed the number for the mysterious chairman. She was convinced he was the only one who could save them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long dial tone echoed in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call finally ended with no answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fury, Ava hurled her phone to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Some 'mysterious chairman' he is. He won't lift a finger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but give a wry smile, hearing her curse him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Ava close, speaking with a quiet resolve. "I can handle my own problems. I meant what I said. The Saint Group will become the exclusive distributor for magic powder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this made Ava angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how can you still be talking like this? Things are bad enough already, so stop making me even more furious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What a joke. Still making empty boasts, even on the brink of death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just stalling, acting all crazy to buy time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in laughter, sneering and taunting Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion watched him with a pitying look as though he were gazing at a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Brilliant Group already has the exclusive rights. You've lost. Just admit defeat gracefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava gave Alexander a hard shove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave now. Take the money and go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going anywhere!" Sebastian sneered. "Alexander, I'd suggest you lift the curse from my son. If you do that, I might consider letting you die a little more peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's men surrounded Alexander, forming an impenetrable circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He himself stood far back, fearful that Alexander might cast a spell on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Blackburn," one of the men said with a smug grin, "you'd be smart to give up on </span><span>this man. If you surrender now, you can avoid unnecessary suffering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glint of lust in his eye, the man reached forward, his hand lunging toward Ava's chest.</span></p></div>
