        <h1>Chapter 673 Secret Room</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that guy dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton asked expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the smoke cleared, Alexander appeared and walked towards them calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's face changed drastically. "Is this guy a monster? He hasn't been killed yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream was heard. And the head of the shooter operating the heavy machine gun exploded. Blood spilled on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was a second scream. And another machine gunner was shot in the head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was trembling with fear. They only saw Alexander waving his hands, but there was no gunfire. They didn't know how he did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly hid behind the SUV, howling in shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire now. Fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone wanted to replace the machine gunner, but before he could touch the gun, his head exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, everyone saw that it was a small stone that pierced the gunman's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept waving his hands. And Beverly's men were shot in the head one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people screamed in fear and quickly hid behind sandbags.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was chaotic. No one cared to stop Alexander. They all followed suit and hid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly ran inside desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton hurriedly followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! My legs..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton, who had only run a few steps, let out a scream and collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a gaping hole in his right leg, bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton shouted desperately, but Beverly just turned her head and looked at him, then ran into the inner courtyard at a faster speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, stop. Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton wailed and could only watch Beverly run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unwilling to wait for death, so he crawled on the ground, leaving a long trail of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Paxton screamed again. Another stone pierced his left leg. He was disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The positions where the two stones hit were symmetrical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, the heavily guarded scene was reduced to a pile of corpses like hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton was terrified. He was crying and crawling on the ground with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was covered in blood and dirt. And it was hard to imagine that he was the head of the Mafia in </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Paxton was like the king of </span><span>Mandale</span><span> Town, but now he had become a useless person crawling on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were slight footsteps. Alexander walked up to Paxton elegantly, looking down at him, and said, "You regret it now, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please don't kill me! Please, don't kill me... I can do anything. I can serve you, really!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton begged Alexander. Now he only wanted to stay alive, and he was willing to give up his dignity and moral integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and responded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will be hard to be my servant. Forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying, Alexander waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stone flew out and hit Paxton's head hard. Blood flowed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would not let him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence in the Weaver House. And everyone had already run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered. He could let everyone else go, but not Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already locked onto Beverly with his All-seeing Eyes. She was cunning. She did not escape like the others but ran into a room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly pressed a hidden button in the corner of the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floor in the center of the room cracked, revealing a staircase leading underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly entered the secret passage, and the floor closed automatically. There was no visible flaw from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly cursed and looked relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This secret basement contained most of the Weaver family's wealth, as well as enough food and water for her to survive for a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was even a bedroom and a bathroom inside with all the necessary furniture and appliances.</span></p></div>
