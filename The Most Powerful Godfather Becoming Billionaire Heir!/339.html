        <h1>Chapter 339 Don't Come Over</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary turned around and ran away in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Leo, the most powerful man at Miranda Hotel, was no match for Alexander, Zachary had lost his fighting spirit and dared not to interfere in this matter anymore, nor was he in a position to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos trembled with fear. He never expected that Leo, known as the underground boxing king of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, would be knocked out in one move by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, realizing that they were at a disadvantage, took the pain and struggled to escape outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before taking a step, he felt a sharp pain in his right leg and was kicked down by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos took the opportunity to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't get away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Marcos by the wrist and threw him over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos fell heavily to the floor, in so much pain that he couldn't get up for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you very arrogant just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted Marcos and slapped him in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound echoed in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hate bastards who drug women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't your father a gangster boss? He's not even as formidable as Guzman. How dare you provoke me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scolded Marcos while slapping him hard in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my eyes, you are like an ant on the ground. I can crush you to death with one foot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being slapped more than a dozen times, Marcos was in a daze. His face was as swollen as a </span><span>pig's</span><span>, and the blood kept gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, kill me today if you have the guts. Otherwise, I will definitely take revenge. My dad will definitely eliminate you and your entire family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos was still tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, stop fighting. Let's leave </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn worried that someone might get killed and that Caleb would make things difficult for them, quickly dragged Alexander out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos grinned with a fierce expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, are you scared now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me if you dare. Otherwise, I will be your nightmare. I will return the humiliation I suffered today to you tenfold or a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn shook in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up! Let's get out of </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could afford to offend Owen but not Caleb, an influential drug lord in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't take Madelyn's advice. Instead, he picked up the wine glass, approached Marcos, and smiled, "I can kill you anytime, but I want you to live a hellish life and lose your reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his tone was calm, his cold and terrifying aura caused the atmosphere to be tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos immediately grew nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to do? Kill me if you have the guts. Don't play dirty tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad is Caleb Brooks. Your dirty tricks will only lead to your miserable doom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos' threat obviously proved that he was really afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Drink it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you, I won't drink it. Kill me if you can," Marcos roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held him by the head and forced him to take several large gulps of wine from his glass.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos subconsciously swallowed the wine that dissolved the drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander did the same thing to Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was dumbfounded. Dozens of aphrodisiacs were added to the glass, and it was potent.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcos and Owen didn't have sex with women, the consequences would be serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The empty wine glass smashed to the floor with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took Madelyn's hand and walked outside calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked worriedly, "A-Are they going to </span><span>be</span><span> okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was the cause. If Alexander got into trouble for saving her, she would feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed the door with his backhand and used the Force to destroy the key cylinder and lock the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcos gasped heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scratched his body crazily and roared like a wild animal, "I am hot and uncomfortable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen had only drunk a small portion of the wine, so his reaction was slower than Marcos'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcos. Marcos, what do you want to do? Don't come over. Don't come over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Marcos pressed him down eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcos, stimulated by the effects of the drugs, had gone mad. No matter how Owen resisted, it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drugs soon took effect on Owen. He was so excited that even his eyes turned bloodshot.</span></p></div>
