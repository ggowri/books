        <h1>Chapter 628 The Only Chance</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As blood spurted out, Francisco's head fell to the ground and rolled far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene shocked everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The king-level mercenary couldn't even block Bruno's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's cold expression didn't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were all frightened and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you run away?" Bruno chased after them mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every flash of the machete, a body fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people left couldn't resist at all and were killed one by one by Bruno, leaving corpses all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you have to offend Brandon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno glanced at the corpses on the ground, then limped away with the machete in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, it began to rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the raindrops became denser, covering the whole world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl was standing under a dilapidated wooden house. His whole body was soaked by the heavy rain, and he was shivering with cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it. Why hasn't that bastard come back yet? Could he have died in the Redoom Group? It would be better if he died. Otherwise, Godfather will let him return to the family." Karl said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he learned that Brandon wanted Bruno to return to the family and become an upper member of the Mafia, he was filled with rage but didn't know how to vent it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heavy rain, a black figure appeared and walked slowly towards Karl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong, murderous aura was approaching, no weaker than that of Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Bruno was back, Karl was surprised, and his body shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the first time he met Bruno. Every time he met him, he would convey Brandon's orders and ask Bruno to do some dirty work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every time he saw Bruno, he felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bruno's ugly face, hidden by the mask, and his terrifying black machete made Karl scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have all of them been killed?" Karl asked and pretended to be very calm, but his trembling voice betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno waved his hand expressionlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francisco's head rolled out of the handbag and rolled to Karl's feet, making him scream in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno glanced at him with contempt. Then he opened the shabby wooden door and </span><span>limped in with his lame leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wooden house was not big, with one bedroom and one living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the furniture was all made of wood and was very old, it was cleaned and tidy, and all the items were arranged in order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the table in the middle, there was a white urn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno walked forward and bowed to the urn respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his expression couldn't be seen, his eyes were gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl followed in. Seeing the urn, he felt a chill in his heart and was very uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno glanced at Karl with a cold gaze and said without any emotion, "Don't waste time. Who is the target next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl licked his dry lips, feeling like he was facing a beast that could kill him at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is the target next?" Bruno was unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl swallowed and tried to maintain a steady tone. "Bruno, great news. Godfather asked me to tell you that as long as you go to Loscity and kill Alexander, your mother can be buried in the family cemetery, and you will also be accepted by the family. You will become an upper member of the Mafia and one of the successors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your mother's last wish was to be buried in the family cemetery and to make you return to the Hawkins family. This is your only chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's eyes lit up as he tightened the machete in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said excitedly, "I don't want to return to the Hawkins family, nor do I want to be an upper member of Mafia. I don't admit that I am a member of the Hawkins family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want to bury my mother in the family cemetery, and no one can look down on her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl became excited and shouted angrily, "Bruno, </span><span>How</span><span> dare you! What nonsense are you talking about? Aren't you afraid that I will tell Godfather?"</span></p></div>
