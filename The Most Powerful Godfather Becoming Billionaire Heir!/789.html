        <h1>Chapter 789 Finally Made It</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall was soaked in blood, the bodies of fallen wizards sprawled across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sixty or seventy wizards lay lifeless, their blood pooling around them, while only a handful of Shadow's people bore injuries. The remaining wizards lowered their heads in silence, not daring to even breathe too loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The City of Sorcery hadn't crumbled completely, but it was left in ruins, its pride shattered. The diehard wizards who had refused to surrender were mercilessly slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander stood amidst the carnage, his face calm and emotionless. His piercing gaze swept over the bloodstained hall and the corpses scattered across it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To achieve greatness, one couldn't afford kindness toward enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander would never tolerate anyone using poison to harm others, especially when his daughter and loved ones were involved. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, the wizards who had fallen weren't innocent&mdash;they were criminals, murderers who had spilled blood without remorse. Their deaths were nothing more than retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne stood among the hundreds of wizards now kneeling in submission. Her heart raced with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By publicly entrusting the city to her, Alexander had effectively made her the lord of the City of Sorcery. He had no intention of managing it himself, leaving her in full control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen up!" Alexander's voice rang out, cold and commanding as he pointed to Yvonne. "From this moment on, Yvonne is your lord. Her words are my words. Anyone who dares defy her will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chorus of voices echoed in response:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We swear to obey her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, we will follow her orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We pledge our loyalty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wizards were desperate to live. For years, they had used their power and witchcraft to live lives of luxury and superiority. Death was the last thing they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dignity? It meant nothing compared to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the world of wizards, there was no right or wrong&mdash;only strength. Monica had ruled because she was the strongest. Rock betrayed her when his strength surpassed hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Yvonne wasn't the most powerful, but she had Alexander's protection. None of them dared challenge her authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander turned to Shadow. "Leave fifty people behind to assist Yvonne in managing the City of Sorcery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shadow nodded and quickly made the arrangements. Once everything was settled, Alexander addressed Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, don't disappoint me. Handle this well," he said sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Master. I'll do my best," Yvonne replied respectfully, bowing her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander cast one last glance at her before leaving with Shadow and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Alexander was out of sight, Yvonne straightened up and turned to face the remaining wizards. Her eyes gleamed with a mix of arrogance and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew their loyalty was superficial at best. They knelt now, but they weren't truly convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fine, she thought coldly. I'll use Master's lingering authority to crush their defiance before it has a chance to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Basil, Cade, Zane..." Yvonne called out a dozen names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were wizards she had personally recruited, individuals who had always supported her. Now was the time to reward their loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chosen wizards stepped forward, their faces lighting up with excitement. This was their moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne addressed them with authority. "From this day forward, you are the new elders of the City of Sorcery. Anyone who dares disobey you&mdash;kill them without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And if you remain loyal to me, I will personally ask Mr. Hawthorne to reward you with an amulet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words stunned the hall into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More amulets? If Yvonne spoke the truth, Alexander truly had many of those rare and powerful treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dozen newly appointed elders were frozen in shock before breaking into ecstatic cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Baird!" they shouted in unison, their voices brimming with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their enthusiasm quickly spread to the remaining wizards. Fear of Alexander mingled with greed as they clamored to show their loyalty, hoping for a chance to gain an amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne smirked, easily reading their thoughts. Greedy cowards. You'll fall in line as long as there's something to gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as the wizards pledged their loyalty, the guests who had come to celebrate the City of Sorcery's anniversary were still struggling to process what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The carnage was etched into their minds. The sight of Monica and Rock&mdash;once the city's rulers&mdash;lying dead on the floor sent shivers through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The City of Sorcery had a new master, and the power dynamics had shifted irrevocably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's cold gaze swept across the room, her lips curling into a sneer. She let out a soft, derisive laugh.</span></p></div>
