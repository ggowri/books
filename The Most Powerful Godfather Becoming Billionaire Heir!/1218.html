        <h1>Chapter 1218 Sharpening Himself</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's eyes widened as he gripped his massive sword tightly, radiating a fierce killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jonah, watch yourself!" Quentin barked, his tone sharp and commanding. "You might have impressive powers, but you're still a soldier. Follow orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin blocked Jonah's path without hesitation, his own presence surging with the strength of a level-three metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah exclaimed in surprise, "Looks like you've recovered from your injuries and even gained significant strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!" Quentin said, clenching his fist with excitement. "Thanks to Alexander, I'm fully healed! Tonight's mission is one I'll personally lead. It's been too long since I've fought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin's gaze burned with determination as he raised his fist in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jonah, take some time to understand the situation with your brother, Gael. He's the one responsible for his predicament," Quentin continued firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a fair man, but you can't act recklessly. If you ruin this mission, you'll have to face the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah stood silent for a </span><span>moment,</span><span> his expression conflicted. Finally, he said slowly, "No matter what, Gael is my brother. He's been humiliated, his face swollen from being beaten. As his older brother, I can't just stand by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I promise you, General Thompson. I'll focus on the bigger picture. Once the operation is over, I'll deal with Alexander myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin nodded, satisfied with Jonah's concession. He knew Jonah, no matter how strong, wasn't a match for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin then turned his attention to rallying the troops and preparing for the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah, meanwhile, pulled out his phone and called his brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the video call connected, Gael's face appeared on the screen&mdash;swollen and bruised beyond recognition. He lay on a bed, looking utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael's eyes lit up when he saw Jonah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jonah, did you already teach Alexander a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet," Jonah replied. "Now's not the right time. The operation is about to begin. If I pick a fight with Alexander now, it'll stir up trouble, and even I'll get punished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. As soon as the mission's over, I'll make sure to get justice for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's brow furrowed as he took in his brother's battered face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I trust you, Jonah. It's true this isn't the best time. But once the mission's done, with your strength, taking care of Alexander will be a breeze," Gael said, though reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gael felt indignant, he wasn't foolish. He understood that now wasn't the time to act and that they had to wait until the operation was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that Ilona&mdash;she's no better. She actually told me to let it go and sided with Alexander! She's nothing but a backstabber!" Gael cursed bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ilona?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's voice turned cold as he said, "Ilona isn't simple. Don't provoke her. If Alexander managed to beat her so easily, he's probably got Advanced firearm powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's strange, though. Alexander seems to have found a way to hide his metahuman energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But firearm power users are no match for metahumans like me. When the time comes, I'll definitely win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jonah, of course I believe in you. Alexander is going to lose, no question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gael cheered his brother on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get some rest. Don't worry about anything else," Jonah said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah ended the video call and ran his hand over his massive sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... This sword of mine, you won't be able to handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah swung the massive blade lightly, and it sliced through the air like a cascading waterfall, making the nearby team members scatter in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power and speed, perfectly balanced!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, Alexander, I'm a metahuman with dual powers. You're absolutely no match for me," Jonah sneered with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was only a level-four metahuman, he was on the verge of breaking through to level five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, since you're even stronger than Ilona, you'll be my whetstone. I'll use you to sharpen my skills and help me achieve level-five powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonah's voice brimmed with sharp determination, tinged with a hint of excitement and anticipation.</span></p></div>
