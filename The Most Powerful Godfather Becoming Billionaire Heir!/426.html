        <h1>Chapter 426 Massage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No woman can resist the allure of beauty, especially someone as stunning as Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned. "Of course! And after my massage, the results will be even better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to give it a try," Ava replied, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my woman; how could I not help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lingered on Ava's captivating figure, and he couldn't suppress his fantasies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about, you tease?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava sensed his lingering eyes and playfully nestled into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip, Alexander lifted Ava and strode toward the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his earlier rendezvous with Betty, he had absorbed the Force from James.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could enjoy a moment of intimacy with Ava, he would gain even more Force, perhaps enough to carve out all one hundred and eight </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought excited him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava, feeling bold, let her towel drop to the floor, revealing her stunningly flawless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fresh from the shower, her skin glowed with a rosy hue, radiating health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breasts swayed gently with every breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to resist, Alexander licked his lips and applied the beauty cream to Ava's bosom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he used the Force to massage her. With a blend of warmth and cooling essence that seeped into her skin, she shivered with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tingling sensation spread from her chest, radiating throughout her body, opening every pore and leaving Ava feeling light and euphoric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's hands traveled down to her slender waist, thighs, and perfectly rounded backside, he felt his crotch getting tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face flushed as waves of pleasure washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was like a hard-working gardener, working hard to take care of his wonderful garden, kneading and massaging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" she gasped, squirming under his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a bit longer; let me finish the massage first," Alexander teased, his hands exploring her with an almost magical touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The electrifying sensations kept pushing against Ava's mental barriers while he tried to control his own urges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued, the enchanting view between her thighs became more visible, shimmering with a soft glow, inviting him further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickened the flow of Force, letting the cream absorb deeper into her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Ava gazed at Alexander and suddenly asked, "Have you given Brittany massages like this too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused, his expression a mix of surprise and amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava pouted, noticing the undeniable bulge forming in his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides Brittany, do you give massages like this to other women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, but I'd love to keep giving you massages regularly," Alexander replied smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's face lit up with joy, instinctively pressing her rear against him, seeking more contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to say you want to marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander playfully pointed out her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I'm just asking! You haven't even proposed, how could I marry you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava turned her head away, annoyed at Alexander's teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women who've been captivated by my dick all want to marry me," he joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puh! Who would want your dick? So shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava reached into his pants, giving him a firm tug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He inhaled sharply, forcing a grin. "Don't do that. I haven't finished yet, and the cream hasn't reached its full effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his growing desire, Alexander focused on his task, his hands skillfully working on Ava's curves, especially her bosom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force gathered in his palms as he kneaded and caressed. One hand was insufficient; it took both to fully appreciate her softness as he worked his fingers in a tantalizing rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's responses became more frantic, sending her closer to ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of husband do you want?" Alexander suddenly inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flirtatious glance, Ava met his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want someone capable... someone who can hold their own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How capable are you thinking? Is my stamina enough for you, say, for an hour without stopping?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Puh! Screw you," Ava shot back, a mix of shyness and annoyance in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued to massage, Alexander couldn't help but steal glances at her smooth, fair thighs.</span></p></div>
