        <h1>Chapter 605 Heavy Losses</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's icy gaze swept across the Morris Estate, radiating a chilling aura that </span><span>enveloped the entire compound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air grew frigid, and many of the weaker members of the Morris family felt as though they were standing in the glacial region, shivering uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible pressure bore down on everyone as if a mountain were rolling toward them, leaving them breathless and gasping for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Morris family members, already pale, swayed on their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those with more power appeared equally shaken, their faces ashen and beads of sweat forming on their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the high-ranking members in the conference room, including Frederick and Felix, found their bodies stiffening under the weight of Alexander's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate attempt to regain control, Frederick and the others unleashed their own energy, causing the floorboards to crack under the strain of their combined power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their efforts, the force of Alexander's presence only intensified, leaving them feeling utterly impotent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander strode forward, his expression impassive, and not a single member of the Morris family dared to obstruct his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta followed closely behind, his eyes glinting with the promise of violence; anyone who dared to cross them would be met with swift retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bodies fell in their wake, blood pooling on the ground as the cries of the Morris family echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's gaze remained cold, even contemptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such enemies were not worthy of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Rumen Morris, a senior elder of the family, charged forward with a group of skilled fighters at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with fury as he locked onto Alexander, who appeared to be taking a leisurely stroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little punk! How dare you come to the Morris family and cause trouble? You must be looking for a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced at the furious Rumen and smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single one of you will leave here alive today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Attack!" Rumen bellowed, gesturing for his men to surround Alexander in a fan formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was icy as he commanded, "Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storm of murderous intent erupted in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was the first to act, a deadly flash of a blade slicing through the crowd with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange angle of the attack caught them off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! How dare you strike first!" Rumen </span><span>roared,</span><span> his face contorted with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Augusta and unleashed his level-one freezing power, aiming to immobilize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta chuckled, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a level-two metahuman with a composite power like him, Rumen's freezing power felt like a cool breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, a submachine gun materialized in his left hand, aimed </span><span>squarely at Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire erupted, bullets screaming through the air and tearing into the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams filled the air as blood splattered and bodies crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You coward! Using a gun?!" Rumen shouted, his fury boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Augusta's blade struck Rumen's right arm, blood gushing forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Rumen had managed to retreat just in time; otherwise, he would have been cleaved in two. As it stood, his right arm was barely hanging on, reduced to a mere thread of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dazed and filled with regret, Rumen couldn't help but wonder why he had charged in recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How dare you harm the Morris family!" Weston roared in outrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Weston barreled in like a wild beast, his eyes ablaze upon seeing the devastation wrought upon his kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been entrusted by Frederick with the critical task of safeguarding the family, yet here he was, witnessing the annihilation of four camps, including the Tiger Strike Squad, all at the hands of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Weston didn't step up now, it wouldn't matter if Alexander spared his life; Frederick would ensure his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire continued unabated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was a marksman with deadly accuracy, and the Morris family members fell like wheat before a harvester, collapsing in droves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weston tried to close the gap, but as a level-two metahuman, he found himself outmatched by Augusta's speed power. No matter how hard he pushed himself, he could only trail behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his comrades being turned into a sieve, Weston seethed with rage. The Morris family had never suffered such humiliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy losses were a bitter pill for Weston to swallow, and he vowed to exact revenge for every fallen member.</span></p></div>
