        <h1>Chapter 1104 It's No Good</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alexander was about to act, a deep, authoritative voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Howard, who are you arguing with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A middle-aged man, impeccably dressed in a sharp suit, stepped out from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, come here quickly! Grace has been tricked by this fraud. He promised to treat Gavin, but it's all a lie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard, seeing the middle-aged man, instantly brightened, rushing forward to be the first to report the "wrongdoings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace quickly introduced, "Jaden, this is Alexander. I brought him here to treat Gavin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden's brow furrowed, his sharp gaze scanning Alexander from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander met his stare without flinching, and the intensity in his eyes caused Jaden to pause, a brief flicker of surprise crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden's voice was cold as he addressed Alexander, "Mr. Hawthorne, I remember you claiming to have healed Gavin's old injury, is that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander nodded, "That's correct. And I believe this time&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish, Jaden cut him off with a swift wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, the Lawson family has already given you a chance. The truth is, not only did you fail to heal Gavin, but you've made his condition worse. Now, he's hanging on by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, it's over. Please leave," Jaden added firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace, frustrated and unwilling to give in, quickly interjected, "Jaden, after Alexander treated Gavin last time, didn't Gavin's health improve significantly? Alexander believes that someone's tampering with his treatment this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have to let Alexander try again. He's the only one who can save Gavin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed Alexander's arm, pulling him toward the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden stepped forward, blocking their path, "I'm sorry, but I've already hired a renowned expert to treat him. You can't go in and disturb the treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A renowned expert?" Grace paused, clearly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden's face showed a smug satisfaction as he continued, "Yes, I've hired Professor Matt, a Bell Medical Award recipient. He's a top expert in cardiovascular and neurological fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just before I came out, Professor Matt was treating Gavin, and his condition has already shown significant improvement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's heart raced at the news, her face lighting up with hope. "Jaden, is this true? Has Gavin really improved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace became visibly agitated, her sole concern being Gavin's health. Whether or not Alexander had truly healed him was of little importance to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander let out a quiet sigh of relief. It seemed that Gavin hadn't been sabotaged&mdash;his condition must have been due to a sudden illness after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Howard, seeing that Alexander had fallen silent, couldn't resist sneering, "Well, well. Earlier, you were so cocky, but now? We've got Dr. Matt here, a giant in the medical world. He's a real heavyweight&mdash;someone whose reputation is known worldwide. You're no match for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jaden shot a cold glance at Alexander before turning back to Grace. "Grace, now that Gavin's condition has improved, we don't need outsiders causing a scene. Let's not disturb him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Grace could respond, a cry of alarm rang out from inside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Disaster! Disaster! Gavin's deteriorating fast... he's not going to make it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone froze in shock, particularly Jaden, who staggered back in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face went pale, and he quickly abandoned any thoughts of Grace or Alexander, rushing inside with frantic urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, please hang on!" he shouted, panic seizing him as he entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, chaos had erupted. The room was in disarray, with people shouting and crying, the sound of panic filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gale, Grace's father, was there too, his eyes bloodshot, his fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike his incompetent brother Jaden, Gale knew the true weight of the Lawson family's position. It wasn't just about wealth or power&mdash;it was about Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gavin was the pillar of the Lawson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Gavin stood strong, the family could thrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if something happened to him, their influence, their status&mdash;it would all come crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their enemies would waste no time seizing the opportunity, ready to tear the Lawson family apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace's face turned ashen as she grabbed Alexander's hand, pulling him into the room with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes immediately found the center of the chaos&mdash;a bed where Gavin lay, motionless. His face was a sickly gray, his body completely still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A team of medical staff surrounded him, working frantically with advanced equipment, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were shut tight, and the air around him was thick with the smell of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fresh, bright red stain on the pillow beside him was a clear sign that he had coughed up blood just moments ago.</span></p></div>
