        <h1>Chapter 1250 One Wish</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with their modern weaponry, the sheer number of beasts was overwhelming&mdash;an endless sea of creatures far surpassing the human population.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a crucial moment, a mysterious figure in black appeared behind the horde, emitting a strange whistle that echoed through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the tide of beasts halted, regrouping as they surged toward the walls from all directions once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the remaining red gorillas didn't charge ahead; instead, they hid within the mass of creatures, directing the countless expendables to launch their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of gunfire and explosions filled the air, a relentless symphony of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the area outside the makeshift walls was littered with the carcasses of beasts, blood pooling into small streams that flowed in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour slipped by in the heat of battle, and Alexander's ammunition supplies had dwindled by more than half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the mutated beasts had suffered immensely as well; their bodies lay piled high, some even ablaze, while rivers of blood coursed through the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As another thirty minutes passed, with ammunition running low, the corpses of the mutated beasts began to stack closer to the walls, forming a growing mountain of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many agile creatures, like the mutated wolves, cats, and dogs, could occasionally leap onto the walls, causing casualties before being dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the dire situation, Alexander remained calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directed Augusta and the others, forming a strike team with Norah, rushing to where the danger was most imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hours of intense combat were draining, testing their endurance and willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander and his team pressed on, fatigue was etched on the faces of others, and their confidence wavered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they looked out over the endless expanse of mutated beasts, it became clear that </span><span>the thousands they had slain were merely a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a horde of 100 thousand; it was creeping close to 200 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, those on rotation were resting, worry plastered across their faces, sweat soaking their clothes, and dirt mingling with their blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, do you think those monsters will break through?" a young man suddenly asked the woman beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was strikingly handsome, no more than twenty, radiating youthful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter, kid? Are you scared? I knew it. You pretty boys are all the same&mdash;afraid of a little monster. Looks like men really can't be relied on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona Earwood scoffed, sharpening her machete on a whetstone while casting a disdainful glance at the young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? When did I say I was scared?" he retorted, brow furrowed, ready to snap back but ultimately biting his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, I've only been on the job for a couple of weeks. I owe you for showing me the ropes. So, thanks in advance, just in case I bite the dust before I get to tell you,</span><span>" he</span><span> said, flashing a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh... what's the point of saying any of this now? If we go down, we all go down together," Fiona sighed, her voice heavy with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young guy fell silent, staring intently at Fiona. For the first time, his gaze was aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, kid, why are you staring at me like that? Got something on my face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona wiped her face and looked at him, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she had a tomboyish personality, being stared at by a guy made her a bit uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young guy didn't speak. Instead, he snatched the machete from Fiona's hand and started sharpening it with forceful strokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I look at you, Fiona? I heard the military is supposed to come to our rescue, but who knows when? We might be dead long before they get here... Too bad we don't have more ammo. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to fear those monsters. We'd send them all to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona watched as he kept muttering while sharpening the </span><span>machete</span><span>. Gradually, her gaze shifted from the blade to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was pretty handsome, and his youthful energy made him even more appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, Fiona had a close friend who looked a bit like him. They used to play and swim together, and Fiona would joke about marrying him when they grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Fiona lost in thought and her cheeks turning a shade of pink, the young guy glanced around. The others were either exhausted and resting or back on the wall, helping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in close to Fiona's ear and whispered, "Hey, Fiona... I've never been with a woman. Before I die, I have one wish. Can you fulfill it?"</span></p></div>
