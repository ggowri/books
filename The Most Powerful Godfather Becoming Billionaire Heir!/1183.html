        <h1>Chapter 1183 Incredible</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Clement. We will take care of everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several chefs patted their chests in assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, the beef should be sliced thinly against the grain. The moisture content of the meat must be strictly controlled</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>neither too much nor too dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The onions should be cut into fine shreds. Besides that, use beef bones to make the broth, adding beef fat," Alexander instructed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the chefs felt that Alexander was deliberately making things difficult for them, they had no choice but to prepare according to his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ingredients were readily available, and they quickly got everything ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chefs shook their heads, thinking, "Could a plate of beef pasta be considered a competitive dish? No matter how well he makes it, can it really be better than the exquisite dishes Mr. Clement produces? That is impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander began mixing several types of flour together, preparing to make the pasta himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, why don't we just forget about the bet and tie him up instead? We can toss him into the sea to feed the sharks," William suggested loudly, glaring fiercely at Dulles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Dulles turned pale, losing all color from his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe also worried that if Alexander lost, he would lose his dignity, so she quietly advised, "Boss, don't bother with someone like him. Just let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I want to see if my cooking skills have improved," Alexander calmly smiled as he continued to mix the flour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To enhance the pasta's texture, Alexander used the Force to knead the dough, achieving a consistency that was neither too hard nor too soft, yet very elastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then placed the dough into a pasta machine, quickly extruding the fine pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles watched as Alexander awkwardly made the pasta, wearing a victorious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned on the heat and placed a pot of water to boil for the pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he added various seasonings to the prepared beef bone broth, measuring each one precisely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Putting on a show, making him look like a real chef."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just pretending. That kid is definitely going to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chefs discussed among themselves, looking forward to mocking Alexander once he finished the plate of beef pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles sighed and shook his head, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, why don't you just admit defeat? I'll give you a discount of 100 thousand dollars, and you can give me 900 thousand dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." Alexander shot him a cold glance, exuding a chilling aura that frightened Dulles and his group, making their faces turn pale and their bodies tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen fell silent, and no one dared to interrupt Alexander anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alexander calmly prepared a plate of beef pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Dulles thought the pasta was quite ordinary, but when Alexander finished cooking the pasta and added the beef bone broth along with various toppings and beef, Dulles' expression changed. The kitchen filled with an enticing aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the scent that a simple plate of beef pasta can emit?" Dulles found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were him making it, while it would have a pleasant aroma, it would never be this exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Dulles' astonished expression, Alexander smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the others didn't grasp the uniqueness of the pasta yet, Dulles, being an experienced chef, could not ignore the intricacies of the dish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had mastered the timing and amounts of the seasonings to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dulles could never imagine that Alexander had used the Force to enhance the flavors of the food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the dough for the pasta had been kneaded with the Force, giving it a texture that no other pasta could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dulles felt the aroma becoming increasingly tempting, making his mouth water uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others couldn't help but stare at the plate of pasta, all filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a plate of beef pasta. But why does it smell so good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible. I've never smelt such an aromatic beef pasta before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is truly incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other chefs exclaimed, feeling utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you can try it now." Alexander finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen was particularly quiet, as everyone still hadn't fully regained their composure, drawn in by the enticing aroma of the pasta.</span></p></div>
