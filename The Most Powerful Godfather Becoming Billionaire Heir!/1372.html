        <h1>Chapter 1372 A Crushing Defeat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young flagbearer stood atop his horse. With a light step, the steed neighed sharply as he leaped into the air, closely following behind Josh, heading straight for the estate walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, dozens of men charged forward, hauling several siege ladders directly toward the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of the wall, Alexander's expression was ice-cold, his face devoid of emotion as he murmured to himself, "Hm... Strong energy. A level-four warrior... and a level-three warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would be in a good mood if their home was attacked in the dead of night. His voice was frigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take the one with the blade. Vegeta, the kid is yours. Logan, Nova, stay with the guards and hold the fort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh landed smoothly on the estate wall and couldn't help but grin. The estate was as good as his!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just a few yards away, a young man in a blue robe stood watching him coldly, his piercing gaze sharp as lightning, his presence as deep as an abyss. It was Alexander. How effortless it was to find him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flashed with a savage gleam. His figure blurred as he suddenly appeared beside Alexander. The air split apart with a deafening roar as his nine-ring broadsword flared with a foot-long crimson glow, slashing straight toward Alexander's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold scoff. "You're much slower than Rhodes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His toes tapped the ground, and in an instant, a blinding green light burst forth. He had already moved behind Josh. A deafening crack of thunder rang out as his elbow, sharp as a spear, struck straight for his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in shock. "A level-four warrior?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he spun his broadsword in a wide arc, unleashing a blazing red energy that enveloped his entire body like a raging inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander suddenly dropped lower, sweeping his leg out in a ferocious kick. The sheer force of it howled like a storm, crashing straight toward his ankles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh stomped down hard. A surge of red energy blasted out as he propelled himself into the air. His broadsword came crashing down with a force like a collapsing mountain, its crimson glow splitting through the night, aiming straight for Alexander's skull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of murderous intent flickered in Alexander's eyes. He slammed both palms against the ground, causing an eruption of green energy. His body spun like a whirlwind, Arhat Spin!&nbsp;A flurry of relentless kicks bombarded Josh from below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each kick was fiercer than the last. Each strike more devastating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh took hit after hit. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he was sent flying like a ragdoll, his entire body convulsing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it. Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a sharp roar. His foot tapped the ground. He shot into the air like a soaring dragon, charging straight toward the airborne Josh. A piercing, earth-shattering crack echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A devastating whip kick struck Josh square in the back. BOOM! He plummeted like a falling star, crashing straight into the courtyard wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander landed gracefully, arms folded behind his back, his sharp eyes locked onto the blood-soaked Josh lying in the deep crater. His voice was barely above a whisper, "I'm no level-four warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh's eyes widened in horror. It was like being struck by lightning on a clear day, like having a bucket of ice water poured over his entire body. He was frozen in shock, unable to move, as if he had turned to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young flagbearer's massive flag spun through the air, shifting between a spear, a staff, and a blade as he fiercely battled Vegeta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just moments, Josh had been completely taken down. The young flagbearer's face paled with terror. He let out a desperate roar, "Sun Piercing Arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurled his flag like a shooting star, streaking toward Vegeta before turning to flee toward the outskirts of the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trying to run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta's eyes blazed with fury. Letting out a deep roar, he lowered his stance and stepped forward like a drawn bow. His body twisted, both hands forming claw-like shapes at his waist, resembling the petals of a blooming flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sparks of dazzling electricity crackled around his entire body. Countless radiant silver-white light particles converged in his palms, forming a blinding, mysterious orb of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy... Wave... Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Vegeta's thunderous roar, he thrust both palms forward. The blinding energy sphere morphed into a dazzling beam of light, cutting through space and time, slamming straight into the young flagbearer's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!&nbsp;A massive explosion erupted. The young flagbearer's body turned pitch black, and he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy Plot Attack!" In that instant, Vegeta, a level-three warrior, unleashed such immense power. "He definitely reached level-four!" Alexander's jaw dropped, unable to close his mouth for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the hundreds of bandits had only just reached the moat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, both the level-four warrior Josh and the level-three flagbearer had been utterly defeated. The bandits immediately fell into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the estate's drawbridge was lowered, and the gates swung open. Logan and Nova led over a hundred men charging out, cutting down enemies on sight with unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bandits, though well-trained, had lost their leaders. Their morale was completely shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vegeta's people were warriors who had fought against the Noah Empire on the Noah Continent. In an instant, the bandits were completely overwhelmed, scattering in disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vegeta's limbs felt heavy and sore. He barely managed to walk up to Alexander, offering a respectful salute before speaking with pride, "Sir! What do you think of the Energy Plot Attack I mastered?"</span></p></div>
