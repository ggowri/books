        <h1>Chapter 224 Feeding the Sharks</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredibly, an island owned by a drug lord was guarded like a military base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the yacht docked at the pier, seven or eight fully armed guards rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked ferocious and pointed their weapons at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they found something wrong, they would fire violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are a team. I am Edison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly made some specific gestures to the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards put down their guns only after seeing Alexander's gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come over and let us check your identity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Alexander and carefully checked Edison's photos and information, but did not find any flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edison, right? You scared me. Next time you come, you must follow the rules and get approval first. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards finally relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't go through the procedures, many people who come to the island do this without reporting in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander was from the group, they would not stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your hard work. This is just a small token of my appreciation. Sorry to bother you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sensibly took out a stack of banknotes and stuffed the money into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the guards burst into laughter, patted Alexander on the shoulder, and thanked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured to Alice, asking her to go back to the yacht and wait for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Alexander didn't know what would happen next. He was not afraid of any </span><span>enemy alone, and he could escape at any time even if he couldn't defeat them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Alice came with him, it would be hard to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice watched from afar as Alexander walked towards the island. His tall and handsome figure made her feel mixed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked along the street towards the center of the island. The wireless headphones he was wearing were a GPS locator with a camera and transmission function.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took photos of everything he saw and uploaded them to the drive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander looked at Treasure Island on the boat, he saw that it had many buildings and was very prosperous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once he entered the periphery, it was so dirty and messy, as if he'd arrived at a messy slum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a strange smell in the air, mixed with the salty and humid sea breeze, making him even more difficult to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around were of different appearances, skin colors, and races. They all looked ferocious and exuded a cruel and sinister temperament. It was obvious that they were not good people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was paradise in the eyes of criminals, hell in the eyes of good people, and an international hub for black market transactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander headed towards the center of the island. The tallest building there was the trading center and warehouse of the Brilliant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to intelligence, Guzman might be hiding in that building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander came to the fork in an alley and was wondering which way to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You're looking around, are you new here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me ten thousand dollars right now, or I'll chop you up and throw you into the sea to feed the sharks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man, Johnny suddenly rushed over and pointed a sharp machete at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a machete used by fishermen to kill fish. The sharp blade had a slight red tinge, and it was unclear whether it was stained with fish blood or human blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny was half a head taller than Alexander, with a sturdy and strong build. He thought that Alexander was already in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, should I say you have good eyesight or that you are blind? You guessed right, I am indeed new here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's not a wise move for you to provoke me. If I were you, I would put the knife away and get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was delighted when he heard Alexander's words, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to scare me? I want one hundred thousand dollars now, transfer the money quickly, or I'll chop you to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. This place was indeed a paradise for criminals, with robbery taking place in broad daylight. Moreover, several people were watching from a distance, all of them watching with great interest as if they were enjoying a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Johnny pointed the knife at Alexander's chest and threatened again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are no laws or police here. No one can save you. We only care about strength. </span><span>If you don't want to die, you have to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked directly at the other person and said, "I have decided to chop you up and throw you into the sea to feed the sharks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, it looks like you've met a tough guy today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few onlookers laughed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob was immediately furious and said, "Do you want to die? I'll grant your wish!"</span></p></div>
