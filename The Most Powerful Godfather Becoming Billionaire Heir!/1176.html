        <h1>Chapter 1176 Inspection</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the video call, Alexander thought it was time to move the headquarters from </span><span>Loscity</span><span> to Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there was a knock on the door. The door was pushed open, and Alice walked in, holding a thick stack of documents, her high heels clicking on the floor as she swayed her hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you haven't come to the office for so long. Ms. Blackburn has already looked over these financial statements. Do you want to take a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice looked at Alexander with a pitiful expression. She had been feeling quite deprived lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand. "Okay, bring them over for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alice had taken the initiative to come to him, he felt he couldn't disregard her effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the reports and quickly skimmed through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Alexander became an Advanced Warrior, his eyesight, memory, and comprehension abilities had greatly improved. His brain functioned like a supercomputer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice bent down, wanting to explain the contents of the reports to Alexander in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Alexander flipped through the pages faster and faster, she was left speechless in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, how do you read so quickly?" Alice couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly and said, "I can tell with just a glance if there are any mistakes or omissions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I don't believe it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice pouted and then leaned closer to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unique fragrance of a mature woman filled the air, and Alexander found it extremely pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her full bosom touched his shoulder. The soft and elastic sensation was delightful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled, "Do you want to have some breakfast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What breakfast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice was taken aback, thinking Alexander was asking if she wanted to eat breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alice could react, Alexander pressed her down, making her squat between his </span><span>legs, smiling as he said, "Let's eat something high in protein. It can also serve as a beauty treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, you are so bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice teased, blushing as she unzipped Alexander's pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander looked at the reports, he enjoyed the service from his secretary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, until Alice's mouth and hands became tired and sore, Alexander finally reached his climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice coughed repeatedly, looking pitifully at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but laugh. "Not now. Maybe tonight. I'll call you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alice stand up happily. But her legs were already numb, and she nearly fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly supported her, using the Force to massage her legs a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice felt a warm current sweep over her body, and soon, her legs felt normal again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending Alice away, Alexander opened his computer and began to check the recent hot news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson had already started advertising the benefits of the "Immortality Serum" which was quite expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that he had gained support from many top figures and even obtained permission from several countries. Otherwise, he wouldn't dare to be so blatant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called Immortality Serum indeed had its unique characteristics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, eliminating the side effects of the drug and allowing humanity to achieve immortality was against the laws of nature and impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander estimated that those who had been deceived into using the Immortality Serum, besides being controlled by Yinson, would either become living dead or zombies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to transfer everyone to the island as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt that time was of the essence and prepared to find Ava to discuss it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, around Treasure Island Square, dozens of construction machines were operating, and hundreds of workers were laboring hard. Although the sea breeze was cool, they were still sweating profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, you did well. Where did you find so many skilled workers?" Alexander asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William grinned with pride. "We are willing to spend money, offering three times the salary to bring them here and providing room and board. They all sought this job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded in satisfaction. "How is the equipment for the arsenal coming along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, don't worry. We are already able to produce various calibers of bullets, grenades, and landmines. But we still need to stockpile more raw materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The warehouse already has 200 thousand automatic rifles, 20 thousand light machine guns, 10 thousand heavy machine guns, five thousand rocket launchers and grenade launchers, as well as three thousand mortars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William gave Alexander a detailed report on the weapons stored in the warehouse, which was enough to arm an army of 100 thousand.</span></p></div>
