        <h1>Chapter 1232 Personal Rescue Mission</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you noticed if these beasts are showing unusually high intelligence, or if someone might be controlling them?" Alexander asked, his expression dead serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The big guy shook his head. "Can't say I've spotted anything like that. All I know is they're savage. They'll tear apart anyone they see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it wasn't for running into some survivors at the last minute, I probably wouldn't have made it back. To be honest, except for the port area, I don't think many people in </span><span>Louvian</span><span> stood a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was grim as he recalled the horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kept his poker face but didn't press for more details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mood in the room got heavy </span><span>real</span><span> quick&mdash;this whole mutant beast situation had thrown a major wrench in his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't stock up on supplies at Treasure Island and Devil Island before Yinson kicked off </span><span>his</span><span> </span><span>Apocalypse Project, anyone stuck on those islands would basically be signing up for a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mulling it over for a bit, Alexander called in Betty, Augusta, Marvin, and the others to figure out their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These mutant beasts are moving like a tidal wave, destroying everything in their path," Alexander explained. "Even with all their weapons and ammo, Karson and his crew at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port are running on fumes. They're short-handed. It's only a matter of time before they're overwhelmed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news hit Augusta and the others like a ton of bricks. They stood there looking lost, trying to wrap their heads around the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when they thought they had everything under control, Yinson pulled another twisted stunt, derailing their evacuation plans with this terrifying monster situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that </span><span>Loscity's</span><span> quiet means Yinson's targeting us specifically. We can't lose </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port. We've still got tons of supplies that haven't made it to the island yet," Alexander said, scanning the faces of Augusta and the others. He knew he needed to bring some of his friends along this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was stuck between a rock and a hard place&mdash;too few men wouldn't stand a chance against this unknown beast invasion, but too many could lead to an even bigger disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wasn't worried about himself. With his skills, he could either win the fight or at least make a clean getaway. But Augusta and the others were a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing his options, Alexander decided to bring backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't protect the entire port alone, no matter how skilled he was. They needed boots on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he made up his mind, Alexander jumped into action. He had Betty handpick a hundred of their best fighters&mdash;the real backbone of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Charlize and Rosalia would hold down the fort in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, Augusta, Marvin, William, and Logan would join him at </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander leading his four brothers and a hundred elite troops, all geared up for war, they packed more punch than a special ops battalion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander himself was a one-man army&mdash;the kind of warrior who could take out a general in the middle of a million-strong army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something kept nagging at Alexander. He was dead certain Yinson had someone pulling the strings behind this whole mess with the mutated beasts and this sudden stampede.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they took out the leader, these beasts would be easier to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alexander's convoy of twenty pickup trucks was just heading out, Karson was nearly at his wit's end on the makeshift walls of </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several intense firefights, they were running dangerously low on ammo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mutant beasts were proving way harder to kill than humans. Even a mutated sheep could tank several bullets and keep coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Please, somebody help us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desperate screams caught everyone's attention on the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned west, where about half a mile out, they spotted dozens of people running for their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them was a nightmarish sight&mdash;hundreds of mutated animals of all sizes in hot pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mutated rats the size of dogs, cats and dogs as big as tigers and lions, and what used </span><span>to be ordinary farm birds&mdash;chickens and ducks&mdash;they were all massive and bloodthirsty now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fleeing people didn't stand a chance at outrunning them&mdash;these mutants were even faster than normal animals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams kept coming as the beasts picked off the refugees one by one, tearing into them with savage fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall black man was leading the pack of survivors, sprinting toward the port's walls. At his current pace, he'd be within effective firing range soon. If he could just hold on a little longer, they could provide covering fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a horrific screech pierced the air as a mutant wildcat, massive as a tiger, leaped a good twenty feet to pounce on the man from behind.</span></p></div>
