        <h1>Chapter 86 Initiative</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava shot a disapproving glare at Alexander, while Rebecca couldn't help but snicker, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, well, Alexander, you really are something else! Living in Ava's mansion, spending her money, and hiding a sexy maid on the side? What's your game here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize's cheeks flushed crimson as she glanced shyly at Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander hurriedly interjected, "Wait, let me explain. This is Charlize Collins. She's my subordinate, responsible for daily security and cleaning duties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Charlize, meet my girlfriend, Ava Blackburn, the president of the Saint Group," Alexander added, deliberately leaving Rebecca out of the introduction, which only fueled her anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize quickly greeted Ava with warmth, "Hello, Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's expression softened slightly when she heard Alexander declare her his girlfriend, but her eyes still held a hint of skepticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you've turned down my offers for security and cleaning staff because you prefer someone like Charlize, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander leaned in closer, a playful grin on his face. "Jealous, are we? But Charlize isn't just any ordinary person. She used to be part of the Phantom Squad, and she has three other teammates. You know how Sebastian is coming after me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Phantom Squad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's eyes widened as she turned to Charlize, her perception shifting instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So that's how it is! I should've recruited some real heavyweights from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Collins, I apologize for the misunderstanding. I hope you can keep my boyfriend safe," Ava said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Charlize quickly waved her hands, eager to downplay the situation. "Ms. Blackburn, you're too kind. Those guys earlier were no match for bo... Mr. Hawthorne."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She almost slipped up and revealed that Alexander was the boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them continued their conversation, leaving Rebecca feeling utterly sidelined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a huff, she stormed out, slamming the door behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sighed, a mix of amusement and exasperation on her face, "Looks like Rebecca's upset again. I should go check on her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she left, she surprised Alexander with a quick kiss on the cheek, her cheeks tinged pink as she walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but smile. Ava's sudden warmth toward him, likely fueled by her jealousy of Charlize, was a pleasant surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ensuring Rebecca was alright, Ava made her way to find Anne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Sebastian now in Loscity, she was curious why the new chairman hadn't made a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the Saint Group headquarters, in the secretary's office, Anne was lounging back, casually sipping a glass of red wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava burst in, her expression serious. "Ms. Hollister, where's the chairman? Sebastian's in Loscity, and we need to act fast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne looked at her with a knowing smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, the chairman is currently refusing to see anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava's temper flared. "What do you mean? You're just a secretary! Why are you calling the shots? I'm the president of the Saint Group. He's not some secretive figure. Why won't he see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne's pretty face hardened, her tone cool. "Ms. Blackburn, please calm down! I just told you. the chairman has decided not to meet with anyone right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava felt a storm of frustration brewing inside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had a million things to say, but the words caught in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She slammed her palm on the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of nonsense is this? If the Saint Group falls apart because of this, I couldn't care less about your precious chairman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Ava stormed out, her patience completely spent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had zero respect for this mysterious figure now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne could only chuckle to herself, shaking her head as she murmured, "Ava, Ava, you spend every day with him, yet you're completely clueless about your own good fortune..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Fairfax Villa was buzzing with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, thrilled to hear that Sebastian had arrived in Loscity, couldn't wait to share the news with everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! That bastard Alexander won't be gloating for long. The president of the Brilliant Group is here personally. He's going to make Alexander pay for hurting his son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda let out a sharp, unpleasant laugh. "With Ava always covering for him, Alexander finally bit off more than he can chew. Using witchcraft against Mr. Tate? He's in deep trouble now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane, her mood a mix of frustration and resignation, added wearily, "Ava will definitely have his back. And with Alexander's knack for witchcraft, it's hard to say who'll come out on top."</p></div>
