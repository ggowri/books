        <h1>Chapter 845 Abandoning Dignity</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Congratulations, you've passed the first two tests!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you are officially members of the Dragon Gang. Money and women await you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female interviewer delivered an impassioned and provocative speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith and the other men were visibly excited, their eyes gleaming with uncontrollable anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman's tone shifted. "However, there's one final test! Whoever passes this will become our top candidate for training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed theatrically. "It's been a long time since any man passed this last test."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keith was initially surprised but soon grew confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was curious. What was this final test?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second test, hitting the groin with a hard ruler, had been bizarre enough, making Alexander wince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female interviewer chuckled mysteriously. "Who among you is willing to give up your dignity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hall fell silent, and a few of the men looked apprehensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone cautiously asked, "What do we need to give up our dignity for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is willing to be on the receiving end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She walked up to one of the candidates, pressing the ruler under his chin and glaring coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, do you?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man stammered, "D-Does that mean I'll be hit? And maybe... fed weird things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Remembering the sordid scenes from certain movies, the man's Adam's apple quivered, and he couldn't bring himself to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he only wanted to enjoy time with the actresses, not be trampled underfoot or fed filth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're pathetic! Stay a bit player for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The female interviewer shoved him aside harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not one of you is willing? I thought we'd find a rising star this time, but you've all disappointed me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you have any dreams? Don't you want to be our top trainee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman shouted wildly, waving the ruler excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander felt queasy, and Marvin's expression soured. No sane man would agree to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unexpectedly, Keith stepped forward, shouting, "I want to be the top trainee. I'm willing to try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood tall and proud, facing the shocked stares as if he were a warrior ready to face death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was speechless, the thought of Keith possibly being humiliated making him nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood up, patted Marvin on the shoulder, and said, "Leave Keith a contact number for us. I can't watch this anymore. I'm leaving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Alexander quickly left the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, hundreds of people were still lined up, with more continuously arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was at a loss. What were these men in the Risun thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was it so hard to find a decent job? Choosing this kind of bizarre ordeal was just hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Marvin hurried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, I left him the contact info. Where to next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment. "Call Norma and tell her I'm at their headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes after Marvin made the call, a convoy of black Mercedes cars sped over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the middle of the convoy were two black Rolls-Royces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The convoy stopped in front of the building, and from one of the Rolls-Royces stepped an elderly man in his fifties or sixties, dressed in a black martial arts uniform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his age, the man walked steadily, head held high, showing no signs of frailty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes, in particular, shone with a brightness surpassing even that of younger men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The island nation was known for karate and kendo, and this man was clearly a martial arts master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the old man wasn't the main figure. After stepping out, he held the car door respectfully, head slightly bowed, waiting for the real VIP to emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man in his thirties stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the other Rolls-Royce, a young woman emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elderly man followed the pair, head lowered, his expression full of respect.</span></p></div>
