        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Frederick Morris, rest assured, I will get to the bottom of this!" Weston replied, his back drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Frederick losing his temper and slapping Weston had sent a chill down Weston's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Felix and Megan had just wrapped up their wedding ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of the Morris family's dire situation had spread among the guests, and the atmosphere turned tense as many hurriedly made their exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once joyous celebration was now overshadowed by fear and uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick's face darkened with fury as he called for an emergency family meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen high-ranking members of the Morris family filled the conference room, each one a figure of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all seasoned individuals, some already in their </span><span>middle ages</span><span>, and their stern expressions spoke volumes about their status within the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was present, too, but he was relegated to the back of the room, his face clouded with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Red Umbrella Group, no one would dare place him at the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a humiliating slight, and Felix was taking mental notes, vowing to repay this insult tenfold in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like a true servant of the Morris family, harboring a deep well of resentment within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Frederick Morris, who exactly is attacking us?" one of the family members asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick sneered, saying, "We still haven't figured that out. The enemy is either small in number or exceptionally good at hiding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix interjected, "Mr. Frederick Morris, it's highly likely that this enemy is Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Alexander?" Frederick's teeth clenched in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-ranking members of the Morris family began to murmur among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Alexander really that formidable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can he really wipe out the Tiger Strike Squad? That seems a bit far-fetched..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Alexander has some serious guts to come after us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick slammed his hand on the table, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of storms has the Morris family not weathered? We've stood strong to this day&mdash;there's no way a mere Alexander can shake our foundation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our chance to settle the score; he's practically walked into our trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Alexander is digging his own grave; Mr. Frederick Morris is right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our true strength lies with Mr. Frederick Morris. Once he takes action, even if Alexander is a powerhouse, he'll be nothing but a featherweight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with enthusiasm, everyone eager to flatter Frederick, their spirits lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eyes narrowed as he added, "But Alexander's sudden rise is no accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's hiding something big. If we can uncover that secret, we'll be even stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just an outsider; who do you think you are to speak here?" someone snapped at Felix, dismissing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's face darkened further as he wished he could wipe that smug grin off the guy's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick nodded in agreement. "You're right. Alexander must be hiding a colossal secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can seize that secret, not only will we get the formula for magic powder, but we'll also gain immense power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed sparkled in Frederick and Felix's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humanity's insatiable greed was a primal sin, etched into very bones from the moment one was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Weston spoke up, concern etched on his face, "Mr. Frederick Morris, the Tiger Strike Squad's complete annihilation suggests it's not just Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have brought a lot of backups; we can't afford to underestimate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frederick scoffed, saying, "Let's see who's stronger&mdash;Alexander or my sword!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe he can turn the tide on my home turf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix grinned coldly. "Only Alexander's blood can wash away all this hatred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family members exchanged fervent whispers, their spirits high as they plotted how to dismantle Alexander piece by piece and uncover his great secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice filled with authority and menace boomed through the halls, echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, Frederick, come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family members froze, the terrifying voice sending shivers down their spines. They turned in unison toward the source of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alexander strolled through the grand entrance of the Morris Estate, unperturbed, with Augusta following closely behind him.</span></p></div>
