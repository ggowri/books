        <h1>Chapter 1292 Just Walk Away</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought his blow would be enough to crush Maxwell's skull, but it didn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it hit him that all those memories of the Warriors and the apocalypse were false.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of frustration. That's why he had come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected to walk into such an infuriating scene. So, he grabbed a wine bottle and threw it at the thug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of a door slamming loudly snapped Alexander back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of his daze, Maris rushed out and slammed the door shut behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you can run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, Alexander turned to chase after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew if he let this woman get away, he'd be in big trouble. The whole incident would be impossible to explain, and he'd end up in deeper trouble because of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something hot and soft pressed up against his back. A body, warm and delicate, wrapped around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Alexander slipped, and the two of them tumbled onto the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, lady... what are you...? Don't... don't touch me! What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned bright red as he struggled, feeling helpless against her advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Silvia pressed his head firmly into her chest, Alexander felt himself suffocating. It was like being in a heavenly dream. It was so surreal, so tempting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel his eyes redden. He couldn't resist her pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud shout, he pushed forward, lost in the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a dream as if he were holding Ava again, kissing her, caressing her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to blur, and then, after what felt like an eternity, Alexander came to his senses. He couldn't help but glance at Silvia, whose clothes were disheveled. He licked his lips, still caught up in the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare look at me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia raised her hand and slapped him hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Alexander grabbed her wrist with lightning speed. He suddenly felt a strange surge of energy within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He froze. "This is the Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on? Am I really a Warrior? Was everything that happened real, not just a dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia attempted to strike him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to save you. It was you who started it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander stopped speaking. He saw two tears roll down Silvia's devastated face, and his heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia yanked her hand away, trembling with rage. "Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated before asking, "Is this how it's going to end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia's beautiful face twisted with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want from me? Yes, it was me. I was the one who slept with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice dropped with a biting coldness. "But you're just a coward taking advantage of me. You're no better than him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, she kicked Maxwell's unconscious body. But the pain from earlier made her stumble. Her body gave out, and she collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander reacted quickly, catching her in his arms before she hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the air seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia struggled, only to wince in pain from the injury. She groaned softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I was too rash. I'm an intern at Healiva Hospital. I'm just a part-time delivery guy now. Let me check your injuries..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He revealed his current identity, thinking that since he'd felt a trace of the Force again, something must have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was determined to get to the bottom of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shameless bastard, get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia shoved him away, taking a few steps back, her face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief silence, Alexander tried again, "I know it was you who started this, but you're my woman. I can't just walk away like this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia interrupted him with a sharp, mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you think you're going to take responsibility for this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My family isn't the top-tier in Kylaville, but we're still a well-established family. You're just a low-life from the bottom of society. You're not worthy of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "I bet you're trying to use the Hewitt family's money and climb up by riding my coattails, huh? You're clever, I'll give you that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silvia tore into him without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face turned red with anger. He really wanted to push this arrogant woman down and teach her a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! You rich kids only care about money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Normal people might work their whole lives and never even reach your starting point... but I'm not just some ordinary guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit hard and were full of sharpness and life philosophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Silvia didn't know how to respond. She hadn't expected this so-called "scumbag" to speak so sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was always a proud woman, and Alexander's words wouldn't easily silence her.</span></p></div>
