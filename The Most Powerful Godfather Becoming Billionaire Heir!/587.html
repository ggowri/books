        <h1>Chapter 587 Vicious Curse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pervert, let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you all standing around for? Get in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reynolds family surged forward, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Gill's face had turned pale, and she couldn't utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's eyes darted, and he shouted, "You're up to something, Alexander! Poisoning people like this? You think you can pressure everyone into agreeing to you and Nancy being together with such dirty tricks? That's just pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther charged at Alexander with a fierce look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of my wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy quickly stepped in front of Alexander, explaining, "Dad, Alexander isn't like that. Right now, we need to focus on saving Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Alexander had no reason to do such a thing; someone else was clearly pulling the strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard tugged at Clay, pleading, "Clay, you have to save Gill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Gill was a bit out of it, Richard still held her in high regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, please save my wife! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther didn't care about Alexander anymore; he turned to Clay for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all trusted Clay, believing he was the only one who could save Gill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay smirked, feeling triumphant. As long as he could pin this mess on Alexander, he was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I've got this," he said confidently as he walked toward Gill, scolding Alexander, "You filthy animal, get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored him; he was focused on saving Gill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his All-seeing Eyes, he had detected the evil energy inside Gill&mdash;it was clearly some kind of dark curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No doubt about it, Clay was behind this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to help Gill first, not waste time with Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, I'm going to save your mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Alexander pressed his palm against Gill's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Force surged in like a tidal wave. Over the past few days, he had been training with Nancy and Rosalia, and his strength had improved significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful Force could eliminate the dark energy and heal the damaged body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you have some nerve! What kind of trickery is this? You think pretending will make everyone believe your nonsense?" Clay snapped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was fully confident; the curse wasn't just any ordinary magic&mdash;it was something only he could break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't act, Gill would be dead in five minutes, and Alexander would be blamed for murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stood her ground, blocking Clay from getting any closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay shouted angrily at Nancy, "You're being fooled by this guy! He's a killer, and I can help you see his true colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only I can save your mom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may not understand my brilliance now, Nancy, but once we're together, you'll realize I'm destined for greatness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay proclaimed passionately, acting like he was the best man on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! Come any closer, and I'll blow you away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stood firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reynolds household had descended into chaos at the sight of her drawing a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie shouted, "Everyone calm down! I believe Alexander isn't the killer. There's no benefit for him in this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, Alexander interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clay, you used dark curse on Nancy's mom, and now you're trying to frame me? That's downright despicable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay sneered, "Alexander, it doesn't matter how loud you shout; everyone saw it was you pulling the strings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You vile creature, you think you have a future with Nancy? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scoffed, "Are you blind? I've already lifted the curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're full of crap..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's expression shifted dramatically mid-sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt it&mdash;the curse inside Gill had truly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill, who had been unconscious moments before, quickly returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay couldn't believe it; just moments ago, Gill had been on the brink of death, and that had been his strongest curse&mdash;combining voodoo magic, it was deadlier than any poison in the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had Alexander managed to do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even witnessing it firsthand, Clay struggled to comprehend it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression flickered as he realized his own power had indeed grown, and he was a rising star from the City of Sorcery. Why was he facing off against a monster like Alexander?</span></p></div>
