        <h1>Chapter 1267 World in Chaos</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant cat, mid-leap and about to tear into Melin, suddenly froze in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had grabbed it by the neck with an iron grip and twisted hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp sound of breaking bones cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive cat's head hung limp, completely severed. Its body fell to the ground, twitching violently. Those terrifying blood-red eyes were now lifeless and dull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander brought his foot down on the cat's head with crushing force. A series of wet crunching sounds followed as the skull gave way like a watermelon being smashed, spraying blood and tissue across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" Alexander turned to Melin, his voice full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reality finally caught up with Melin. Her face lit up with joy and relief. She couldn't believe Alexander had shown up at the perfect moment to save her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those seconds when she'd faced death, all she could think about were her moments with Alexander. Now, like a dream come true, here he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozens of zombies that had broken into the police station weren't deterred by the mutant cat's death. If anything, the smell of fresh blood drove them into an even greater frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like demons unleashed from hell, they charged toward the survivors with outstretched claws and snapping jaws, Alexander included.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Alexander's sword cleanly decapitated a zombie, sending its head flying through the air before it hit the ground and rolled away with a sickening bounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But zombies knew no fear. They had no concept of terror, charging forward with mindless determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every zombie and mutated beast that dared to approach met the same fate. They were cut down by Alexander's blade, their headless bodies crumpling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin watched in silent awe as the scene unfolded. The other survivors, witnessing Alexander's incredible display of power, smartly huddled close to Melin, seeking the protection of his deadly blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether zombie or mutant beast, anything that came within Alexander's reach fell like lambs to the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The survivors in the police station could barely contain their amazement, stumbling over their words in disbelief. "Dear God... he must be an angel sent from heaven to save us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued to cut down every monster that charged forward while slowly backing away with Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a matter of minutes, dozens of zombies and mutated beasts lay scattered at Alexander's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their incredible vitality kept them from truly dying&mdash;severed limbs twitched and writhed on the ground in a grotesque dance of undeath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The zombies were the worst of it, dragging themselves across the floor in trails of black blood. The whole scene looked like something straight out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More zombies and mutant beasts kept pouring into the police station, baring their fangs and claws as they launched savage attacks at the survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led everyone to retreat into the hallway, directing survivors to either escape through the back entrance by the wall or hole up in the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Ava held their ground at the hallway entrance, turning the narrow space into a killing field. Within minutes, the bodies of zombies and mutant beasts were piled up like a mountain of carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after every survivor had cleared out did Alexander finally grab Melin and bolt from there like a bat out of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew better than to make a last stand at the station. Getting trapped there would've been a death sentence, plain and simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, we actually made it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we're alive! Now let's get the hell out of Loscity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of survivors burst out through the station's back door, letting out huge sighs of relief when they found the back streets mercifully quiet. There were no monsters in sight, at least for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They collapsed onto the ground, their legs giving out as the adrenaline finally wore off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the command center of the Kingsdon Military Headquarters, dozens of generals sat in the circular command room. Among them were five-star generals, but the majority were lieutenant generals and major generals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin sat among them, his face stern and grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could have predicted this catastrophe that had suddenly descended upon them. The crisis wasn't limited to Loscity. Dozens of cities and counties across the nation were simultaneously experiencing unimaginable horrors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zombies and mutated beasts were spreading rapidly across the regions. This wasn't just affecting one country&mdash;mutant beasts were appearing all over Earthia, in every nation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This emergency meeting at military headquarters had been called by some of the generals to address the crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many of their colleagues had already abandoned their posts, declaring they no longer supported the President and instead pledged their loyalty to the Ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In these chaotic times, with the nation on the brink of collapse, less than half of the seats were filled in what should have been a full house at this highest-level emergency meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the empty chairs belonged to senior military leaders&mdash;mainly generals and lieutenant generals who commanded various military regions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These absent leaders had lived lives of privilege and power as beneficiaries of the system. Now, they sought immortality, desperate to preserve their families' wealth and status for generations to come.</span></p></div>
