        <h1>Chapter 514 Human</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong a man was, if he were bitten in the vitals, he would be in pain even if he survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix threatened Danielle with her family, making her dare not resist at all and she could only let him do whatever he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was trembling with fear. Felix had already taken out a strangely shaped sex toy and was ready to enjoy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle looked at Felix resignedly. He was holding a furry toy that looked like a dog's tail, and she felt both fear and wonder in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This...what on earth is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you see tell? Women like to use dog </span><span>tails,</span><span> it will make you very happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled and played with it while saying, "Look, it's long and thin. But it has thorns on it, which is just right for a slut like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While introducing them, Felix still did not forget to touch Danielle's butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the "dog's tail" and moved it over Danielle's plump body. Her skin was smooth. There were a lot of soft hairs on the dog's tail, as well as soft but hard thorns, which were dense and soft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever the dog's tail brushed across her body, the indescribable itchy feeling stimulated Danielle's nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she knew it, Danielle had been thoroughly developed and trained by him, and she couldn't help but feel strange things that she shouldn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Danielle let out a shameful moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, even though you say no, your body is still very obedient."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling of making a woman submit obediently was exactly what he pursued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, there are still a few hours left. There is plenty of time. We can play slowly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix held the dog's tail and smiled evilly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will have an extra tail on your ass, and then you will realize that you are a real slut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle was already unable to control herself after hearing Felix's insulting words, and now she felt even more ashamed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feelings of humiliation and anger surged in her heart, making her want to kill Felix immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a dog! I'm a human! You're going too far. I will never allow it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle tried to concentrate and resist the unspeakable feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't allow it? It's not up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his tone full of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think about it carefully. These days, every time you started reluctantly, but then you ended up begging me to satisfy you, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give up the resistance. It's useless. Become my woman. There is only one way out. And in the past few days, you have admitted more than once that you are my woman when you climaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just accept everything I arrange for you. I'm doing this for your good. Hehe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's shameless words shocked Danielle's nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! You shut up right there... I didn't agree, I'm not your woman! That... that's because you used despicable means on me, I... I lost my mind..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle blushed as she thought of those disgusting scenes and tried to justify her behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, under the influence of the drug, there was a faint different voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really the case? Did I really... did I really give in because he forced me? But why, why did I feel so good at that time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the thought of shame appeared in Danielle's mind, it was like a spark that could start a prairie fire, making her immersed in fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, in addition to being affected by the effects of the drugs, Danielle was also affected by Felix's hypnotic ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words that Felix said just now planted a psychological anchor in her heart, crushing her remaining will to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danielle felt Felix's hands touching all over her body, and she tried desperately to avoid them, but to no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! I'm not a dog. I'm a human!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was trembling with fear and filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The former mercenary captain, whose hands were stained with the blood of more than a dozen people, was now struggling and shouting. It was all in vain, with no way to escape.</span></p></div>
