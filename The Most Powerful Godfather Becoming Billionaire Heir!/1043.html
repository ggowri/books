        <h1>Chapter 1043 First Kill</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Decker, now furious, pointed at Paula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch! You were just my sex slave. How dare you betray me and even try to kill me? Unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Robinson, look at her! She's a traitor! You can't trust her. If she betrayed me, she'll do the same to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Decker froze, his gaze dropping to the knife embedded in his left chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith sneered, "Did you really think I'd keep you alive? You're getting old, but you're still so naive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Decker crumpled to the ground like a rotting piece of wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened, filled with fury and regret, but he didn't move again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith took a deep breath, suppressing the unease rising in his chest. After all, this was his first time killing someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, Keith calmed himself. He felt everything he did was worth it to complete the mission Alexander had given him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Paula, who had insisted earlier that Decker couldn't be left alive, now trembled in fear as she saw him die. She stepped back several paces, horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith, however, remained composed. His expression was neutral, his face betraying no emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully wiped the fingerprints from his knife and, with practiced calm, lit a pile of books on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the office was engulfed in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All traces of them were destroyed in the blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go," Keith said, pulling Paula out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula didn't even glance at Decker's body. She hurriedly followed Keith out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were far away from the school, they finally heard the distant wail of alarms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Decker's office was completely engulfed in flames, crackling and popping as it burned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Keith had overlooked something. He didn't notice that Decker had installed several cameras, all connected to cloud storage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every piece of footage would be saved on a network drive for a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything that happened in the office had been recorded and uploaded without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at home, Keith immediately plugged the USB drive into his computer and began combing through the files, searching for the name "Cyclops."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, everything was going smoothly, and the task Alexander had given him seemed nearly finished. Keith felt a surge of excitement and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyclops... he's in Lumiria, in Eagle Empire?" Keith murmured in disbelief. "So he's been hiding in Aetheris Street all along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith was both shocked and delighted. He never expected that Hazel had been smuggled abroad by Cyclops. He felt it must have been a covert operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No wonder the Dragon Gang, with all their power in Risun, couldn't find a single lead after so long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, why do you want to find Cyclops?" Paula asked, watching Keith's excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! It's none of your business. Remember your place, and you're just my slave," Keith snapped, squeezing Paula's chest firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Don't be mad. I was wrong. I shouldn't have asked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paula let out a soft moan, her chest aching from his grip, but she didn't mind at all. Instead, she seemed pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knelt beside him, provocatively shaking her hips to tempt Keith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Keith wasn't in the mood for that now. He waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go make me something to eat. I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Master," Paula replied obediently, her tone sweet as she skipped off to the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith snorted. He knew women like her had to be kept in line with strictness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he disciplined her, the more attached she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Keith's face as he sent the files to Alexander and then dialed his number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he waited for the call to connect, a mix of nerves and excitement filled him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had changed his life. To Keith, Alexander was his highest god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keith, what's the urgent matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lazy voice came from the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keith took a deep breath and, brimming with excitement, said, "Mr. Hawthorne, I found Cyclops... he's in Lumiria, hiding in Aetheris Street..."</span></p></div>
