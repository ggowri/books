        <h1>Chapter 569 Straight Flush</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of hesitation and regret flashed in Barry's eyes, but it quickly vanished, replaced by indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Don't worry, I'll win this hand. This is the one that'll decide it all! If I win, I'll get everything back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Diego, get me some more chips. No need to say anything else. I'm not losing this time. Joyce, trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how desperate gamblers were. Even after losing everything, they still clung to the hope of winning it all back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the mind of a gambler, an unbreakable obsession formed, convincing them they always had a chance to turn things around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego's expression showed his discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're saying I can't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint appearing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diego, you're my butler. Your job is to obey me and protect me, not interfere with my decisions. If you have a problem, take it up with the patriarch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Morris, how can you say that? If you keep this up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the severity of Barry's words, Diego sighed deeply, lowering his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family was deeply rooted in hierarchy and rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter his feelings, Diego was Barry's butler, his servant. Until his status changed, he and Joyce had to obey without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce realized there was no changing this outcome, feeling as lifeless as a fish thrown ashore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the surveillance room, Alexander smiled slightly. Barry was as foolish as expected; he'd taken the bait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of indifference, Diego went to exchange for more chips, and the new </span><span>round began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's hand shook as he picked up his cards. He shakily took out a cigarette, lit it, and took a deep drag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips were slightly purple, his face pale, and his eyes bloodshot. His hand trembled uncontrollably as he held his cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to win, more desperately than ever before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had no faith, he silently prayed to any deity he could think of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winning this hand would mean a total comeback!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's luck was incredible this hand. He got four Kings and the Ace of Spades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's excitement grew; not only were his hands shaking, but his whole body began to tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, this hand would be a guaranteed win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's excitement showed in a twisted, triumphant grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was his turn to win. This hand would be his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hand to decide it all&mdash;perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this hand, he could turn everything around and win it all back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Finley and Jaylon, his smile growing wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon's cards showed a straight flush: 9, 10, J, Q.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry sneered. He had all four Kings, while Finley's cards showed three 8s and a 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Jaylon to win, he'd need the last Heart 8. It was a nearly impossible chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, I won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smugly, Barry revealed his hand: four Kings and the Ace of Spades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I've turned it all around in one hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement boiled over, making his whole face flush bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heartbeat was racing, like he'd just sprinted several hundred miles. He was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to win? How could you possibly win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon let out a mocking laugh, then flipped over his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There it was the Heart 8, completing his straight flush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry froze in place, as if he'd been electrocuted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thrilled grin vanished instantly, like he'd been struck over the head. His eyes went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! How could you have that 8? It's not possible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry refused to believe what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he lost all his money, but he'd also lost the woman by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any man, this was a deep humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry couldn't accept this reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon looked at Barry with a satisfied, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry collapsed into his chair like a fish stripped of its bones, his entire spirit crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this isn't right! You two must be cheating. Both of you have been cheating this whole time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego was furious, like an enraged lion, ready to pounce at any moment.</span></p></div>
