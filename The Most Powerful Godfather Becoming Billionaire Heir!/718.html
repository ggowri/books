        <h1>Chapter 718 Dismembered</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after the three had walked far away did Ken finally let out a long breath, quickly wiping away the beads of sweat on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Jane in annoyance. "This is all your fault. You nearly got me killed. Now don't even think about leaving </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane panicked. If they couldn't leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, she and Belinda would eventually get infected and meet a terrible end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ken, please wait..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane tried desperately to reason with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken violently shook off her hand and stormed away, cursing under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one noticed the man in his thirties who started following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore an ugly mask and walked with a pronounced limp, carrying a machete with a sharkskin sheath in his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno hobbled behind Ken, muttering to himself, "Men who bully women deserve to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept whispering while stroking the machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so unremarkable that no one paid him any attention. Even Alexander hadn't noticed his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is truly evil, abandoning his ex-wife like that. Ava must have been deceived by him. Alexander deserves to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry. I'll fulfill your dying wish and restore your honor in the Hawkins </span><span>family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murderous glint flashed in Bruno's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickened his pace and bumped into Ken from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ken heard an ice-cold voice whisper in his ear, "When you get to hell, remember the name Bruno Hawkins. In your next life, don't abuse women! Try being a decent person for once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those </span><span>were</span><span> the last words Ken would ever hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, his body froze, unable to take another step. Then came the excruciating pain, and everything went black...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's body shattered like scattered building blocks. His dismembered remains spread across the ground as blood gushed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh God! Murder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding crowd erupted in terrified screams. No one had any idea what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno's face remained expressionless as he turned and walked in the direction Alexander had gone, his eyes gleaming with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead, Alexander. You don't deserve a perfect woman like Ava!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Alexander had reached the parking lot and was about to get in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stopped and turned toward the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sense a murderous intent. Someone's dead. You two head back first! Make sure Ava and Ashley are safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After instructing the women, Alexander rushed back to the airport entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from hundreds of yards away, the smell of blood hit him like a wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Police tape was already up, with officers holding back the crowd that had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander approached and found the dismembered corpse on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized it immediately as Ken. "How had he ended up dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scanned the area but saw no sign of Jane or Belinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alex!" A familiar, sweet voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Melin. The moment she spotted Alexander, she jogged over excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her police uniform hugged her curves perfectly, drawing appreciative glances from the men around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got transferred here from the hospital. Running into you must be fate!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Melin threw herself into Alexander's arms and planted several quick kisses on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms around her waist, his hands resting on her hips as he chuckled, "Easy there, Ms. Ward. We're in public, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's cheeks flushed as she reluctantly pulled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly changed the subject, gesturing to the body on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's expression immediately turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brow and explained, "We're dealing with a skilled killer. The victim was dismembered in broad daylight, suggesting incredibly fast work. We're currently looking for potential witnesses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Melin pulled Alexander aside, her voice filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come back? This epidemic is terrifying! They're about to lock down the city! And where's your mask? You could get infected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out a mask and tried to put it on him, but he refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, protected by the Force, wasn't worried about any disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked around at the anxious, tense faces surrounding them and said firmly, "I grew up in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>. All my memories are here. I won't leave, and I won't let this place become a ghost town. I'll get to the bottom of this!"</span></p></div>
