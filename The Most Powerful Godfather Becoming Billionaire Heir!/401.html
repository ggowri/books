It's a true feast for the eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mature woman like Mary was indeed experienced; with just a tap, Alexander could signal her to switch positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether riding or kneeling, Mary obeyed him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pure satisfaction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a deep sense of pleasure; being with a sophisticated woman like Mary had a unique appeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I can't take any more..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary collapsed, exhausted, her full chest yielding to gravity, making her look even more enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander wasn't finished; he continued his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a whole hour more, Alexander finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary lay in Alexander's arms, breathless and completely relaxed, like a docile lamb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her rounded hips, and Mary promptly and attentively helped him freshen up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was one of Alexander's most satisfying and gratifying moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching beautiful women submit to him, their sweet tongues and red lips devoutly kissing him, was pure bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of conquest was indescribably wonderful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary lifted her head, looking at Alexander with seductive eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You rascal, go easier on me next time; if this keeps up, you're going to wear me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, don't you enjoy it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned as he placed his hand over her soft curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do, it's just... I'm exhausted and can't keep up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's face flushed bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your body is so alluring, so sexy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, unable to get enough, continued to play with her soft, fair hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you like it, I'll do anything you want. I would never betray you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary held Alexander tightly as if she wanted to melt into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "What's your plan next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of serious matters, Mary grew serious as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Wyatt and Eugene are doomed, the Blood Gang is bound to fall into chaos. This is my chance. I may not be able to control other branches, but I'm confident I can take over the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> branch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent. I'll help with whatever challenges come up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a satisfied smile, feeling his rescue hadn't been in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mary knew what Alexander was thinking, she'd definitely curse this heartless man. She'd given him her body. What more did he want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mary, once you've united the Blood Gang, join my Ultimate Alliance. I promise you won't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander extended an official invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary was shocked and astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the mastermind behind the Ultimate Alliance! I thought it was some mysterious tycoon, but it's you. How are you so capable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was smitten with Alexander. He was impressive both in and out of the bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go; time to head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned as he scooped Mary up and carried her out of the meeting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's face was flushed as she pleaded, "You can't ever leave me. I need you now, and I'll do whatever you want. But... do you think I'm too forward, not a good woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stroked her fair thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men love women to be a bit sexy, but you're not allowed to be with any other man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then from now on, I'll only be sexy for you, your exclusive little vixen, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary's words instantly rekindled Alexander's desire. This woman was truly a seductress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their tongues entwined again, exchanging warmth and passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander carried Mary as he kissed and caressed her, leaving a trail of soft, enticing murmurs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ava was picking up Ashley from school, holding her as she dialed Alexander's number and prepared to get in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye, Ms. Purnell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley waved her chubby little hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella finally snapped out of her daze and forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella watched wistfully until Ava's car disappeared into the distance. Alexander's girlfriend was so beautiful and elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they weren't married yet. Maybe I still had a chance..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ella's face flushed as a flicker of hope rekindled in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to her, a shadowy figure stood not far behind, watching her with a pair of cold, wolf-like eyes.</span></p></div>
