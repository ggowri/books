        <h1>Chapter 283 Cuffed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion saw Schroder leaving and hurried after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General! You promised to support me as the head of the family. You can't just leave </span><span>Loscity</span><span> like this!" Orion called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder only stopped after leaving the Hansen Villa, gritting his teeth as he spoke, "Who said we're leaving </span><span>Loscity</span><span>? I underestimated that kid. I thought I could suppress Alexander, but I didn't expect him to be this strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Orion on the shoulder, letting out a sinister chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Give me a few days to gather my men, and I'll make sure you become the head. Alexander won't have a place to die peacefully!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's excitement returned, and he expressed his gratitude repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jane was absent-minded, her thoughts filled with Alexander's bold display that had sent Schroder packing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cuff them all and take them away. No one is to be released without my orders," Orion commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men in black immediately drew their guns, pointing the dark barrels at the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family was dumbfounded, unable to comprehend why Schroder was doing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane asked anxiously, "General, </span><span>wh</span><span>-what do you mean by this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder grabbed her chin, sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fool. Did you really think I liked you? You were just bait for Alexander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's face turned pale, rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew quickly pleaded, "General, you can't do this to us! We'll help you deal with </span><span>Alexander, no need to lock us up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a pair of shiny silver handcuffs snapped onto his wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew panicked and rushed toward Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder kicked him aside, knocking him to the ground. Andrew clutched his stomach in pain, groaning loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fairfax family members trembled as they were driven away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jane wished she could die. She had thought she had found a powerful ally, only to realize she was nothing more than bait for Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Schroder left, the Hansen family's banquet became lively again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Alexander to force a general to retreat, making everyone even keener to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was full of wealthy and powerful individuals, all crowding around Alexander, flattering him while trying to gain some favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alexander agreed to lower the price of the magic powder just a bit, they could make a lot more profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander had no interest in these hypocrites. He either gave them cold looks or left them for Ava to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lara approached, whispering a few words to Ava, who nodded repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Lara linked her arm with Alexander's and led him inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've spoken to Ava. Please help my grandfather. If he recovers, I'll give up my position as head of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's beautiful face was filled with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Orion had gained the upper hand, most of the Hansen family members treated her with hostility, and Lara found the unfriendly gazes painful to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, sometimes I want to give it all up. I don't want to fight for the head position anymore..." Lara sighed deeply, clutching Alexander's arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gently touched her cheek, comforting her, "Don't worry. I'll do everything I can to help you. The head of the Hansen family will be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them walked closely through a dimly lit corridor and stopped in front of an ornate door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately sensed a few powerful presences hidden in the darkness, all focused on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Hansen family was one of the four great families of </span><span>Loscity</span><span>; they had strong warriors hidden everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man appeared with two men in black, blocking Lara's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara quickly said, "Mateo, this is Alexander. I'm asking him to treat Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mateo looked at Alexander with a blank expression, sizing him up before asking, "Are you the Alexander who invented the magic powder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "Yes, that's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mateo spoke in a cold tone, "Miss, Sir is currently meeting an important guest. It's not </span><span>convenient right now. I suggest you don't go in."</span></p></div>
