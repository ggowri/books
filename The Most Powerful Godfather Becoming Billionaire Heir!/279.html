        <h1>Chapter 279 Meeting Gift</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda clutched her stomach, collapsing to the ground in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped Marvin, who was about to strike again. He stepped toward Amanda, looking down at her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amanda, since you're a woman, I'll give you a chance. If you're willing to be my spy, I'll let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amanda lifted her head, glaring at Alexander with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to betray the General? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and gestured to Marvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin sneered as he grabbed Amanda and dragged her into a nearby thicket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Marvin returned with Amanda's ID badge, along with the badges of four others, completing an elite squad of five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander held the five shiny badges and grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my gift for Schroder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hansen family's banquet, Andrew stood by the entrance, muttering curses against Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Why hasn't that bastard Alexander shown up yet? Did he run away? Damn it, if he dares to run, I'll make his daughter pay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people nearby looked at Andrew with disdain. Alexander's daughter was his own </span><span>granddaughter, and yet he showed no familial loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet had been underway for nearly an hour, yet there was still no sign of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was growing impatient, glancing at the entrance from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane giggled smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, I think Alexander and Ava are too afraid to come. They must be hiding or have already fled </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, gunshots rang out, and Schroder's expression changed instantly. He tried to contact the elite squad, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Amanda isn't responding either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder knew something had gone wrong and grew anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly ordered his men, "Go check on Amanda and the others immediately, and bring Alexander and Ava to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, what's the rush? Did you need me for something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a magnetic male voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Jane heard the familiar voice, she trembled and instinctively stepped away from Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her emotions were complicated; she both hated Alexander and deeply regretted her choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, it was Alexander, walking in with his arm around Ava's waist, smiling brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked dashing, and Ava was stunningly elegant, drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He met Schroder's fierce gaze without fear, walking over with a confident, dazzling smile that captivated everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following behind Alexander were Augusta, Marvin, William, and Charlize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four wore expressionless faces, their cold eyes fixed on Schroder. Their synchronized steps radiated a sharp killing intent, like blades and swords combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clatter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander tossed Amanda and the others' ID badges at Schroder's feet, smiling as he said, "General, I ran into some bandits on the way here, so I'm a bit late. Hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his mistress Amanda's badge, Schroder's eye twitched uncontrollably as he growled, "Alexander, you dared to mess with my woman? Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, do those bandits have something to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder was stunned, unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His secret deployment of special forces to ambush Alexander couldn't be exposed, or he'd face severe consequences back at the headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, everyone watching in stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected Alexander to immediately deliver a blow to Schroder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder, who had been so commanding just moments ago, suddenly seemed helpless in front of Alexander, unsure how to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Jane's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled how Ryan, Sebastian, and others who had been high and mighty, were all trampled under Alexander's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that even Schroder can't handle Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's heart was filled with deep fear and regret. Was her original choice really wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Andrew was the first to jump up, pointing at Alexander and cursing, "Alexander, how can you speak like that? Apologize to the General immediately!"</span></p></div>
