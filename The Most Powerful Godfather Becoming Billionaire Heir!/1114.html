        <h1>Chapter 1114 Infected One</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next to the innermost stall, there was a small vent in the wall, barely the size of two palms. The fan had fallen to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did they escape through here!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin stared at the tiny vent, her expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had seen the attacker's hand, but what kind of person could slip through such a narrow vent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was half an hour later when Alexander arrived at the police station to meet Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was clearly shaken, looking even more exhausted than before. Her once-beautiful face was pale, and her lips, which had been a healthy pink, now lacked any color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was alright. When she saw Alexander, her expression changed from shock to relief, and then she noticed Oliver following behind him. A helpless smile crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected Oliver to bring Alexander directly, but in this situation, she really couldn't handle the problem alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just thinking about the assassination attempt in the restroom sent chills down her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Benton, I'd like to speak to Melin alone. Is that alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, turning to Oliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, go ahead. I have other things to take care of. I'll head out first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver replied with a smile, quickly turning and walking out. He even closed the door behind him as he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Oliver was gone, Melin suddenly threw herself into Alexander's arms and began to tell him everything strange that had been happening lately, including the attack she had just faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alexander, who's trying to harm me? But I can't figure out why..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin looked at Alexander with wide, anxious eyes, her fear evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're still dreaming about the living dead? And someone's been trying to kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pondered for a moment and then began to use the Force, carefully examining Melin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long before he noticed something unusual. There was a dark energy within her, identical to the one he had felt in Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin had been poisoned!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the poison was still in its early stages, so besides feeling mentally drained and physically weak, there was no immediate life-threatening danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint flashing in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Yinson behind this. You've been poisoned, or rather, infected by the Immortality Serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The assassin was probably also from the Sakra Society. They're seeking revenge. You were the one who first discovered the living dead outside Loscity, and you led the military to eliminate them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah! What do I do now? Am I going to turn into a living dead...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin trembled, her fear sending shivers down her spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. You've only been infected for a short time. I can completely eliminate the toxins from your body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander pulled Melin onto the bed and began to use the Force to massage her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin immediately felt a surge of intense energy flowing through her, and the soreness and weakness she had been feeling began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alexander continued to channel the Force, beads of black sweat started to surface on Melin's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black sweat carried a foul odor, and not only did it stain Melin's clothes, but it also spread throughout the entire room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander didn't stop, continuing the treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until Melin went from feeling weak and exhausted to being full of energy, and the black sweat finally stopped emerging, that he let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's so disgusting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin took the initiative to strip off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's heart raced as he admired her full, curvy figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reached out and placed his hand on her soft hips, giving them a playful slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of a sharp slap echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her soft, round bottom jiggled, tender and bouncy, smooth as silk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't resist and gave it a hard squeeze, his fingers sinking deeply into the soft, pale butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin moaned in pleasure with an electrifying sensation that left her weak and breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Alexander lifted Melin's beautiful legs and folded them against his chest, and then pressed himself down on her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin was instantly overwhelmed by a wave of pure joy, and the discomfort she had felt before completely vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if she had become an instrument, and Alexander was the master musician, free to play her, touch her, and make music as he pleased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah... so you're the miracle I've been looking for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Melin trembled all over, playfully pouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled, a mischievous glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body, as ripe and soft as a peach, was completely under his control. She was writhing like the most agile fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The non-stop moans were the greatest encouragement to him, urging him to press forward with even more intensity.</span></p></div>
