        <h1>Chapter 853 No Way to Win</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only four people in the VIP room, Alexander, Marvin standing behind him, Benjamin, and the beautiful dealer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first card was dealt to Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He extended his right hand, gently covering the card without lifting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Benjamin already knew what his card was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint flush appeared on his previously tense face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the dealer's shuffle, he had memorized every card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every gambling expert possessed an extraordinary memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They used the tiniest imperfections on the cards to tell them apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin had been studying gambling since he was four; now, it had been sixty years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He considered himself the king of the casino, capable of switching cards at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So skillful that even slow-motion surveillance footage couldn't catch his tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander, however, didn't touch his card; his X-ray vision allowed him to see it clearly without any effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Benjamin's prized card-switching technique, Alexander found it laughably slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly. Too bad&mdash;even with Benjamin's skill, he stood no chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alexander entered, he had already used Force Control on Benjamin, impacting his mental state without him even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whatever Benjamin saw or touched was just an illusion Alexander had implanted in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Benjamin was completely fooled by the illusion, a state worse than being blind or deaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was merely putting on a show, playing just to impress Norma. Winning was always within his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was also watching Norma's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to see if she would be worth investing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Alexander wouldn't hesitate to take control of Sean and let him run the Dragon Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm all in!" Alexander declared confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander tilted his head, looking at Benjamin with an air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! You fool, do you even know how to play? You're going all in after just one card?" Benjamin laughed, clutching his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the surveillance room, someone yelled angrily, "Boss, is this Alexander guy messing around? You gave him a billion in chips, and he's going all in right away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the other three gambling experts chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, this bet is way too risky; he's bound to lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he working with Benjamin? Why else would he go all in with a billion at the start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Benjamin is the king of gambling; he'll definitely call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's strategy was unexpected. Was he setting her up for failure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Benjamin has never lost, and we've already suffered heavy losses. We can't afford to lose again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boss, let me bring him back. Stop him from playing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is planned; that guy has bad intentions..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chatter in the once-quiet surveillance room grew louder, turning it into a noisy marketplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up, all of you!" Norma shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Norma's angry outburst silenced the room instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She still believed Alexander had a reason for his actions and wasn't doing it on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone talks nonsense without proof again, I'll kill them myself." Norma's voice dripped with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her threat silenced everyone completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the table, Alexander pushed the billion in chips to the center and looked at the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Add four billion more! Bring it now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The commanding tone left Benjamin stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, several staff members brought over a large case of chips, stacking it in the center of the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The neatly arranged, imposing stack of chips made an impressive sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All in. Bet everything you have! Do you dare to call?" Alexander taunted Benjamin with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled provocatively at Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Benjamin pushed all his wealth into the pot&mdash;five billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten-billion-dollar pot stunned the dealer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a seasoned VIP dealer who had seen countless games but had never encountered stakes this high.</span></p></div>
