        <h1>Chapter 627 Killer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am SATAN, the Godfather of Mafia. Do I need you to teach me what to do?" Brandon roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karl was so frightened that he dared not speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Brandon said, "Tell Bruno that no matter what means he uses, as long as he can kill Alexander, he will be a member of the Hawkins family. I will let him enter the upper echelons of Mafia and become one of the successor candidates."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Godfather. Please calm down. I will do it right away." Karl agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about meeting Bruno, Karl felt a chill on his back, and his whole body stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kamdon, known as the evil place, was one of the most chaotic cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground forces here were complicated. The most powerful group among them was the Redoom Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Redoom Group was full of elites, and the boss was a king-level mercenary. He was so powerful that no one dared to mess with him in Kamdon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, someone broke into the Redoom Group alone today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a devil. Inside the Redoom Group headquarters, blood flowed everywhere, and corpses lay all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodies in the pool of blood were not complete. They were chopped into many pieces, with broken limbs and arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to have seen something horrifying before they died. Their eyes were wide open, and their expressions were ferocious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with a strong smell of blood, and every corner made people want to vomit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of members of the Redoom Group had been killed. Only the leader Francisco Muda and a dozen injured elites of the group were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francisco was a king-level mercenary with top swordsmanship, and the remaining subordinates were also good fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had pale faces and stared fiercely at the figure in front of them with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was about thirty years old, wearing an ugly mask. Holding a bloody black machete in his hand, he slowly approached with his limp foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like the killer in a horror movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in front of him were the only ones left in Redoom Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruno, we have never offended you. Why are you helping Mafia to kill us? Don't you have a grudge against Brandon?" Francisco asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon didn't accept Bruno, and every member of the Hawkins family treated Bruno as a bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fulfill his mother's last wish and to have his mother buried in the family cemetery, Bruno was willing to be a killer of the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno had a disfigured face and was a cripple. He was disabled, but he was an extraordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who didn't know him couldn't associate him with genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what Francisco said, Bruno replied coldly, "Stop talking nonsense. Just surrender, and I can let you die with less pain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was very overbearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francisco's face was pale, and his eyes were full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruno, I admit that you are the most powerful killer. But you must pay a heavy price for killing us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francisco suddenly took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squatted down and exerted force. The hard floor exploded like a large spider web crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francisco rushed towards Bruno like a cannonball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed a king-level mercenary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruno remained expressionless, facing such a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Francisco swung his machete, the sharp blade was almost reaching Bruno's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce light in Bruno's eyes, he dodged the attack by moving sideways and drew his machete at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade flashed across Francisco's body, and it was too late for him to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream, Francisco's right arm flew out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed out, flowing all over the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Francisco could come to his senses, the machete flashed again, and a bloody mark appeared on his throat.</span></p></div>
