        <h1>Chapter 1402 Bloody Battle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Galo was shocked. His fat face twitched, and his four toad-like eyes bulged. He shouted, "Fog Trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A churning mass of black fog appeared and instantly engulfed Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought, "I can't move again! I bear the attack, but I still couldn't kill Galo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was livid. A surge of blue protective energy filled his body, yet he still couldn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Go to hell!" Galo laughed smugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fat face was full of ferocity. He raised his arms, and several spears and sabers on the ground levitated. With a fierce wave of his hands, they shot towards Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extremely dangerous situation. At this critical moment, a burning heat flared in his left chest. A mysterious and scorching warmth instantly spread his body, and he could finally move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes. A dazzling bright-white flame suddenly spurted from his feet. His movement was as fast as a shooting star. In an instant, he approached Galo. The Black Iron Ring on Alexander's right middle finger shone with a dazzling golden light. Dragon roars sounded, and tiny mysterious runes on the ring lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Galo's horrified gaze, Alexander punched Galo's head. With a dull sound, blood burst into the air. Galo's big head was blasted into pieces. His fat body was still trembling and twitching in mid-air. Then, it fell to the ground, raising a cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Galo, a member of Hell Force, was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's that internal energy." Frieza pressed the combat-power detector on his left eye. "The young man's combat power suddenly burst out, soaring from 3,600 to 12,000. He is an expert in Divine Transformation State! Galo, you are really good for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce light flickered in Frieza's strange eyes. Flames shot out from his feet. A dazzling scarlet-flame air-wave enveloped his short figure, and he rushed towards the Hrodvik camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a long sigh of relief, stroked the Black Iron Ring, and thought, "Fortunately, I have learned how to accelerate the Energy Plot Attack. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy to get close to Galo. This ring is a treasure! Besides delivering powerful blows, it seems to be able to break anything easily. Misael and Galo are level-five warriors. As long as they were hit in a vital spot, they would be killed easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?" Alexander murmured and looked at a small round iron cylinder beside Galo's body. It was about an inch long and as thick as a plate. Presumably, it had rolled out from Galo's body. Alexander picked it up and weighed it in his hand. It was a bit heavy. He was just about to open it and take a look when he sensed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That extremely powerful internal energy is approaching!" Alexander threw the iron cylinder into his Space Bag and turned around, staring in the direction of Hero Gorge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the camp wall, the fierce battle was in full swing. Blood flowed like a river both on and under the wall. The corpses of the Risunese had piled up, and the Risunese no longer needed scaling ladders. They climbed up the wall by stepping on the corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain of arrows had long since become sparse. Logs, boulders, and boiling feces-oil mixture had all been used up. The Hrodvik army and the Risunese were engaged in fierce combat with their swords and spears, neither side giving in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin's arms had long been numb. Constant stringing of the bow had injured his muscles. The arrows had also been used up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a spear and stood on the wall. An arrow from a Risunese was stuck in his right shoulder, and blood had stained his right chest. Fortunately, due to the fine leather armor, the arrowhead didn't penetrate deep into his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were fewer and fewer comrades around Rankin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin couldn't help but glance at Gunner on the ground. Gunner's whole body was covered in blood, his eyes wide open, and the scar on his face looked even more ferocious. He was tightly entangled with two Risunese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sward in Gunner's right hand had pierced through the chest of a Risunese, and his left hand tightly gripped the neck of another Risunese. The two Risunese's sabers had stabbed into Gunner's abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear in Rankin's hand belonged to Rey. Rey had always said that he wanted to go back to Darwin early to see his wife and son. He had just fallen off the wall with two Risunese. Rankin didn't know if Rey was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the huge camp wall, only the dull sound of swords and spears piercing into bodies and the shrill screams of the Risunese could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rankin mechanically hacked and stabbed the Risunese. From time to time, his comrades would die. The blood flowed like a stream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a short and strange figure arrived above Alexander's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man wore a spiked helmet, with two ferocious spikes on both sides. He had a square face, large triangular eyes, and small pupils. His hands were like ape claws. He wore brass boots and striped armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming chill enveloped Alexander, and a cold and deathly aura spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander thought, "This strange man is probably Frieza Mank, the character in "Dragon Ball", but he doesn't have a tail and chicken claws."</span></p></div>
