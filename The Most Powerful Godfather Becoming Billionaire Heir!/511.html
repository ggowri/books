        <h1>Chapter 511 Greed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Barry, the Red Umbrella Group had no other Level 3 metahumans, while Francis' personal bodyguard was a Level 3 metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the military, the Red Umbrella Group's power was definitely lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and the strikingly beautiful Juliet stormed in with a group of people in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group was heavily armed, with two Level 2 metahumans among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of people charged in, surrounding Felix and glaring at him with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder the </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span> was such a critical zone; the number and strength of metahumans were staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, shall we finish him off?" Juliet asked, glaring at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, I was in the wrong. I'm willing to pay you five hundred million in compensation and sincerely apologize! I want to take down Alexander; he's our common enemy!" Felix pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix looked pitiful as he begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mighty chairman of the Red Umbrella Group had now been reduced to pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is all because of that scoundrel Alexander," Felix thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deadly silence filled the room. Francis said nothing, and everyone stared menacingly at Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's back was drenched in sweat; he was as meek as a frightened chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a tense minute or two, Francis' expression finally softened, and he spoke coldly. "What's your plan? If I send troops to protect your people, how exactly do you intend to deal with Alexander? I'm not one to be easily fooled, so don't try to scam me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd never deceive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix exhaled deeply, wiping the sweat from his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing a smile, he asked, "Mr. Wallace, have you heard of the Morris Family Army?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Francis' eyes narrowed with a hint of interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean the Morris Family Army that dominates the northern wilderness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris Family Army was renowned, filled with experts and deeply rooted strength across the wildlands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix replied excitedly, "Exactly! Barry, a direct member of the Morris family, joined our Red Umbrella Group and, under my guidance, became a Level 3 metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry's son, Raven, was killed by Alexander. Barry's determined to get revenge! I can bring the Morris family on board. Alexander won't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Morris family may be powerful, but they're not fools. Barry might want revenge on Alexander, but he's not the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without substantial benefits, the Morris family won't step up on your behalf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet and the others scoffed at Felix's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morris family wielded such power that even the military showed them respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix smiled smugly, unbothered by Francis and the others' mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know the Morris family won't help me easily, but a hundred years ago, the Vanderbilt family saved their ancestors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not for the Vanderbilt family, the Morris family would have been wiped out. That's why Barry joined the group to support me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm prepared to offer the Morris family a portion of the company's shares for their support. They surely won't refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the magic powder is so popular. If we get the formula from Alexander, the profits will be astronomical!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix spoke passionately, and even Francis' expression showed excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared intently at Felix, his eyes brimming with unhidden greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix, if you're willing to give up shares to get the Morris family's help, why should I send troops to protect your people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix's eye twitched, fury burning within him, though he kept his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, if you back me, I'll transfer five percent of Red Umbrella Group's shares to you personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five percent? At Red Umbrella Group's hundred-billion-dollar valuation, that's five billion, with a few hundred million in annual dividends..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis swallowed hard, doing the math in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he nodded slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Give me ten percent of the shares, and I'll agree to help you through this crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was so angry he almost slapped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the partnership with the military, they controlled sixty percent of Red Umbrella Group's shares, leaving him with only forty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis was exploiting the situation, asking for ten percent upfront. How greedy could he get?</span></p></div>
