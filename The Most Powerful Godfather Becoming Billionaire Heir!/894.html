        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would completely conquer Vivian mentally and physically and let her go back undercover so that he could gain access to the intelligence of the entire Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Except Vivian, no one else will be left alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the order, Alexander left with Vivian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marvin and Shadow went on a killing spree, and one Mafia member after another fell into a pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hotel room,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, looking at Vivian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian stood there obediently, trembling slightly, not daring to look at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!" Alexander ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian didn't dare to resist and moved closer to Alexander reluctantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly hugged her in his arms, kissed her, squeezed his tongue between her red lips, and greedily sucked on Vivian's sweet tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kissing her for a while, Alexander let her go and asked curiously, "You have a very special scent. What perfume do you use?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian blushed and replied, "This is a special perfume from </span><span>Soutaxia</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander buried his head in her cleavage and took a sniff. It smelled terrific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, how old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I just turned twenty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian answered stutteringly, turning her head away and avoiding Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched her chin, turned her to look at him, and said with a smile, "You're twenty years old and still a virgin. Haven't you found a suitable man in the Mafia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's heartbeat quickened, and she blushed and whispered, "I don't like men... </span><span>So</span><span> it's useless even if you bully me. I won't like you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing and scratched the tip of her nose with his finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because you haven't tasted a real man yet. I'll let you know what a real man is, and you'll definitely be fascinated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored Vivian's pitiful appearance and pressed her down directly. He sealed her lips, put his tongue in again, stirred her tender tongue violently, and licked every corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian didn't dare to resist because she was controlled and affected by the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were another man, this ruthless beauty snake would immediately bear her fangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pushed Vivian down on the sofa, knelt on her waist, took off her top, and then tore Vivian's clothes off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her buttons flew off, revealing her plump breasts wrapped in a large-size bra made of transparent tulle and lace. Two small red nipples could be vaguely seen hidden inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian screamed and quickly crossed her arms over her chest, trying to block Alexander's sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I am your master. You cannot refuse my orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and took off her bra, and her seductive breasts immediately jumped out, trembling, making him excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Vivian was left with only a pair of black lace panties, with a small piece of fabric blocking the front and two thin strings extending from her hips to her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander lifted her buttocks and saw that a thin strip of cloth was tied in the buttock groove, and the two buttocks were utterly exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was forced to kneel on the sofa with her butt sticking up and her back facing Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander caressed her round and plump buttocks and patrolled her charming secret part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was lying on her stomach with her pretty face flushed. Opening her eyes, she saw the man's terrifying penis right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's caress, Vivian also became aroused. Coupled with the anchor that Alexander had planted in her spiritual consciousness, she could no longer control herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian reached out and held his penis, then stretched out her rosy tongue and licked it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mix of sweat and fishiness filled her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Vivian almost vomited it out, but after swallowing it a few times, she suddenly fell in love with this feeling. She felt hot all over and wanted to swallow the whole thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted her butt and said with a smile, "How is it? A man is better, right? Don't worry. This is just the beginning. I will definitely show you how good a man is and get you back on track."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian was so embarrassed and annoyed that she almost cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander would not let her go, and he simply swung his waist and hips to move his penis quickly while kneading and playing in her beautiful secret garden.</span></p></div>
