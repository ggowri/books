        <h1>Chapter 59 The Humiliation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave Oscar a cold look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, are you threatening me? What I hate most is being threatened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is not a hospital, and I'm not a doctor. Isn't your grandson a doctor of medicine? Let him cure you. My daughter is much more important than you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he spoke, Alexander took Ava's hand and led her into the house, closing the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava smiled and touched Alexander's hand, asking him to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar said furiously, "Brat, did you poison me? That's why you knew I would fall ill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Kaylon instantly rushed forward and stared at Alexander murderously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tell us. How could you have predicted all this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart is a senior member of the Kaylon. Do you know what will happen if you refuse us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander found these people really arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you came, you banged the door and threatened me, and now you are slinging mud at me. Are you really seeking my help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I warned him with good intentions that he would suffer from Parkinson's disease, but he didn't believe me, and now he's trying to turn the tables on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to help you. Get lost."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Kaylon were furious and rushed forward to capture Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you dare to attack me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grew angry. He protected Ava with his left hand and punched the face of the first sturdy man who rushed up with his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sturdy man screamed in pain and was sent flying, knocking off two of his companions. The three of them rolled away on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying force stunned everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They stared at Alexander like a group of hyenas facing the lion king who was slaughtering them. Although they were angry, they did not dare to take a step forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the Kaylon so great? Go back and improve your manners. When you ask for help, you have to be polite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander spoke, he pulled Ava into the house and slammed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dead silence fell upon everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all felt deeply humiliated, angry, and helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Ava opened the door again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled and said, "Sir Stewart, you should ask for help in the right way. My boyfriend hates to be threatened. If you think you're superior and try to threaten him or slander him, I will not help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar turned pale and sighed deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it. Forget it. One has to bow his head when seeking help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava said, "I have talked to my boyfriend. As long as you are sincere and don't put on airs, he will help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm warning you, if anyone dares to disrespect my boyfriend again, the Saint Group will make you regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've done my best to help you. Sir Stewart, good luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Ava spoke, she went away. It was obvious that she didn't want to care about this anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar's face went grave, and he shook violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent looked at Ava's beautiful figure with obsession, feeling jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Alexander win the heart of Ava?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from the Kaylon wanted to knock on the door again, but Oscar stopped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stay here quietly. We'll wait for Alexander to come out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time crawled, and they had been waiting at the door for almost two hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was midsummer, and everyone was sweating profusely, even their clothes were wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar felt dizzier. He felt that he would die if he kept waiting like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door finally opened again. Alexander came out carrying a thermos box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was chicken soup and spaghetti in the box. His daughter could only eat this kind of food after the surgery. He was very thoughtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haven't you left yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander glanced at them indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar wore a hopeful expression and said awkwardly, "Mr. Hawthorne, I was being rude just now. I'd like to make a sincere apology to you. I hope you can forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was quiet, and the people from the Kaylon said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was obvious from their expressions and eyes that they felt deeply humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oscar pleaded with a trembling voice, "Mr. Hawthorne, please give me the treatment. I don't want to suffer from Parkinson's disease... Please help me for the sake of the alliance between the Kaylon and the Saint Group and Ms. Blackburn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was not only making chicken soup for his daughter just now but also trying to teach the old man a lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed that Oscar wouldn't put on a condescending look from now on and attached more importance to the alliance with the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sir Stewart, I can help you recover temporarily, but if you want to be completely cured, you need to come to me for treatment once a month for at least a year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's words made Sir Stewart ecstatic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent pursed his lips with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knows if it's true? If you have the ability, cure my grandpa now."</p></div>
