        <h1>Chapter 942 Someone's Coming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave her round ass another hard slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe whimpered softly, throwing Alexander a slightly pouty look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander knew she was just putting on an act&mdash;deep down, she loved every second of the rough treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe turned sideways without hesitation, placing her hands on the toilet lid, ready to pull down her thong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped her right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to take it off. I'll just move it to the side. Makes it more exciting. And when I'm done inside you, no cleaning up. You go right back to work, being the perfect CEO."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you sure? What if it leaks out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's face flushed with genuine embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop stalling and get in position. If the auction starts and I haven't had my fun, don't blame me if I make you finish in front of everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice was full of taunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she was just in a really wild mood today, or maybe Alexander's darker side was starting to take over, letting his deepest desires out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't realize it, but if he kept this up, he might end up pushing himself into a Corrupted Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe was visibly aroused by his words, her seductive gaze mixing with a hint of shame, her body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, my ass is up. You can move my panties and give me what I deserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've missed you so much. The moment I saw you, I was already soaked. I love it </span><span>when you touch me, when you grab me. I want you to take me until I can't take any more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe shook her round, firm ass, her slender waist making her curves look even more defined, her thong tight between her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't waste a second. He grabbed the thin strap of her thong and pulled it aside, pressing it against her sensitive spot, making Cloe whimper softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already dripping, the evidence right there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his body against her soft butt&mdash;her skin was so </span><span>hot,</span><span> it was clear how worked up she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander teased her, getting close but not giving in, Cloe got even more desperate, moving her hips, trying to rub against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir... please, I can't take it anymore... I'm begging you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced back at him, her eyes full of longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander finally found the right spot and thrust forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's entire body went stiff as she tried to adjust to the sudden fullness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt an indescribable rush, the heat, the tightness, the way her body squeezed around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, gripping her soft, round hips, his fingers digging in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning in, Alexander kissed her neck while holding her tight, moving with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe could barely handle the intensity, her body reacting to every single thrust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she bit her lip, soft moans kept slipping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked, whispering, "You better keep it down, or someone might hear us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's entire body shivered in embarrassment, the pleasure only growing stronger, flooding through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit down harder on her lip, forcing herself to stay quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was teasing her on purpose. With his heightened senses, he knew if anyone was even close to the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack! Smack! Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of Alexander's body hitting Cloe's ass echoed, mixed with the slick, wet noises, making it all even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alexander heard footsteps approaching in the hallway, getting closer to the women's restroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander whispered, slowing down his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe's eyes widened with panic, her body tensing up instantly, squeezing him even tighter. The sudden tightness made Alexander groan with pleasure.</span></p></div>
