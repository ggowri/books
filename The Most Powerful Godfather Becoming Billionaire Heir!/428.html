        <h1>Chapter 428 Kidnapping Attempt</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blade felt bone-chillingly cold as Andrew trembled like a frightened rabbit in the snow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Felix from the Red Umbrella Group. He... he signed a contract with us to have Ashley participate in their research project... it's just a research project!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew, fearing that Alexander wouldn't believe him, began to swear fervently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened as he pressed on. "What research project?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Genetics... a genetics research project... ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Andrew could finish, Alexander kicked him hard in the stomach, causing him to curl up like a shrimp, convulsing on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is Felix?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pressed his foot against Andrew's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew's face turned pale as he stammered, "I don't know, I truly don't know! Alexander, you... you can't treat me like this... I was your father-in-law..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander delivered another kick to his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Andrew felt the pain surge through him like bile rising from his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for your blood relation to Ashley, you'd already be dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's deep eyes glimmered with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But while you can escape a death sentence, a living punishment is unavoidable. Since you sneaked in here, I'll treat you like a kidnapper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gestured to Rosalia, signaling her to deal with Andrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Rosalia drew her katana, holding it with both hands and mimicking a slashing motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew nearly wet himself, pleading desperately. "No! Please don't kill me! I'm begging you... think of Ashley..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia let out a tinkling laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master said he won't kill you, so I won't. But to think you would kidnap your own granddaughter&mdash;you're even lower than an animal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the blade flashed twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood marks appeared on Andrew's wrists and ankles as the sharp edge bit into his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the blood began to seep out that Andrew truly felt the excruciating pain and opened his mouth to wail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia stuffed a filthy sock into his mouth to silence him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wah! Alex...</span><span>ander</span><span>, you... bastard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew struggled and thrashed desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cuts Rosalia made had severed the tendons in his hands and feet, rendering him helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police, let them handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he headed straight for his study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now filled with the Force at its peak, Alexander was eager to try carving out one hundred and eight </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, master..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia watched Alexander disappear, running her tongue across her painted lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd had him right where she wanted him, until this old man showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, she turned her anger on Andrew, drawing a dagger and making a shallow cut on her own arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the wound - just enough to make her point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew froze, watching the beautiful woman with growing dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Breaking in, assault with a weapon... that's what, twenty or thirty years in prison? You'll be celebrating your retirement behind bars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made Andrew's blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>.....</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the study, Alexander wasted no time. He took out a carving knife and pulled out a piece of exquisite gemstone to start carving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To complete the magic circle, he had to carve out one hundred and eight </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, he was just three Patterns away from success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His knife danced across the stone, and in no time, dozens of intricate and profound </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns appeared on the gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed no signs of slackening, taking a deep breath as he quickened his pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he had carved out one hundred Patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last eight Patterns consumed more and more of the Force, each becoming increasingly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred and two... three, four, five..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he returned to the spot where he had previously failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alexander felt a bit fatigued, but the Force still surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled all his Force, and suddenly, his blood rushed like a tidal wave, propelling his spirit to an unprecedented peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind cleared, and all fatigue vanished in an instant.</span></p></div>
