        <h1>Chapter 51 Shameless</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda glanced around nervously as she muttered under her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava's got a mansion here in Bevery Hills, just up ahead. You ran into Alexander here before. They must be shacking up together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt a pang of jealousy, her stomach churning unpleasantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and Ryan had come house hunting in Bevery Hills not long ago. Once Ryan became VP at Saint Group, they'd finally have the means to live here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then Alexander crippled Ryan that day, leaving their situation more hopeless than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey! Isn't that Alexander?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda pointed ahead, her voice filled with surprise and delight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane spotted Alexander, too, and a whirlwind of emotions swept through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had dressed with particular care today, donning a provocative, ultra-short skirt with no underwear, her ample bosom tightly encased and dramatically outlined, creating an enticing cleavage that was hard to ignore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked, her unrestrained breasts swayed enticingly, drawing eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Below the short skirt, her long legs were clad in black, thigh-high fishnet stockings, the delicate mesh accentuating her skin, compelling Billy and others to swallow hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no denying that Jane had her charms, with an attractive figure to boot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Alexander remained unimpressed, his heart untouched. Having seen beauties like Ava and Betty, Jane seemed a notch below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, there you are, Alex!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda greeted Alexander effusively, her eyes greedily taking in the grandeur of his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave Belinda a frosty look, harboring no fondness for her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda always looked down on him, constantly criticizing him as a worthless freeloader who wasn't a real man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane and I are divorced. I'm not your family anymore," Alexander said, his tone as cold as Arctic ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda let out an awkward chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, come on, Alexander. Don't be like that. We've been family for five years. That kind of bond can't be broken so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt a wave of nausea looking at her despicable face, plastered with a fake smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Alexander ignore her, Belinda quickly nudged Jane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane felt embarrassed but spoke up softly anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, I know I messed up. But I still love you. We were together for five years, and we have our daughter, Ashley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ashley would want us to be together, wouldn't she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She cleverly played the emotional card, knowing Alexander's love for their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander scoffed at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have the nerve to bring up our daughter? You were ready to abandon her just to be with Ryan. You don't deserve to be Ashley's mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane brazenly said, "Alexander, I never actually betrayed you. My flirtation with Ryan was just to motivate you to work harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Think about it. Without my push, could you have achieved what you have now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander was dumbfounded. This woman's shamelessness knew no bounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Belinda, noticing Alexander's silence, mistook it for interest. She grew excited and pressed on with even more enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Listen, Alexander. Jane's willing to patch things up with you. But don't worry, we won't get in the way of you and Ms. Blackburn at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We have just one condition. Could you use the Saint Group's influence to secure a foothold for the Fairfax family in Loscity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jane will be at your beck and call, ready to obey you unconditionally. We'll always consider you our closest family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Belinda gave Jane a little push.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't just stand there like a dummy. Go on, kiss your husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander felt utterly disgusted, and even Billy and the others were nauseated. They'd never seen someone so shameless before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jane batted her eyelashes and flipped her hair flirtatiously, then strolled towards Alexander with a provocative swing of her hips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Baby, I'm all yours whenever you want me. Remember how you wanted to see me in that sexy lingerie? I brought it with me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She purred, throwing herself at Alexander's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Alexander dodged her with lightning speed. Jane hadn't expected him to move so fast, thinking he'd catch her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hit the ground hard, tumbling down the steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander couldn't help but burst into laughter, with Billy and the others joining in the loud chorus.</p></div>
