        <h1>Chapter 512 Shares</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix said with a gloomy face, "Mr. Wallace, the shares I give you are the same as those I gave to the Morris family, both 5%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't lend a helping hand, once the Red Umbrella Group collapses, it will affect the military's plan to train metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The military is the largest shareholder of the group. When the time comes, I'm afraid you will be punished..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis stared at Felix fiercely without saying a word, obviously calculating the gains and losses in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Then, let's go with five percent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis finally relented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Felix was indignant after the shares were given, he felt much more relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, rest assured. I will complete the equity transfer procedures today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, pushed Juliet and the guard man away, and strode outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet, who had a hot temper, was so angry that she was about to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis stopped her immediately, and then waved his hand. "Send someone to escort him properly. Felix is still very courageous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix had a gloomy face and left the room without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he can decide on the shares of the Red Umbrella Group, his father will definitely not let him go once he gets to know about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Since you side with Alexander, don't blame me for using any means necessary. You forced me to do this. I will send all of you to hell, and everything will be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix cursed with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wallace, are we really going to send troops?" Juliet asked, unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis slapped the table hard, leaving a clear five-fingerprint on the solid wood tabletop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when can even you question my decision?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis signaled the guard man to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man lowered his head and retreated respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a level-three metahuman and could do whatever he wanted outside, he was trained by the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Francis, a four-star general, he had no choice but to obey, otherwise even his family would be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis ordered Juliet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet walked up to Francis tremblingly. Although she was a colonel and a goddess in the eyes of many soldiers, she had been trained to the point of losing her self-esteem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis grabbed her hair and forced her to kneel on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move, kneel down for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis needed to vent now, and he had no intention of showing any mercy to women, and his actions were extremely rude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah...ah...be gentle, I can't bear it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet uttered a series of pleas through her clenched teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't stand this? It hasn't even really started yet. Who asked you to question my decision in public? This is the punishment you deserve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis tore off Juliet's military uniform and pulled her skirt to her ankles, causing her plump round buttocks to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the snow-white butt and took a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! I want to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet grabbed Francis' head and pressed it against her buttocks. She didn't know why she was so excited, maybe because Francis was rough enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also many soldiers standing outside and they could hear what was happening inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis pressed Juliet on the table and pulled down her thong. Surprisingly, her clothes were completely naked, and it was obvious that she had been shaved with a razor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, did you shave it last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet shivered and rubbed her breasts with her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis couldn't bear it any longer and pressed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet made a sound that was not sure whether it was joy or sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she tried her best to control her moans, they still spread from the room to the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the room and the corridor were filled with Juliet's singing, whether it was happy or painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard man looked at the soldiers around him, and each of them had an evil smile and an envious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Juliet was the unattainable goddess in their minds, but they didn't expect Francis to play her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Francis was a general!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix returned to the Red Umbrella Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vanderbilt, I have prepared all the equity transfer information you requested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female secretary handed over the documents with both hands, hesitated for a moment and asked, "Mr. Vanderbilt, the special forces are ready. Should we call them </span><span>in?"</span></p></div>
