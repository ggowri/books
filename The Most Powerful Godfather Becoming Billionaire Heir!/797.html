        <h1>Chapter 797 Late Night Attack</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, Alexander, how dare you threaten me? It is the first time I've met someone who dares to threaten me. Let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora finished her words and waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take him, and let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They drove away in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Todd and the others came in a threatening manner and ran away in disgrace, and everyone present burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A murderous intent appeared in Alexander's deep eyes, and he muttered to himself, "If you dare, take my counterattack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Late at night, there was not a single car or ghost on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people had fallen into a deep sleep. There was not even the sound of birds singing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only a few wild cats and dogs that came from nowhere, fighting and chasing each other on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The occasional sounds of cats and dogs barking further highlighted the coldness and silence of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>About 1,000 feet away from the Ultimate Alliance's production base, more than twenty men in black, fully armed, were hiding in the bushes, staring at the gate of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leading captain lowered his voice and said, "Ms. Jared has ordered that everyone inside must be killed, and a batch of magic powders must be seized. Then, the entire production base must be blown up to teach Alexander a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But be careful. They have a lot of guards, and we have to strike first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They then emerged from the bushes like night wolves and sneaked towards the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no moonlight tonight. And in the suburbs, even street lights were scarce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the cover of darkness, they approached the base unnoticed, and each of them was very skilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition to the M16 Assault Rifle in their hands, they also carried a katana with a black scabbard on their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The M16 Assault Rifle had a stable hit rate and could fire in bursts, making it suitable for long-range attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The katana was definitely for close combat, and people from the Risun were best at using the katana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The captain led his companions to approach the base quietly, with a fierce murderous intent spreading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The wild cats and dogs that had originally been played and fought on the roadside sensed that something was wrong and ran away with their tails between their legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there was no sound in the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't notice that two people were lying on the roof of a production workshop. One was Marvin, and the other was Harriet Sabino.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet was Marvin's most capable assistant and also his apprentice. Harriet possessed Level 1 firearm power and was a metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Marvin was holding now was not a sniper rifle but a special crossbow with a unique shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This crossbow was made of special steel with strong toughness, and the bowstring was made of high-tech composite materials with fantastic elasticity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the absence of strong winds, this crossbow could penetrate large trees within 328 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Alexander used the magic circle to help Marvin improve his strength. Marvin had also taken a lot of power elixirs, so he had awakened a powerful Level 2 fire power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the arrow was endowed with fire power, it could definitely penetrate light armor with one arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin nocked an arrow as thick as an index finger, and the arrowhead made of fine steel was glowing red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet picked up the sniper rifle equipped with a silencer and aimed at the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marvin stared at the men in black with full concentration, his eyes filled with cold, murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered to the intercom on his shoulder, "Sir, you are really good at predicting things. The people from the Dragon Gang are here. They are about 525 feet away from us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, don't worry. Wait a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was drinking coffee leisurely in the base office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty asked with great admiration, "Mr. Hawthorne, how did you guess that they would come to cause trouble at night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander smiled but didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zora had ordered her men to launch a surprise attack after getting into the car, and he heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Zora's car had been more than 328 feet away from the base, and the car windows blocked it, but Alexander could still hear it clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander was also very moved. He thought, "The peak of the Intermediate Warrior is so mighty. If I advance to the advanced level, how terrifying will I be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I have been trying very hard to be with beautiful women lately. But there is still no sign of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Force has also reached a bottleneck and is no longer growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems that to advance to become an Advanced Warrior, it is not as simple as before to improve the Force. I have to find an opportunity for advancement."</span></p></div>
