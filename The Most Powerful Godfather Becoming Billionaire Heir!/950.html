        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gripped her hips, helping Ava move in a rhythmic motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hair flew wildly, like a rider on the open plains, her body moving in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I can't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wrapped his arms around her slender waist, his face just inches from her curves. He leaned in, pressing his lips against her, his actions growing more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava responded eagerly, her pace quickening as she neared the peak of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, you're so good at this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander squeezed Ava's hips roughly, occasionally giving them a firm smack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome by the intensity, Ava was swept up in the moment, her body moving with his, each shift taking her further into the depth of their connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath grew quicker, a soft, melodic sound escaping her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's arms draped weakly around him, her legs bent and pressing against the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her moans fluctuated in pitch, carrying a seductive warmth that seemed to seep from deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't remember how many times she had been swept to the edge, her body left weak and trembling, as though she might crumble and never rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could tell Ava was exhausted, so he gently pulled her into his arms and laid her down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was too drained to respond to his passionate kiss, her lips slightly parted as she allowed Alexander to deepen the embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I can't anymore..." she gasped, her body arching desperately before she clung to him, her voice rising in a cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sensation hit again, Ava collapsed back, her limbs splayed out as she struggled to catch her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... really... can't go on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hands explored her breasts with gentle care, occasionally teasing with a soft nip or a lingering touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He traced the curve of her body, moving slowly down her smooth skin, savoring every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the room was filled with the sound of her breath, quick and heavy, as she surrendered to the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was deep, and while Ava had long fallen asleep from exhaustion, Alexander was wide awake, his mind sharp and his energy high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't yet discovered the breakthrough to an advanced Warrior, he could feel he was getting closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With excitement coursing through him, he headed to the basement. All the materials he needed to upgrade his Lightsaber core to level three were ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he began channeling his force, carefully melding each component into the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped by unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the first golden rays of sunlight began to appear on the horizon, Alexander finally emerged from the basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of fatigue lingered in his eyes, but his face was lit up with exhilaration and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Lightsaber had successfully reached the third level, and its power was beyond anything he could have imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level one, the Lightsaber could slice through steel with ease, able to pierce light armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level two, its power grew exponentially, capable of cutting through the frontal </span><span>armor of a main battle tank in a single stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at level three, the power was at least three times greater, maybe more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying force. If Alexander unleashed all his force, he could destroy an entire building with just one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that nagged at him was that he still hadn't found the key to advancing to an Advanced Warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stepping out of the villa, he inhaled the fresh morning air, letting the sounds of chirping birds and the fragrance of flowers calm his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To become an advanced Warrior, he knew he needed to connect with nature and align himself with the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking it slow, like someone out for a morning jog, he strolled down the park's winding path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The park was peaceful, not a soul in sight. The trees provided shade, and the breeze was refreshing. It felt like the perfect place to clear his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a shout from a nearby grove pierced the calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, Alexander approached, and there, in the midst of a small clearing, was a woman he didn't recognize. She had her hair pulled into a high ponytail, wearing a flowing white training outfit, and was practicing martial arts near the grove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside her stood an older man, his hair graying and his clothes black as night. He watched her intently, offering quiet instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sharp eyes scanned the area. He quickly noticed more than a dozen bodyguards hidden in the trees and bushes around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their positions were precise, forming a complex web of crossfire with no blind spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that these two weren't ordinary people.</span></p></div>
