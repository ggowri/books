        <h1>Chapter 288 Poisoning</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Orion and the maid had just finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes, thinking, "What a quick finisher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion pulled out a small packet, smirking darkly as he said, "Honey, remember to slip this into his food. It won't take long, and Ralph will be in hell soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid nodded enthusiastically. "Don't worry, I'll make sure you become family head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara grew angrier with every word; Orion was truly despicable, willing to poison his way to the head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ungrateful, filthy beast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion spoke with bitter resentment, saying, "Ralph keeps saying Lara's the primary heir. He'd never pass the family head position to me, so he has to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid, holding the poison, nestled in his arms, cursing Ralph and Lara with increasingly foul language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such vile, underhanded behavior. It wasn't just Lara who was furious; even Alexander felt his blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the video evidence secured, he straightened his clothes and marched to the door, kicking it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The study door flew open with a crash, slamming to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two inside jumped in fright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander swiftly snatched the poison from the maid's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Alexander! How'd you get here? Give that back!" Orion cursed, reaching for the gun on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion yelled angrily, stretching to grab his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him hard, sending Orion staggering to the ground, coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander then </span><span>bound</span><span> them together with a belt, dragging Orion and the maid, half-dressed, out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara glared, scolding him furiously, "Orion, I recorded everything. Trying to murder my grandfather? You'll rot in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara sent the video to her grandfather, seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Mateo arrived with a group of men, surrounding the culprits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hansen," Mateo said sternly, "Sir Hansen wants an explanation for your despicable actions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lifted Orion and the maid, hauling them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much the two pleaded, no one paid them any attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mateo shot Lara and Alexander a long, expressionless glance before following the group out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara was thrilled. "Alexander, that's the end for Orion. He won't be able to challenge me for the family head position now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, was pondering the butler's lingering, curious look as he'd left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a feeling it wouldn't be easy for Lara to take over as family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would certainly be opposition from within the Hansen family, and Schroder would undoubtedly cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the study, Lara and Alexander lay entangled on the couch, both breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara laughed softly. "Hehe, we've only got an hour, or Ava will get mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara smiled seductively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An hour, huh? That's decent enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's fingers moved like magic across her soft, curvaceous body, with perfect rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara felt her soul melting, her entire being focused on him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking of Ava as Alexander's woman brought Lara a sense of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me enjoy this view," Alexander said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted her soft, smooth curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara went limp, soft as silk, completely at Alexander's mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kneeling with her hips raised high, everything beautiful about her was on full display for Alexander, making her feel shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet an indescribable pleasure surged within, and she couldn't stop herself from whimpering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could no longer resist, moving over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of ecstasy overwhelmed Lara's soul. Though it only lasted an hour, she drifted in and out, trembling from head to toe with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Lara lay there, dazed and flushed, breathing heavily, her cheeks glowing beautifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt a surge of satisfaction and triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have mercy... I can't take it anymore... that was amazing..." Lara murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara gazed at Alexander, entranced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Bzz</span><span>, </span><span>bzz</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed. It was Ava calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly jumped up, answering the call while hastily straightening his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara's face turned red; she wanted to get up but felt too weak.</span></p></div>
