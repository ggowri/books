        <h1>Chapter 584 Greet Your Wife's Mom</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's face felt hot, but he managed a forced smile and said, "Don't worry, I won't get upset. I'll find a way to help Mom get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, you're such a good kid. I knew I made the right choice!" Luther beamed, giving Clay a hearty pat on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for putting you through this, Clay," Richard added kindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Sophie had a thought. She stepped up to Gill and said sweetly, "I just saw Nancy come back with her boyfriend. He's really handsome, way better looking than this guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? </span><span>So</span><span> this piece of shit isn't my daughter's man? You all tricked me!" Gill laughed like a child, delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie nodded confidently. "She'll be here any minute."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic! I can't wait to see Nancy's husband. I hope Nancy has a bunch of kids; that would make me so happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gill clapped her hands excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, everyone casting awkward glances at Clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Gill wasn't all there mentally, Clay still felt utterly humiliated today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther was annoyed and snapped at Sophie, "What nonsense are you spouting? You know your aunt isn't in a good state of mind, and you're still saying these ridiculous things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie pouted defiantly, "Dad, I'm just looking out for Nancy's future. She's beautiful and capable. If she marries this guy... that would be a total waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Clay a disdainful look, clearly unimpressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it! You've got some nerve talking back in front of everyone. Say that again, and I'll tear your mouth apart!" Luther's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He favored his eldest daughter, Nancy, much more than his second daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sophie, please stop! Don't make your dad angry! Just be quiet!" Clara quickly pulled her daughter aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You're restricting my freedom. My sister can marry whoever she wants. If I don't speak up now, you might force me to marry someone even uglier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sophie continued to shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther was livid, rolling up his sleeves, ready to confront her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's voice boomed, "Everyone shut up! It's my birthday! Are you all here just to argue and give me a heart attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed his hands on the table in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every family has its troubles, and the Reynolds family was no different with so many issues at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned back to Clay with a smile. "Clay, don't take it personally. Everyone has their own opinions. But rest assured, we fully support your engagement with Nancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Grandpa Richard. I really appreciate it," Clay said, his spirits lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander would definitely not get the support of Nancy's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard nodded, satisfied with Clay's abilities and background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Nancy was the eldest daughter and the boss of the Kaylon, even if she didn't </span><span>like Clay, she had to make sacrifices for the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft! Ugly pig," Sophie muttered under her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women are usually quite perceptive, especially beautiful ones. Sophie could sense that Clay had ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His beady eyes kept wandering toward her chest, making her uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, footsteps echoed as Nancy walked in, arm-in-arm with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay's expression soured instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! My daughter and her husband are back! Now this is my real daughter and her man!" Gill cheered, clapping her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" Nancy quickly hugged her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she elbowed Alexander, whispering, "Don't just stand there; call her 'Mom'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Alexander finally shyly said, "Mom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the atmosphere in the living room became tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander, then turned to Clay, as if a volcano was ready to erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clay wasn't the only one upset; even the old man and Luther had stern faces, glaring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter's man is so handsome, way better than that ugly pig! My daughter has great taste!" Gill's words only added fuel to the fire.</span></p></div>
