        <h1>Chapter 1240 Burned to Ashes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mortars packed a punch that no rifle could match. Their shells erupted into a storm of shrapnel, tearing hundreds of mutant beasts to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chunks of flesh and blood sprayed through the air in a grotesque display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a dozen mortars fired continuously, their shells raining down destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock waves ripped through the densely packed horde, sending mutant beasts flying. Countless creatures died instantly, while many more lay wounded, only to be trampled to death by their own kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy machine guns joined the assault, cutting down swaths of mutant beasts with devastating effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this beast tide numbered in the thousands&mdash;the casualties were just a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the beasts finally got their bearings, they spotted Augusta's ambush team. Under the mutant monkeys' command, a portion of the horde broke off and charged toward Augusta's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta's team unleashed hell with their superior firepower. Mortar shells and grenades kept exploding among the horde, while heavy machine guns mowed down the creatures leading the charge. It was a one-sided slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the mutant beasts had numbers on their side, and they moved fast. They quickly spread out, howling like demons as they charged in from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Augusta's team started feeling the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These mutant beasts might not have matched human intelligence, but they made up for it with raw speed and power. With the mutant monkeys directing them, they fought like an army of barbarians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A regular army unit, even an elite one, would have broken ranks after facing such a brutal assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these mutant beasts seemed to have gone berserk, attacking with even more savagery than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their increased speed sent chills down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Alexander had come prepared with more than enough ammunition this time. Beyond standard shells, he'd brought over a thousand white phosphorus rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While white phosphorus was banned for use against humans, Alexander figured it was perfect for dealing with these mutant creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how thick their hide was, the white phosphorus would burn straight through to the bone, giving them no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Switch to white phosphorus rounds now!" Augusta barked out his order. "Let's see how these bastards handle a real taste of hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men smoothly loaded the white phosphorus rounds into the mortars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air filled with thunderous explosions as beautiful but deadly white blossoms bloomed in the sky above the mutant horde.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the shells detonated, they released burning phosphorus that spread like lethal flower petals across hundreds of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any beast caught in the blast zone that got even a speck of phosphorus on them started howling in agony as the chemical burned through their flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousand-degree heat ripped through their fur, muscle, and bone in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agonized howls filled the air as the beasts burned. Even mutated, they couldn't shake their primal fear of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white phosphorus rounds transformed a thousand mutant beasts into living torches, turning the battlefield into a sea of flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic spread as the burning creatures crashed into each other, attacking blindly and creating even more chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mutant horde dissolved into mayhem while smoke and the stench of burning flesh filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the burning beasts collapsed. Even as corpses, the flames wouldn't let them rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white phosphorus rounds were ruthless. They wouldn't stop until every body was reduced to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping out over a thousand mutants in one strike, the beasts' ferocious assault finally broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the mutant monkeys commanding them, the surviving beasts had lost their nerve. They hung back, too scared to charge forward recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander, William, and Logan had circled wide around the horde. They approached from behind, ready to take out the mutant monkeys who were calling the shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One mutant monkey stood out from the rest&mdash;clearly the original alpha of the pack, its muscles rippling with terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten other mutant monkeys formed a protective circle around their king, guarding it with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had a gut feeling. If they could take down the alpha, the entire mutant beasts might scatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they still faced thousands of mutant beasts, packed together in waves upon waves like some nightmarish army blocking Alexander's team's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" Alexander's battle cry rang out as he charged headfirst into the beast army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Logan stood their ground beside him, fearless guardians at his flanks. The three of them surged forward like ships braving a tsunami, knowing they could be swallowed by the waves at any moment.</span></p></div>
