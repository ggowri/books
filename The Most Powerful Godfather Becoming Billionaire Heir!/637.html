        <h1>Chapter 637 Mandale Town</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving at the hotel and enjoying a local meal at the restaurant, they retreated to their rooms to shower and rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice, exhausted from serving Alexander during the flight, couldn't muster the energy for anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, she nestled against him, falling asleep in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander got up early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier took him and Alice to Mandale Town, located on the outskirts, home to the largest gem mine in Goldford and the biggest gem trading center in Soutaxia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, it's rough out there. Be cautious and don't flaunt your wealth. I have some contacts, so we should be fine," Xavier warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Alexander and Alice nodded, keen to avoid any trouble and eager to find top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove, Xavier shared stories about local customs and practices, weaving tales filled with anecdotes and amusing incidents. Alexander and Alice laughed heartily, the time passing quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've arrived at Mandale Town!" Xavier announced, parking the rental car on the roadside as they got out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this it?" Alice asked, surveying the bustling surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a small town, it thrived, likely due to its rich gemstone resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was hot, and Alice, dressed in a white camisole and hot pants that showcased her lovely legs, was impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her fit physique&mdash;full breasts, a slender waist, and curvy hips&mdash;she turned heads as they walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Ms. Hollister. It's been several years since I saw you last time. What a coincidence." A bald man suddenly emerged from a shop, flanked by several imposing </span><span>figures who blocked their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked with a steady pace, tall and robust, with fierce looks in their eyes. It was clear they were no ordinary folks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice recognized the man immediately; it was Ian. The smile faded from her face as she retorted coldly, "Ian, how dare you show your face here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint in his eyes as he assessed Ian's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, this guy's part of the Mafia and has a beef with me," Alice whispered, informing Alexander of Ian's background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years ago, Alice met Ian during a mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Ian was defeated by Alice and barely escaped. It was clear that he wanted to take revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, fueled by anger and desire, he was ready to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Ian's territory. With his crew by his side, he must have felt it was time for revenge, and there was no way he was letting Alice off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hollister, fate has brought us together today. There's no escape for you," Ian said as he swaggered toward her, his gaze lingering lustfully on her body and dismissing Alexander and Xavier entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Alice, who was quite skilled, Ian did not take the two men seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alice was about to take action, Alexander gently pulled her behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ian, I'm in a good mood today. Leave now, and I'll spare you," he said, fixing Ian with a cold stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ian's face changed, and then he sized up Alexander with a puzzled look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't taken Alexander seriously, he had been used to being cautious and careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Alexander, besides his handsome appearance, didn't seem to have anything remarkable about him. "Hey brat, do you know whose territory Mandale Town is? How dare you mess with us in the Mafia's territory? Do you have a death wish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in a good mood today. Apologize, and maybe I'll spare your life," Ian mocked, laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you one last chance&mdash;leave," Alexander warned, his voice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you're asking for trouble," Ian replied, a flash of menace flickering in his eyes. He was confident in his fighting skills, thinking he could handle Alexander.</span></p></div>
