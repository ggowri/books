        <h1>Chapter 961 Savoring the Sensation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize grinned mischievously, her chest rising and falling in a way that drew attention, her curves as tempting as ripe fruit, the tips of her breasts a deep, enticing red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful, teasing gesture, she casually placed her palm on Rosalia's even fuller curves, pressing down just enough to make them shift, emphasizing their perfect roundness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but entertain the thought that Charlize might be interested in both men and women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly pushed the idea aside. He didn't have the time or energy to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, with a confident, sensual air, gently nudged him, and he leaned back onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia helped him settle, a playful smile on her face. "Relax, Mr. Hawthorne. Just lie back and let us take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed slightly, a shy yet seductive expression crossing her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander obeyed, lying comfortably on the bed in the most relaxed position he could manage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he settled in, Charlize, with a knowing smile, joined Rosalia at his side. The two women crawled onto the bed, their movements fluid and graceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but admire their figures, both undeniably attractive in their own ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia positioned themselves on either side of him, their gazes fixed on him with an intensity that was both playful and alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize reached over, her fingers working quickly to unfasten his trousers, revealing his huge member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't hide her reaction, her gaze lingering as she took in the sight before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia watched intently, her eyes not leaving the scene before her. She, too, seemed captivated by what was unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was erect with a raw, masculine intensity, veins throbbing angrily, twisting and bulging beneath his skin like coiled cables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander waited in anticipation, Charlize took him in, inch by inch, enveloping him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Alexander thought it couldn't get any more intense, Rosalia brushed her long hair behind her ear, and with a seductive flick of her tongue, she kissed the sensitive area beneath him, sending shivers through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two alluring young women, both exuding sensual </span><span>charm</span><span>, worked in perfect harmony, their lips and tongues skillfully serving Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, he took a deep breath, overwhelmed by a pleasure that was not only intense but deeply satisfying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let go, savoring the sensation as it lifted him higher and higher, sending him soaring to the clouds, then scattering him in a thousand directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though he no longer belonged to this world, as if he had merged completely with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't find the words to describe what he was feeling. His body alternated between being completely relaxed and then taut with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a joy that defied description, tender, electrifying, almost stirring something deep within his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia were truly captivating in their own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With heads lowered, they positioned themselves between Alexander's legs, their lips soft and eager, exchanging gentle kisses and teasing touches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They worked together in perfect sync, their movements both sensual and enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alexander's hands found their way to their smooth, delicate curves, both women shuddered in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They adjusted their positions, aligning themselves to better accommodate his touch, their bodies moving in harmony, making it easier for him to explore further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Alexander felt as if he had everything in the world at his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands, rough and eager, moved over the contours of their hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize and Rosalia had already wet themselves. For them, this was clearly an adrenaline rush like no other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander raised two fingers with each hand, plunging them straight into their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's mouth was packed, but she still couldn't suppress a breathy, pleasure-filled moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia, her mouth around his testicles, let out a soft, muffled moan, the taste lingering as her words faded into a haze of sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to gravity, their ample chests sagged slightly, swaying with each subtle shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but pull them close, making their breasts press against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The softness was incredibly smooth, a touch that felt almost unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize rested her head on Alexander's shoulder, and like Rosalia, reached out to gently take his testicle, teasing him in a playful, skillful manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to suppress the overwhelming desire, Rosalia parted her legs and smoothly straddled him.</span></p></div>
