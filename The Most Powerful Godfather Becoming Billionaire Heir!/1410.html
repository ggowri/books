        <h1>Chapter 1410 Fight to the End</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The command room erupted in an uproar. This problem was more urgent and thorny than the issue of food and weapon ammunition supplies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people in the room started discussing, "What should we do? Hurry up and send out all the reserves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a troop, and I'll fight those monsters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the command room became noisy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph slapped the table hard again and said, "Quiet! Shut up. Reserves? Humph, do we have any reserves? Now, every soldier is on the front line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shout silenced everyone in the command room. It was deathly quiet, and everyone suddenly turned calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had long anticipated this day, but they just didn't expect it to come so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what if they were afraid? Would those monsters accept prisoners?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't a war among humans, where the defeated could surrender, be taken captive, and maybe survive if they were lucky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a clash between monsters and humans, a fight for the survival of the species. In such a war, there was no room for surrender or taking captives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either survived or died. There was absolutely no other way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If people escaped or hid when they were in danger, they would surely end up in a worse situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although no one knew what good it would do to hold out for a few more weeks or months, they had to do it. Maybe a miracle would happen, and a glimmer of hope would appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph stood up, his eyes full of confidence and calmness. "We must believe in the soldiers on the front line and believe in ourselves. It won't be that easy for those monsters to wipe us out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this moment, we must be calm. Otherwise, the others will be panicked even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made everyone blush. In fact, they weren't afraid or in a panic. It was just the excitement and the determination in the face of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Rudolph, you're quite right! We're willing to follow your command and fight to the end." Quentin saluted with the others, and the atmosphere suddenly became serious and solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph was touched, and his face was full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Right now, I want you to send out the news to the whole world that Yinson, the director of Sakra Society, and some high-level members of the Ghost are the masterminds behind this crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was surprised. "Is this okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph snorted, "Humph! What's wrong with that? Even if we're going to die, at least we must let the whole world know that they're the ones causing all this trouble. These scumbags should be made unacceptable to the human in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Marshal Rudolph!" Quentin nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph waved his hand and said, "Alright, now let's discuss how many days our existing food and ammunition supplies can last at most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days! At most three or four days!" the data operator replied affirmatively. "Apart from the soldiers, people in the civilian areas and quarantine zones can only be provided with one lunch and one dinner with a reduced portion from today on. The soldiers will get two full meals. If we reduce it further, they may not be able to maintain their strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph sighed, "With such food supplies, they'll probably only have the strength to shoot. What about the weapons and ammunition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not enough either!" The data operator looked at the computer screen, tapped the keyboard, and several graphs with constantly changing data appeared on the big screen, showing the current inventory of weapons and ammunition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The data operator explained, "If we can't replenish weapons and ammunition from the large warehouses, it's estimated that we'll run out of all bullets and shells in four days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's only enough food for three days, and enough bullets for four days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those monsters are getting more and more numerous. This is really going to be the death of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the data operator's report, Rudolph and Quentin were furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marshal Rudolph!" Just then, a soldier rushed in. Sensing the solemn atmosphere in the command room, he immediately stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldier reported, "Marshal Rudolph, there's trouble in the underground shelter center. They've sent representatives to negotiate with us, demanding that we improve their living standards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially some..." The soldier hesitated and couldn't continue. He stared at stared at Rudolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead." Rudolph was so angry that his face turned pale. He couldn't believe that at this critical moment, there were still people causing trouble.</span></p></div>
