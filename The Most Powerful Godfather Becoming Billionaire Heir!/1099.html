        <h1>Chapter 1099 Still Has Shortcomings</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Alvin found it hard to believe, he quickly smiled and said, "Alright, I'll open the safe right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sample of the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket was locked away in the safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, Alvin took out a sleek black bulletproof vest from the safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, please take a look. This is our company's most advanced product. Not only can it withstand machine gun fire, but it can also resist stabbings and cuts from sharp blades." He paused for a moment. "It offers the wearer absolute protection, and in the world of security, this is a breakthrough like no other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander examined the vest carefully, running his hands over the material before nodding thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a good product, but it still has significant room for improvement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin froze. His expression shifted, and his mood was soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he had been working in this field for over twenty years, specializing in developing bulletproof gear. For Alexander to say there were major flaws in their "all-purpose" vest was a blow to his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had it not been for Alexander's life-saving intervention and his new position as chairman of Silver Shield Security, Alvin might have fired back with a sharp retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A white-haired old man standing nearby shot Alexander a glare, his displeasure evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, with all due respect, I have to disagree. This vest represents the culmination of years of research and development. It's a revolutionary product, and frankly, I'm surprised you would suggest there's still significant room for improvement. We've tested it extensively, and it's far beyond anything else on the market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin quickly stepped in, trying to smooth things over. " Mr. Hawthorne, this is Gabriel, our Chief R&amp;D Designer. He's been with us for years, and his expertise is unmatched."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel huffed audibly, muttering under his breath, "Young as he is, even as chairman, he should learn to respect our work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine, clearly not pleased, interjected, "Gabriel, Alexander knows what he's talking about. If he says there is significant room for improvement, there definitely is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maxine had developed a deep admiration for Alexander, a mix of affection and respect. She would not tolerate anyone speaking ill of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel frowned but said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Alexander had managed to wrest control of Silver Shield from the Nicholson family, which meant he was no ordinary man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gabriel, however, felt his pride as the lead designer being questioned and didn't take kindly to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin quickly reassured, "Gabriel, the chairman isn't doubting us. He just has his own thoughts on the matter. Don't take it personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tension in the room was palpable, and the R&amp;D team exchanged looks, their faces neutral but clearly skeptical. They didn't fully respect Alexander's opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alvin's brow furrowed. On one hand, he understood the years of hard work his team had put into these products, their expertise in their field. On the other hand, Alexander was his family's savior, and he was caught between the two sides, unsure of how to smooth things over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were being objective, Alvin couldn't shake the feeling that Alexander was just boasting. There was no way someone who wasn't a specialist in this field could have more insight than the team of professionals who had been developing these products for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave a slight, indifferent smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that people in research often became rigid in their thinking, especially those with great expertise. The more skilled they were, the more stubborn they tended to be, unable to accept outside opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't going to hold any grudges against Gabriel or the team&mdash;they were his employees, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was determined to make them understand that there were always new heights to reach, that there was always someone who knew more, even in their area of expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With everyone's eyes on him, Alexander calmly picked up the bulletproof vest and began speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand that the reason this vest is all-purpose is due to the new composite material you've developed. It's impressive how it combines both bulletproof and stab-resistant capabilities, providing a high level of protection. This is indeed a comprehensive solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, Alvin and Gabriel's expressions softened. They thought for a moment that Alexander was acknowledging the advantages of their product.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However,..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander's tone turned serious, and his eyes was fixed on the vest as he continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest that when using this material to create bulletproof vests, you first form the material into hollow triangular micro-particles, and then press them in multiple layers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Triangles are the most stable structural shape. By making them hollow, you reduce the weight, and with multi-layered compression, coupled with a metal wire mesh, the protective capacity will be greatly enhanced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone, from Alvin to Gabriel, stared at Alexander in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, Alvin, still trying to process this, stammered, "Mr. Hawthorne... We... we misunderstood you. How... how did you know all of this?"</span></p></div>
