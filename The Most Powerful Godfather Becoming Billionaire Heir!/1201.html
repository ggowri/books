        <h1>Chapter 1201 What a Joke</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene before the crowd defied belief. People whispered among themselves, wondering if this was some elaborate performance art piece for the music festival or maybe a movie being filmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than twenty bodies lay scattered across and around the stage, blood seeping from their wounds and pooling on the ground beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone </span><span>call</span><span> 911! We need ambulances here now!" Voices rippled through the crowd as panic spread. The audience's murmurs swelled into a constant buzz that </span><span>filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level of violence had left everyone shaken. This kind of brutality belonged in action movies, not a music festival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna stared at Alexander with pure terror in her eyes. The color had drained from her face as she looked at him like he was Death himself, stepping straight out of hell and onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she had run out of options. If Alexander decided to kill her right here, there was nothing she could do to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow of death loomed over her like a dark cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander maintained his eerily calm demeanor as he continued his steady approach toward Sienna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure radiating from Alexander hit Sienna like a physical force. It felt like a mountain was crushing down on her, making her knees buckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raw terror gripped her chest, squeezing the air from her lungs until she could barely breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I'm Sienna from the Rhodes family. We're loaded!" Her voice cracked with desperation. "I can apologize. I was way out of line before. I'm sorry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear me? I apologized. I can pay compensation. Please don't hurt me. I'm the Rhodes family heiress. If you harm me, you'll end up in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's beautiful face had turned ghostly pale. Her body trembled uncontrollably as she rambled on like someone having a mental breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander met her pleas with nothing but contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so now you care about breaking the law? What about when you were threatening my woman and child? When you tried to hire thugs to cripple me in public? How do you explain that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna could barely get the words out. "I-I'm the Rhodes family heiress... I'm the R-Rhodes family heiress..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!" Alexander burst into laughter, unable to contain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Rhodes family means absolutely nothing to me. I've never even heard of them. Are they supposed to be such a big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're way out of line. How dare you disrespect the Rhodes family! We're one of </span><span>Newbrook's</span><span> most powerful families. You're just a nobody compared to us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's words carried a hint of defiance, but fear had taken root in her heart. It was crystal clear that Alexander couldn't care less about the Rhodes family or their supposed influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When threats and bribes failed, Sienna switched to a desperate final tactic. "I'm a woman, and I've apologized. You have to let me go! If you don't, you'll face legal consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander closed the distance between them, towering over her slight frame. His contemptuous gaze bore down on her with the imperious disdain of an emperor regarding a beggar in the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do?" Panic made Sienna's voice shrill. "Everyone's watching! I haven't laid a hand on you. If you dare touch me&mdash;" Her words cut off in a choked gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's hand shot out and seized her throat, lifting her off her feet as easily as a hawk snatching up a mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna clawed frantically at his iron grip, her perfectly manicured nails scrabbling uselessly against his fingers. Despite her desperate struggles, she couldn't budge even one of his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lack of oxygen turned her face from red to purple to an alarming shade of blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her wild thrashing, the shoulder of her designer dress slipped down, revealing her breasts, but Alexander didn't even spare a glance at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with contempt. "The Rhodes family's precious genius? What a joke. You're nothing, yet you dare look down on my woman and child? You even threatened to destroy me? That's real rich coming from someone like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice, radiating murderous intent with every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sienna's struggles grew weaker by the second. Her face had taken on an ashen hue. At this rate, she wouldn't last another minute before suffocating in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava's heart clenched at the scene. She opened her mouth to intervene but caught herself, the words dying in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed Ava's hesitation from the corner of his eye, instantly reading the compassion in her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, even Sienna didn't deserve to die for her actions. Alexander had meant to teach her a harsh lesson, not commit murder in front of a festival crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, darkness crept into the edges of Sienna's vision as her mind grew foggy. Death felt real now. It was not just a concept but a tangible presence crushing down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man before her was terrifying beyond words. She realized with crystal clarity that he could snuff out her life as easily as stepping on a bug.</span></p></div>
