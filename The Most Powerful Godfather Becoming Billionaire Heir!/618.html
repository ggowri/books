        <h1>Chapter 618 Top-Quality Ore</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the high probability of yielding top-grade gems, the reserve price for this ore block was set extremely high, starting at 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Based on my experience, there's a tremendous chance that this top-notch ore block contains top-grade gems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're absolutely right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's the gem of the auction&mdash;starting at 10 million dollars! Can you believe it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The price isn't outrageous; it's a gamble worth taking. If you hit top-grade gems, you'll make a fortune."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with speculation and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host stood on the raised platform, lifting the microphone. "Welcome, distinguished guests, to the grand opening of the stone speculation auction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were met with thunderous applause from below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This premium ore block starts at 10 million dollars, with minimum bids of a hundred thousand dollars. Let the bidding commence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the host spoke, the crowd erupted into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eleven million dollars for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve and a half million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prices soared, and Morton watched with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This premium ore block had been arduously sourced by the Mafia, and although he was the auction's head, he also aimed to acquire it for himself, reaping a substantial profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander scrutinized the massive ore block with his All-seeing Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it seemed to promise top-grade gems, boasting an exceptional appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he noticed that the internal glow was sparse, scarcely worth the hefty reserve price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever paid top dollar for this stone would surely regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a high reserve price&mdash;it must be chock-full of treasures inside, right?" Olivia inquired with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head and chuckled. "It's scrap&mdash;nothing inside at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! Don't pretend to know what you're talking about. I'm sure there are top-grade gems in this ore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton glared at </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> his contempt evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy sneered, saying, "What an ignorant fool&mdash;this is a premium ore block, painstakingly procured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, you must win this bid and uncover those top-grade gems to utterly </span><span>humiliate this guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sandy goaded, planting a passionate kiss on Morton's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, didn't you say I'm your lucky charm? Today will be your lucky day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton nodded repeatedly, brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Baby, rest assured&mdash;this ore block is as good as mine. I'll secure it for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another bidder chimed in, "Thirteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the price surged by three million dollars, the number of participants dwindled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was just a stone, promising the possibility of top-grade gems but fraught with the risk of a disastrous flop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirteen million dollars were already a hefty sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton, however, was steadfast in his resolve, and with Sandy's incessant encouragement and fueling of his ego, he felt more assured than ever that the ore block harbored top-grade gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he raised his paddle, adding another million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fourteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a hush. Morton surveyed the silent crowd </span><span>triumphantly,</span><span> certain he had vanquished all competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host's excitement was palpable as he waved his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fourteen million dollars! Mr. Whitlock bids fourteen million dollars! This mineral is something special, and we, the Mafia, are all about fairness. Even our partner, Mr. Whitlock, has to play by the rules and join the bidding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fourteen million dollars, going twice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host raised his gavel high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face lit up with a sudden idea, and he shot his hand up. "Sixteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton fumed, taken aback by Alexander's boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You dare to compete with me? You think you can snag a bargain? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he added, "Seventeen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighteen million dollars! This stone must have top-grade gems hidden inside. I'm determined to win it today!" Alexander declared confidently, putting on a show of bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Olivia was taken aback, thinking, "Just a moment ago, Alexander dismissed this stone as worthless. What's got into him to jump into the bidding now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morton's eyes blazed with fury. "You arrogant fool! You really think you can outbid me? Nineteen million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander replied, unfazed, his confidence radiating, "Twenty million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitlock, just give it up. This stone is as good as mine. You won't win this, so why not save yourself the trouble and back down?"</span></p></div>
