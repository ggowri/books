        <h1>Chapter 422 Whack-A-Mole</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold snort, his gaze becoming even more ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For such a trivial matter, these people dared to use deadly force. They must have done this sort of thing many times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed the wrist of a thug wielding a knife and twisted it with a flick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug's hand immediately contorted painfully, causing him to roll on the ground in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others didn't fare any better, as Alexander quickly dispatched them with a few swift punches and kicks, leaving them sprawled on the ground, howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One overweight thug attempted to sneak up from behind, but Alexander seemed to have eyes in the back of his head. He seized the thug's throat and lifted him </span><span>effortlessly, like an eagle capturing its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harassing women, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the thug down, delivering several hard slaps that left the man's mouth bleeding and his face swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar fell silent; everyone was stunned by Alexander's display of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who dares to cause trouble on the territory of the Ultimate Alliance?" a furious voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ultimate Alliance!?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Alexander and Betty were taken aback, then exchanged knowing smirks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a group of over a dozen men burst in, led by a towering figure standing nearly six and a half feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular man, bare-chested and seething with anger, glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overweight thug displayed his injuries to the giant, trying to play the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kelvin, it's this punk! Look at what he did to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin pointed at Alexander, shouting, "You little brat, do you know we're the number one gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bravado made him look like he was someone important within the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number one gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander paused for a moment, then shared a knowing smile with Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, the Ultimate Alliance had gained this level of reputation and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, whether it was the Cripples, the Blood Gang, or the Fraternity, they had all fallen to Alexander's might. The Federer and Hansen families also had to bow to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Oscar Stewart from the Kaylon had to yield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Ultimate Alliance controlled the source of the magic powder, swiftly solidifying their status as the top gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander should have felt pleased, but these arrogant little thugs were ruining his mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin approached, flanked by his men, surrounding Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an expressionless face, Alexander asked, "You don't recognize me? Or her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin glanced at Alexander, then at Betty, and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are just small fries. Who the hell knows who you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Alexander and Betty couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. If he didn't even recognize Betty, it was clear he was just a low-level member of the Ultimate Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty thought for a moment and asked, "Is your leader Maurice Wells?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! You know our boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin's expression shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maurice, right? I'll have him come over right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty pulled out her phone and began dialing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin looked stunned, unsure of what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overweight thug shouted, "Kelvin, this woman is cunning! There's no way she knows Mr. Wells!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin thought for a moment. He knew people around Maurice, but he didn't recognize Betty and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just trying to buy time to escape. Don't think I'm as stupid as you. Apologize and compensate, or I'm going to make my move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin tightened his fists menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Betty spoke coldly into her phone. "Maurice, you have five minutes to get here, or else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maurice didn't have a chance to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin and his thugs were momentarily taken aback, then burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can fool us like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can call Mr. Wells here with just one phone call, I'll kneel and lick your shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you said it. Get ready to kneel and lick shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kelvin fumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're the number one gang in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>! I'll take responsibility for this, take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Kelvin's command, his men rushed at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like lightning, swiftly grabbing two of the first attackers and throwing them aside as if they were mere feathers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, the two thugs weighed at least eight hundred pounds, yet they flew effortlessly through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a game of whack-a-mole as the two men slammed down onto Kelvin and his crew with a heavy thud.</span></p></div>
