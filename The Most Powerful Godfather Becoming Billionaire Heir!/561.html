        <h1>Chapter 561 Place Your Bets</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gone too far." Barry shook with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix laughed. "You two pieces of trash dare to make threats? Kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger Felix had been holding back now surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Barry growled, stopping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was surprised. "What? They can't be killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry pushed him aside and snorted, "Felix, I'm a man of my word when it comes to gambling. No violence here. If you ruin my reputation, who'd dare to gamble with me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix fell silent, resisting the urge to slap Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was nothing but a gambling-addicted fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer warned Felix, "This is the Kaylon entertainment center. Fights and killings are strictly prohibited. Anyone who dares break the rules will face serious consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix frowned, sensing the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Kaylon entertainment center was no less powerful than the Red Umbrella Group. Their members were formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer wasn't bluffing. If a fight broke out here, it wouldn't end well for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix reluctantly stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two," Barry challenged, "do you have the guts to gamble with me again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley burst into laughter. "Barry, with your skills? Think you can beat me? But since you're eager to lose, I can play along. How much are you ready to put up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, how much did you bring?" Jaylon echoed, rubbing his chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was annoyed. "You two idiots, since when have I ever lost without paying? This time, I'm going to win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix could see how tense Barry was. Clearly, he was uncertain of his chances, betting for the sake of gambling alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Barry was a level-three metahuman and a skilled fighter, gambling was a different expertise. He was hardly a match for Finley and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want to play," Finley taunted, "we'll play a few rounds. I'm going to win every cent from you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even you woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He eyed Joyce lustfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry snorted, glaring at him from across the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joyce, Diego, and Felix stood silently behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley lit a cigarette, took a leisurely drag, and asked mockingly, "So, Barry, do you </span><span>dare to play cards?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on," Barry replied firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer swayed over to the table, preparing to deal the cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finley, Jaylon, and even Barry couldn't help glancing at her cleavage and hips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on," Diego interrupted abruptly. "Miss, you'd better follow the rules while dealing. Don't think I won't catch you if you try anything shady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dealer smiled calmly, "Sir, this is Kaylon Entertainment Center. We're honest in all dealings, with daily transactions worth billions, even tens of billions. Do you think we'd risk our reputation over your small change? How amusing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego fell silent, cowed by her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry examined the deck carefully but found nothing amiss. The game officially began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first card was dealt to Barry, Finley, and Jaylon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry peeked at his card and almost cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix fumed at his reaction, knowing that he had drawn a bad card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an idiot!" Felix cursed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was his money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaylon and Finley appeared perfectly at ease, each smoking a cigarette and not even bothering to look at their cards.</span></p></div>
