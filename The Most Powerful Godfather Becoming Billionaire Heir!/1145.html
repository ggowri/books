        <h1>Chapter 1145 I'll Deal With Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">With the power of Sunrise Group behind him, Karson held significant influence at the port.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Joaquin had initially planned to poison Karson, but his security was too tight, and after exhausting all his drugs, he failed miserably.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Karson? I&#x27;ll take care of him!&quot; Stephen scoffed derisively.</p><p style="text-align:left;">*****</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, Alexander was on his way to Louvian when his phone rang—it was a call from Quentin.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alex, I&#x27;ve just received word that Stephen from Sakra Society has arrived in Louvian. They&#x27;re planning to attack my friend Karson. Can you help him out for my sake?&quot; Quentin asked, his tone more of a plea than a demand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s interest was piqued. He had been worried about locating someone from Sakra Society, and since Quentin was Brittany&#x27;s grandfather and had supported him greatly, he felt inclined to help.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I will definitely help him!&quot; he replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Great! I&#x27;ll have Karson reach out to you,&quot; Quentin said, hanging up with a sense of relief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before long, two black Cadillacs pulled up, hazard lights flashing, leading the way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander smiled, &quot;Karson&#x27;s people are here already. That was quick.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">With the Chapman family&#x27;s vehicles in the lead, Alexander&#x27;s BMW sailed through intersections, ignoring red lights.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The journey that usually took over three hours was cut down to just two as they arrived at Karson&#x27;s residence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson had constructed an impressive ancient castle by the sea, a lavish imitation of royal architecture, showcasing great wealth and power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The heavy security surrounding the castle made it clear that the owner held an extraordinary status. Armed guards patrolled the area, and there were booths equipped with heavy weaponry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander recognized immediately that these guards were mercenaries seasoned from battle, each with piercing eyes that radiated a dangerous aura.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An old man with gray hair approached with a hearty laugh. &quot;Hey, Alex! You&#x27;re finally here. I&#x27;ve been looking forward to your arrival! Come in and take a seat.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">His familiarity instantly brought him close to Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Louvian was not far from Loscity, and Karson was understandably cautious about Ultimate Alliance&#x27;s might, especially since Alexander was invited by Quentin for assistance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alex, thank you for coming!&quot; Karson greeted warmly, shaking Alexander&#x27;s hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Chapman, it&#x27;s my pleasure,&quot; Alexander replied with a smile as he followed Karson into the castle and settled into a spacious, opulent living room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alongside Karson and Alexander sat three others.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A quick glance revealed they were all formidable individuals, one of whom was a metahuman with powers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their presence was palpable; their breathing was slow yet powerful, distinctive enough for Alexander to discern immediately.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alex, please take a seat here,&quot; Karson said, motioning for Alexander to take the head seat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Without hesitation, Alexander sat down.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar Dussel, dressed in black, shot a challenging look at Alexander. &quot;Hey, kid, that&#x27;s pretty presumptuous of you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander asked coldly, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cesar frowned. &quot;Don&#x27;t play dumb. The people in front of you are all notable figures. Do you really think you belong in the most important chair?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was speechless. Fighting over a seat seemed rather petty to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Despite Cesar&#x27;s fiery temperament, his intense gaze and heavily calloused fists hinted at a dangerous capability that made people scared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Youngsters today really lack respect for elders,&quot; another man chimed in, targeting Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was Dariel Garvey, a towering figure over 6.3 feet tall, broad-shouldered with big hands and thick fingers.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Everyone...&quot; Karson began to explain, but Alexander interjected.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He said calmly, &quot;There&#x27;s no point in wasting our breath on them. When Stephen arrives, we&#x27;ll let our actions speak for themselves.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Karson nodded awkwardly, opting to remain silent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Dariel narrowed his eyes at Alexander, scoffing, &quot;Actions? I could take down Stephen on my own. I don&#x27;t see why Mr. Chapman would give you a shot.&quot;</p></div>
