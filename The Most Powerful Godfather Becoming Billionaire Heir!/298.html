        <h1>Chapter 298 The Poisoned Needle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Alexander reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin quickly helped Frank towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was seriously injured and had a high fever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He relied on Melin to support him. Although Melin's injury had healed, she was still a woman and her strength was limited, so they moved very slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of thugs got restless again, surrounding them and looking for a chance to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone comes near, he dies first!" Alexander threatened, holding Rosen in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen desperately cried out, "Don't come near. If anyone comes, I'll kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs stopped in their tracks, glaring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smirked. If it weren't for worrying about Melin and Frank's safety, he would have sent all these thugs to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin finally managed to help Frank into the police car. She opened the car door and </span><span>waved frantically at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in the car!" she shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander dragged Rosen and quickly rushed towards the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the thugs tried to chase them, Alexander suddenly turned back and swung Rosen around like a windmill, knocking the thugs down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Alexander laughed, throwing Rosen into the trunk and jumping into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin stepped on the gas, and the car sped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a dart flew out from a nearby bush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hit Melin in the right chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin grunted in pain but managed to control the car and keep driving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several SUVs chased after the police car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short while later, the police car stopped in a quiet grove, hiding from the pursuers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frank had fainted from his injuries and the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin felt dizzy and weak, slumping in her seat and gasping for breath. Her face was flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly used the Force to check Melin's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been hit by a dart, and the dart was poisonous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was surprised as Melin's current state was similar to when Betty was drugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, you've been poisoned. And this poison requires a man to treat," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Needs a man?" Melin was confused at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her face turned redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already called for backup. The doctor and support will be here soon. I don't need your help. Let the doctor treat me," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had a good impression of Alexander, she couldn't accept that kind of treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the dart had hit her right chest, a very private area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she adored Alexander, she couldn't let him see it so casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sighed and smiled bitterly, "Do you think I want to help you? I have a girlfriend. The ambulance will take at least an hour to find us, and then it will take another hour to send you to the hospital for diagnosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the time the treatment starts, it will be two or three hours later. According to my judgment, you can't wait that long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was feeling stranger. Her body was burning hot, tingling, and very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but moan, "Take off your mask. Let me see your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander hesitated for a moment but still took off the silver mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin stared at Alexander's handsome face, and her heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to be so handsome," she said, feeling a warm current rising from her belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt itchy and couldn't help but moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't let you treat me, what will happen?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought for a moment and said, "It will damage your nervous system. You </span><span>might become stupid or turn into someone who only wants men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Melin was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander explained, "Ordinary antidotes won't work for this poisoned dart. That's the purpose of making this special dart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I think the person who made it has some perverted hobby, so they use this dart to harm women."</span></p></div>
