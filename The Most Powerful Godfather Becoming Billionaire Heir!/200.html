        <h1>Chapter 200 Senior Guild</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander propped his leg up, eating the apple the beauty prepared, and said calmly, "Now that Gary is dead, you don't need to recommend a new leader. Let's establish a family Senior Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each of you will be an elder, and all affairs of the Federer family will be decided by </span><span>your votes; majority rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior members </span><span>suddenly became excited</span><span>, their eyes filled with greedy desire for power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>was</span><span> one leader</span><span> before</span><span>, but </span><span>with</span><span> this Senior Guild, each would have a share of power, which seemed quite appealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alexander shifted his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I will be your Chief Elder, holding </span><span>the</span><span> veto, with Edward as my representative. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone from the Federer family was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was outright stealing; he was treating the Federer family like a juicy piece of meat to take a big bite out of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This so-called Chief Elder was essentially a disguised leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the senior members turned pale, clearly reluctant, but they dared not oppose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward was equally shocked; he hadn't expected Alexander to make him his representative, no wonder he had mentioned earlier about giving him wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's feelings were </span><span>complicated</span><span>; even though he claimed to be the top fighter in the Federer family, he was just</span><span> in</span><span> middle management at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering the true upper </span><span>level</span><span> might never be possible </span><span>if not for today</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? </span><span>Don</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t you agree</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't interfere in your Federer family matters as long as you give me 20% of your profits each year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I won't take your money for nothing; I can offer you magic powder at a 30% discount. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior members of the Federer family whispered among themselves but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all cunning old foxes, aware that Alexander's sweet words now could lead to unknown </span><span>results</span><span> later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps once Alexander secured his position in the Federer family, he would </span><span>take away</span><span> everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There is no limit to one</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s g</span><span>reed; they had to be on guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took another bite of the apple, and seeing their continued reluctance, his expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you refuse my </span><span>offer</span><span>, don't </span><span>regret it later</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander struck several of the senior members with a swift hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Force surged into their bodies, like an invisible drill stirring within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! My head hurts so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My body aches</span><span> everywhere</span><span>! Alexander, what have you done to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fell to the ground, rolling and moaning in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their painful expressions terrified Edward and the beautiful woman, leaving their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a few guys were in so much pain they couldn't make a sound, gradually becoming motionless and only able to moan weakly on the ground, that Alexander </span><span>finally retracted the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, they felt a wave of relief, as if they had just escaped a living hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander coldly warned. "If you don't want to experience that kind of pain again, you'd better cooperate with me. Otherwise, I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll make sure </span><span>you won't even be able to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, we</span><span> agree. We</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ll</span><span> cooperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, Mr. Hawthorne will be the Chief Elder of the Federer family, holding veto."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few of them, with gloomy faces, could only agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Starting today, the matters of the Federer family will be managed by the Senior Guild. Edward, you will be my agent from now on; is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at Edward with a half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will follow all of Mr. Hawthorne's orders; I wouldn't dare defy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing the terror of the bloody night, he was already intimidated by Alexander's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Alexander's mysterious abilities and decisive demeanor, he had </span><span>given up</span><span> any thoughts of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To such a powerful figure, </span><span>submission was the only choice</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I'm not around, Edward will be my agent; do any of you have a problem with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned to the Federer family members with a sly smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No problem</span><span>; Edward is one of </span><span>the family anyway</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Edward is the best among the Federer family. With Mr. Hawthorne backing us up, we'll be unstoppable in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, thanks to Mr. Hawthorne, the Federer family will definitely reach new heights."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several senior members were desperately flattering Alexander.</span></p></div>
