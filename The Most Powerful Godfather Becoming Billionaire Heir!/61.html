        <h1>Chapter 61 The Provocation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the wizard was killed by a powerful Warrior, the recipe for the magic powder fell into the hands of the Warrior, who spread it to other Warriors gradually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The magic powder could improve physical fitness and eliminate diseases without any side effects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It gave people the illusion that their dreams had come true and brought great satisfaction to both men and women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Drugs were rampant in Loscity now. If the magic powder was made, it would not only help addicts break free from the control of drugs and turn them into healthy normal people but also bring a big income.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander smiled and murmured, "Guzman, aren't you the biggest drug dealer? I'll use the magic powder to replace drugs and cut off your source of income. Let's see how you can fight me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander acted immediately and called Billy, asking him to send someone to deliver the dozen or so materials he needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The materials for making the magic powder were very common except for the Datura flower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Billy didn't dare to ask Alexander why he needed the materials. He came to deliver them in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander stayed in the room and worked hard for most of the day. In the end, he made a few packets of blue powder. It was the magic powder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After thinking about it, Alexander decided to keep it a secret from Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked Billy to promote the magic powder first. After it became popular, he would make the Saint Group the general agent, who would be responsible for overall sales.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The money had to go to the Saint Group, which could make the magic powder popular around the world with its strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, the Saint Group's market value would soar, and Alexander would get most of the profit as the developer. He was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he had the money, Alexander could truly establish his own power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His cell phone rang. It was Lily calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Alexander answered the call, he quickly smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lily learned that he had a new girlfriend and wanted to meet her. Alexander of course agreed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next morning, he went to see Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava was not in the office. She was at her home, a mansion at the Manhadion beach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She liked to stand on her balcony and admire the blue sky and sea, so she had been living here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander followed the servant into the house, surprised to see there were guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them was a beautiful young woman, and the other was an acquaintance, Vincent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander, this is my best friend and college classmate, Rebecca."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is my boyfriend, Alexander."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava introduced them enthusiastically, ignoring Vincent, who sat on the side awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard that you cured Ava's angina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was obvious distrust in Rebecca's tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander said calmly, "It has not been completely cured yet. The treatment will take a long time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given Ava's identity and status, her university must not be ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca was arrogant. Alexander guessed she had brought Vincent here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, I think you'd better ask Vincent for his diagnosis. He has been my friend for many years and is an expert in cardiovascular diseases. His methods are different from those quacks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca persuaded Ava in front of Alexander.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Obviously, she was saying Alexander was a quack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent quickly said, "Ms. Blackburn, I've learned about your condition. Congenital cardiovascular stenosis is difficult to deal with, but I know a new medicine that can definitely cure you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava couldn't help but feel hopeful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she no longer suffered the pain, Alexander also said that she had not been completely cured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why didn't she give it a try if the new medicine Vincent mentioned was effective?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, please believe me. Rebecca and I have been friends since childhood, and I will never lie to you. I'm not like those quacks, who claim they can cure you by giving you a massage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Vincent spoke, he stared at Alexander with a provocative look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander gave a cold smile and said, "Why didn't you cure your grandfather yesterday if you're so capable? Why are you pretending here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was baffled, his face as red as beetroots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca obviously didn't know what had happened yesterday, nor did she know the truth. She only listened to Vincent's one-sided story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ava, why don't you try Vincent's new medicine? Don't you trust me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander...you won't be angry, will you?" Ava asked with a smile. She wouldn't give it a try if Alexander didn't agree.</p></div>
