        <h1>Chapter 642 The Axe</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Oldman, should we chase them?" One of his subordinates asked in a flattering manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the fuck are you talking about? Are you blind? They've already gone away! Get out of my way, idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With extreme anxiety, Paxton kicked him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell everyone to find out their identities. I want them dead!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent thirteen gunmen yet failed to end his targets' lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ian's brother, Paxton must avenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the siren not far away, Paxton reluctantly gestured to his men to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander and his companies had already fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just about to console the beautiful lady in the backseat. After all, he had some kind of robbed her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she asked, "You're hunted by the Mafia. Did you offend them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her knowledge of the Mafia made Alice frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a while, Alexander chose to tell the truth, "I broke Ian's legs; that's why they want to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You did break Ian's legs?" She smiled in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at her from the rear-view mirror, Alexander presumed that she had feuded with the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good. No wonder they're hunting you. As Ian's brother, Paxton is very vindictive. For the sake of the humiliation his brother suffered, he will be bound to target you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said that, her eyes moved back and forth between Alice and Xavier and finally fixed on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the Mafia's domination, no one dared to rebel against them as they did in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paxton controlled more than half of the gem transactions in the town, as well as some illegal businesses such as casinos and whorehouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With few people daring to go against the Mafia, they suffered a great loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alice asked tentatively, "Excuse me, who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Alyssa Bianchi. I'm from the Axe." Alyssa didn't intend to hide her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alyssa? The Axe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These names triggered Xavier's nerves, and he hurriedly whispered everything he knew about this lady and her gang to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe belonged to Alyssa and was also a major force in Mandale Town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Born in a poor family, Alyssa appealed to her friends in the village to form the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there weren't so many people in her gang, their unity and aggressiveness contributed to their current status in Mandale Town, which also enabled them to profit in gem trading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, it was still a rather small gang and couldn't compete with the Mafia at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, due to their solidarity, the Mafia also wouldn't rashly turn against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Axe was often exploited by Paxton in the gem trade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa couldn't afford the price to offend the Mafia, so she could only endure the unfair treatment in a sulk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Mafia was way too powerful, not to mention other forces that were coveting to annex the Axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Axe and the Mafia were at war, those malicious forces would tear Alyssa's gang apart and swallow it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Alyssa adopted the strategy of forbearing and conciliatory and avoided direct conflict with the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alyssa knew clearly that continuing this policy would only lead to self-destruction sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It worried her a lot. After encountering Alexander, she realized his capability at once and thought about hiring him as her assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bianchi, hello. I'm Alexander, and they are Alice and Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander introduced them very calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa was very curious about Alexander. Despite his harmless look, he actually had the guts to cripple Ian in this town. His ruthlessness really surprised and impressed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Loscity. We just arrived in the town," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa nodded and showed a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're the Mafia's enemy, you're my friend. I can offer you a shelter for a few days. Don't worry. No matter how powerful Paxton is, he wouldn't dare to rampage in my territory."</span></p></div>
