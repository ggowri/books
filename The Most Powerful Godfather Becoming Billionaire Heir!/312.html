        <h1>Chapter 312 Uninvited Guests</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved increasingly faster, carving a total of ninety-three </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Patterns before he had to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Force had been fully depleted. He couldn't continue for the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling an unprecedented weakness in his body, he was both helpless and relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hadn't managed to carve one hundred and eight patterns, he knew that after meditating, his Force would surely be restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, he sat cross-legged and began to meditate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his eyes shut, it felt as if he possessed a mystical vision, allowing him to perceive everything around him without opening his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart beat slowly at a certain rhythm, resonating with the energies of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stream of mysterious energy was drawn into him, transforming into the Force and replenishing his earlier exhaustion...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure how long it had been, but eventually, Alexander stood up, feeling revitalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was pitch black. Glancing at the time revealed it was the early hours of the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled softly, planning to find Ava for some intimate relaxation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his expression changed, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few unsavory characters were stealthily approaching in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Quentin doesn't trust me and fears I might escape? No, they are Shadow Warriors&mdash;definitely members of the Red Umbrella Group..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the curtains, he could see clearly, a woman accompanied by three men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wore a black combat outfit, a katana strapped to her back, leading the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close behind her was a muscular man with a red bandana tied around his head. His </span><span>bare</span><span> arms were bandaged at the elbows and knees, his muscles bulging with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also two figures in gray robes, adorned with a necklace of white bones and wielding a bone staff&mdash;clearly, they were wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Alexander went directly to the living room, waiting for them to walk into his trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the front door was gently pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group rushed in swiftly, and suddenly the bright lights flickered on, illuminating the living room in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four figures stumbled in from the darkness, momentarily blinded by the sudden brightness, their heads buzzing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of confusion, they began to survey their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they noticed Alexander casually lounging on the sofa, they were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that he had anticipated their arrival. He didn't flee. He was waiting here for them. The group was momentarily at a loss&mdash;should they call this guy impressive or just plain reckless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman at the front drew her katana, its blade gleaming sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fitted black outfit accentuated her voluptuous figure, making her appearance strikingly alluring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her face was obscured by a black mask, revealing only her large, expressive eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While her features were hidden, her captivating physique and expressive eyes were mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular man beside her licked his lips, gazing at Alexander like a tiger eyeing its prey, a fierce grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two wizards wore cold expressions, their gazes toward Alexander filled with cruelty and bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you actually didn't run away. You've got quite a nerve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular man glared at him, cracking his knuckles ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander relaxed in his seat, observing them silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his silence, the man assumed he had frightened him into shock and burst into arrogant laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, I'm here to take him back, and no one should interfere with my glory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman and the two wizards remained silent, merely casting disapproving glances at the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscular man swaggered toward Alexander, his demeanor that of a hawk about to seize its prey, exuding an air of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of danger glinted in Alexander's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's asking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man roared, lunging forward with outstretched hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack was as swift as a hawk diving from the sky, the force of his movement whipping Alexander's hair in the wind as he closed the distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his opponent wore a victorious grin, Alexander sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even rising from the sofa, he kicked out decisively.</span></p></div>
