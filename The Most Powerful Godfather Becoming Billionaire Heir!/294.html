        <h1>Chapter 294 Hiding Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's vision went dark, and she was frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew this was a psychological trick, she felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move!" Rosen shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a dagger and placed it on Melin's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin felt the cold blade and tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't control her body from shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I ask you a question, you answer one question. If you don't answer, I will strip you naked and expose you to everyone. Understand?" Rosen threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't touch me, ask!" Melin shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you from the </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Police Department? What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm police officer Melin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you come alone? Where are the others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin hesitated before answering. "I came alone because my boss was afraid to get involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen snorted and placed the blade on Melin's bra strap, suddenly cutting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin cried out, and her full chest was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with Rosen and his men's wild laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, now it's time for our welcome party." Rosen ripped off the black cloth covering her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wicked smile, he started to unbuckle his belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you going to do? I'm a police officer. Don't come near me!" Melin was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her looks and figure were top-notch, and many men pursued her, both at work and in life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already preserved her chastity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, facing these thugs, she felt hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen walked up to Melin, smiling wickedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin looked up at him fiercely. "You've probably done this to other women before, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're quite fierce!" Rosen grabbed Melin's chin and said, "Officer, it's too late now. If you serve me well, maybe I'll spare your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you touch me, I'll kill you," Melin warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, who was secretly watching, suddenly realized that Melin's demeanor was completely different from before. He wondered if she had hidden her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, you're trying to scare me?" Rosen laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unzipped his pants and pushed Melin's head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin suddenly sprang up and headbutted Rosen in the groin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen screamed in pain and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin's arms twisted, moving from behind her back to the front, but the handcuffs still bound her wrists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All this happened in a flash. When everyone came to their senses, she had already picked up the dagger and was holding it to Rosen's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell your men to back off, or I'll kill you!" she threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but cheer, not expecting Melin to pretend to be weak and then strike at the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Melin underestimated these men's fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone pointed a gun at Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others held guns or knives to the Fairfax family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen laughed, "Capturing me is useless. Everyone, listen up! Kill one person every </span><span>ten seconds until she lets me go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was at a loss. In this situation, even killing Rosen wouldn't help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosen sneered, "Aren't you a police officer? Don't you want to save them? Now their lives are in your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, screams filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Fairfax family member was stabbed in the thigh and fell to the ground, writhing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Melin shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stabbed Rosen's thigh with the dagger.</span></p></div>
