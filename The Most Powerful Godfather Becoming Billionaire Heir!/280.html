        <h1>Chapter 280 The Hero</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda quickly chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, hurry up and kneel to apologize to the General! If he gets mad, you won't be able to handle the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion shouted at Alexander, "Alexander, what did you just say? How dare you accuse the General of colluding with bandits! This is the Hansen Villa, and I won't allow you to behave so outrageously here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander ignored Andrew and Belinda, instead turning to Orion with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not the head of the Hansen family, so what gives you the right to speak for them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was furious, ready to hurl insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara said loudly, "Mr. Hawthorne and Ms. Blackburn are honored guests and deserve the proper respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was momentarily speechless, only managing to glare fiercely at Lara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder snapped, "All of you, shut up and get out of my sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Andrew and the others were frustrated and furious; despite siding with Schroder, he didn't seem to appreciate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder, his face dark, walked toward Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his black military boots clacking against the marble floor echoed sharply, as if striking everyone's hearts in the quiet room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a high-ranking military officer, he exuded authority, along with a distinct aura of deadly resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Schroder had lost an elite squad, the dozen or so men behind him were all seasoned special forces, battle-hardened and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder stopped two feet in front of Alexander. Their gazes locked, neither backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I'm informing you that the military has requisitioned the magic powder as a strategic reserve. Starting today, the Saint Group is prohibited from selling it, and you must hand over the formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your last chance. If you cooperate, I'll overlook what happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise... don't blame me for being harsh!" Schroder huffed angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The special forces behind him stepped forward in unison, exuding a menacing aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava was instantly anxious upon hearing that the military wanted to seize the magic powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, however, remained completely calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"General, if the military really requisitioned it, show me the official order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there isn't one, then it seems someone is impersonating the military to issue false </span><span>orders for personal gain, which is a serious offense punishable in military court."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder's face turned livid. He hadn't expected Alexander to publicly question his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seizure of the magic powder had nothing to do with the military; it was purely Schroder's own greed. He assumed Alexander lacked any powerful connections, so he fabricated the military's involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Schroder assumed a menacing posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, how dare you question the military's orders? You have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to the middle-aged man with a buzz cut standing behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Colonel Mitchell, don't you see this man trying to humiliate me? You're my old subordinates. Are you just going to stand there and watch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob stepped forward swiftly, saluting respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The General's authority must not be violated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> his eyes filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I suggest you apologize to the General immediately. Don't defy the military's orders, or I'll have to deal with you myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the shining medals on Jacob's chest, the crowd couldn't help but gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those are top-tier honor medals! This Colonel is a war hero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haven't you heard the story of the 'Lone Hero'? That's Colonel Mitchell! He once single-handedly took down an entire platoon of terrorists..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! I heard he's trained in combat for over 20 years. His fists are like iron. He can crush a man's skull with a single punch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, is that for real? Alexander is in serious danger this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd whispered among themselves, growing excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them were eager to watch the drama unfold. Though they knew Alexander was skilled, facing a hero like Jacob seemed certain to end in disaster.</span></p></div>
