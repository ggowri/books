        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felix and I were already sworn enemies. If they want a war, I'll just wipe their influence off the island entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I'll rally our people right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe, inspired by Alexander's resolve, replied eagerly, confident since the Brilliant Group dominated Treasure Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander waved her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. The Red Umbrella Group may not be strong here, but still dangerous. Start by clearing out any spies on the inside, like that suspicious butler Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I get back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, I'll send Augusta over with backup for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander always worked carefully, never taking action without certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the Hansen family was about to hold a family meeting to announce the next head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Orion was already under house arrest, Alexander sensed that Rebecca would </span><span>still face challenges in securing her position as heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cloe looked a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, you're going back to </span><span>Loscity</span><span> so soon?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled her close, giving her a playful squeeze as he said with a smile, "Don't worry, I'll make sure you're satisfied before I leave for </span><span>Loscity</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Cloe felt a shiver run through her, and she melted against Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was waiting anxiously at </span><span>Loscity</span><span> Airport, pacing back and forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heels clicked on the floor, her figure moving rhythmically as she walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her full figure drew glances from men nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander walked out from the terminal, waving at her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, surprised and delighted, rushed over, hugging him tightly, pressing herself close as if she wanted to meld with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, please...please save my grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca pleaded, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's smile vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? I thought his condition was under control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He collapsed again and is in shock; the doctors say he's in critical condition...it's Orion's doing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scumbag Orion is working with the Clifford family, trying to force me to marry their young master and let them take over my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca cried as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed with deadly resolve. Orion had teamed up with the Federer family, and now he'd joined forces with the Clifford family. There had to be someone powerful helping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion deserves to be punished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Clifford family want to play with fire, I'll ensure they know. They won't just get burned; they'll be incinerated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go save your grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca wiped her tears, kissed Alexander twice on the cheek, and pulled him toward her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men watched enviously, glaring at Alexander with jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander got into Rebecca's Porsche, buckled her seatbelt, and pressed the gas pedal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red Porsche shot forward like a speeding bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche weaved skillfully through heavy traffic, passing car after car with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're an amazing driver; so fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was amazed, gripping the handle tightly despite the seatbelt, feeling both exhilarated and thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rescuing someone is like putting out a fire. Your grandfather is family to me, so of course, I have to go all out," Alexander replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moved by his words, Rebecca couldn't hold back her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Alexander. I'm with you for life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca vowed earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly navigated through the city, reaching a four-lane road with little traffic, allowing him to accelerate even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Porsche's engine growled, bringing them closer to the Hansen family home. Rebecca began to tremble with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alexander by her side, Rebecca felt completely confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vroom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud engine roar echoed from behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced in the rearview mirror to see a blue Lamborghini speeding up from behind, clearly trying to overtake them.</span></p></div>
