        <h1>Chapter 103 Negotiation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alexander!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment Ava spotted him, she rushed over with enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, she was dressed to impress in a sleek black Chanel suit paired with a crisp white shirt and just a hint of makeup that exuded both elegance and allure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Memories of last night's candlelit dinner flooded her mind, and she felt her cheeks flush as she recalled waking up bare in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm here to pick you up. Let's go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander grinned. "Are you planning another candlelit dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he wrapped his arm around Ava's waist and planted a kiss on her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava pushed him away playfully, feeling a mix of shyness and excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they were in the car, Ava filled him in on the latest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca would be bringing the Hansen family to negotiate, and they were gearing up to seize the initiative at tomorrow's conference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along with Rebecca, the heiress of the Hansen family, there was Orion Hansen, Rebecca's cousin and the one currently holding the reins of power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava continued, her tone serious, "According to reliable intel, the real mastermind behind the magic powder will be there tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian is definitely going to try to snatch that formula. No matter what, we can't let him succeed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she adjusted Alexander's collar, her hands deftly smoothing out any wrinkles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, he won't get the formula," Alexander replied confidently, a smile spreading across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava raised an eyebrow, saying, "It's great that you're confident, but Rebecca is coming to negotiate mainly because of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, please, don't start any arguments with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander nodded, his expression turning serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, they arrived at the Saint Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hand in hand, they walked into the meeting room, where they immediately spotted a burly man in a sharp suit lounging on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His intense gaze was fixed on Alexander and Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander's eyes first landed on Rebecca, who huffed and turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then his attention shifted to the man, who exuded a calm, powerful presence&mdash;clearly no slouch in the strength department, likely on par with Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hansen, this is my boyfriend, Alexander," Ava introduced warmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion remained seated, showing no intention of standing up to shake hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I've heard your boyfriend's quite the fighter, but looking at him, he seems a bit... underwhelming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he flexed his massive biceps, clearly trying to intimidate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In response to Orion's provocation, Alexander simply smiled and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava felt her irritation rise; Orion was being downright rude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, to her surprise, Alexander extended his hand toward Orion. "Mr. Hansen, it's a pleasure to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion paused, clearly caught off guard by Alexander's boldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As their hands clasped, Orion squeezed tightly, hoping to embarrass Alexander in front of Ava.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With two decades of boxing and strength training behind him, he was confident this pretty boy would wince in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the next moment, Orion was stunned. No matter how hard he gripped, it was as if his strength had vanished into thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alexander remained calm, even managing a smirk that suggested he wasn't fazed at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hansen, why the death grip? This is my hand, not a gym weight." Alexander chuckled, casually shaking off Orion's hold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a surge of Force emanated from Alexander, sending Orion crashing to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca rushed over to help Orion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She asked, her voice laced with anger, "Alexander, what's the meaning of this? Were you trying to ambush him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion's face turned crimson. He had been the one to provoke, yet here he was, humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, it's fine. This guy actually has some strength. Maybe we can talk about a collaboration," Orion said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca blinked in surprise. Orion was known for his arrogance, and she hadn't expected him to acknowledge Alexander's abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion continued, his tone shifting, "However, I have a small request. If Ms. Blackburn wants to partner with the Hansen family, well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ava sensed trouble brewing and cautiously asked, "Mr. Hansen, what do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Orion straightened his suit, adopting a faux polite demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Blackburn, I've always admired you. Given this opportunity for our collaboration, would you consider being my girlfriend?"</p></div>
