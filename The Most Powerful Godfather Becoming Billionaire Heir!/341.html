        <h1>Chapter 341 Top Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Quentin was a stranger to Madelyn and Avery, they knew Dawson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really Mr. Myers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Beautiful ladies, don't you welcome me?" Dawson asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. We are honored. Welcome, Mr. Myers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn was so excited that she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery was even more at a loss. She glanced at Alexander in shock and was impressed by him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expressed his gratitude to Quentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said seriously, "You are the savior of the Thompson family. You don't need to thank me. I am not afraid of Caleb. If he dares to come, I will teach him a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Avery were taken aback. Judging from his tone, he must be an important figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly introduced, "This is Mr. Thompson, a four-star general in the Northern Command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn and Avery were dumbfounded. Their sexy red lips opened in an O shape, and they didn't close their mouths for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson was already a big shot in their eyes, and now even a four-star general could be summoned by Alexander with just a phone call. It was really astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson asked kindly, "Ms. Price, I heard that you want to unfreeze some funds, right? Hand the materials to my secretary, and she will unfreeze them for you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Thank you, Mr. Myers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madelyn's face flushed with excitement, and she stared at Alexander with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Quentin took out the broken necklace and said apologetically, "Mr. Hawthorne, you forgot to take the necklace with you. I'm so sorry that such a pretty lucky charm was damaged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the necklace, Dawson suddenly lost control and trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snatched the necklace away and observed the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern on the broken gem with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin frowned and said unhappily, "Dawson, what's wrong with you? It belongs to Mr. Hawthorne. I'm here to return it to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson ignored him and concentrated on stroking the gem excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked at him curiously, wondering what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Dawson asked cautiously, "Mr. Hawthorne, is it the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern on this gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exclaimed in surprise, "Mr. Myers, do you know the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson became even more excited and stuttered, "Mr. Hawthorne, do you know an elderly man named James Rutherford?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes. After pondering for a few seconds, he nodded affirmatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am Mr. Rutherford's pupil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson's expression at once became extremely complex, betraying shock, excitement, thrill, joy, and so on.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin asked, "Dawson, what are you trying to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dawson whispered in his ear tremblingly, "The Warriors... Mr. Rutherford is the last survivor among them. Alexander is his pupil, and he must have inherited his power. Otherwise, he could never have carved the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, I wanted to become Mr. Rutherford's disciple, but was rejected by him. However, I can recognize the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern. I'm sure I'm right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was bowled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Information about the Warriors was top secret in the military, and even he didn't have access to all of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only knew that more than fifty years ago, a Warrior named James came to Earth. Unexpectedly, Alexander was actually his pupil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, did Mr. Rutherford teach the </span><span>Spellweave</span><span> Pattern?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin was so thrilled that his voice was trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he did. Any questions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander exuded a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin quickly explained, "Mr. Hawthorne, please don't misunderstand. We admire Mr. Rutherford very much. More than fifty years ago, he saved mankind from a catastrophe, but in the end, he disappeared. The military has been looking for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander froze. He was only in his twenties and was unaware of the secrets from decades ago.</span></p></div>
