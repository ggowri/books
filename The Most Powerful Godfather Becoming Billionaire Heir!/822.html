        <h1>Chapter 822 Special Powers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander remained calm and waited for her action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two entered the store; Sofia immediately locked the door and then ran in to get the perfume.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, she came over with a beautifully packaged box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander frowned because he smelled a peculiar fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this special fragrance emanated from Sofia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This fragrance had a strong aphrodisiac effect. As soon as Alexander smelled it, he immediately felt the desire, and his crotch tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the way he looked at Sofia changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander suddenly felt that her appearance and figure were the most beautiful and sexiest women he had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ava couldn't compare to her. She seemed like a rare treasure, extremely dazzling, or like the sweetest fruit, which would drip out tempting water if pinched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia's eyes were seductive. She bit her red lips lightly, stuck out her pink tongue, and licked between the two sexy lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a trace of saliva on her tongue and lips, as if she was eager for a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sir, you are so handsome..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia pouted and took the initiative to snuggle up to Alexander and throw herself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mysterious fragrance became stronger and stronger, rushing straight into Alexander's nose, arousing the irrepressible desire deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Sofia saw Alexander staring at her with eyes wide open and obsessed, she immediately smiled triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a metahuman with special powers. She thought she was superior, so she looked down on ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not until she recognized Alexander, who happened to be her mission's target, that she used her special powers, emitting a unique aphrodisiac body fragrance to seduce Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This strange fragrance was Sofia's special ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although this special power couldn't be used to kill people, it was very strange and could be quite effective when used on men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Sofia was full of confidence. She believed that Alexander was a normal man and would be obsessed with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The special ability had a strong aphrodisiac effect, and men would be completely obsessed with it once they tasted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The degree of obsession was dozens or hundreds of times stronger than drug addiction, and it was impossible to get rid of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Alexander would hand over the formula of magic powder or all his secrets and wealth without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia smiled happily with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as she completed this mission, she would be able to become the vice president of the Sakura Society, and from then on, she would be in a high position with a bright future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, Alexander was so handsome, and she also wanted to have a taste of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was wondering why Alexander didn't pounce on her. According to common sense, any man aroused by her special powers would pounce on her like a hungry beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia didn't think that Alexander could still stay sober. He must have been confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, baby!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed Alexander's hand and pressed it against her plump breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Sofia felt a sharp pain in her neck and was pinched by Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia stared at Alexander in shock. The smug smile on her face disappeared, replaced by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your aphrodisiac ability is indeed strange, but you are just a level-one metahuman, so you are not capable of turning me on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you advance to level five, or even above, maybe you can confuse me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander gave a grim smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a little scared, as he was indeed affected just now, but it only took a few seconds for him to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Sofia had taken the opportunity to attack him, she might have succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander slowly tightened his five fingers and said, "Tell me, who are you? What is your purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was murderous intent in his tone, and his eyes were cold and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a metahuman who could seduce men was a disaster no matter what!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia couldn't breathe in enough oxygen, so she struggled desperately, digging into Alexander's fingers with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander threw her to the ground like trash until she was about to faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huff!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sofia took deep gulps of the hard-earned oxygen and trembled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, she wanted to find an opportunity to use her beauty to get out of the predicament, but Alexander was merciless, so it didn't work.</span></p></div>
