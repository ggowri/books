        <h1>Chapter 1334 The Fighting Fanatic</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius's eyebrow twitched as his face cycled through several shades of anger. "Sellers Schneier," he spat, "don't think having the Minister of Defense as your old man means I won't touch you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers burst out laughing. "Ha! Ask anyone. When have I ever backed down from a fight? Since that's how you want to play it, Alexander and I will take you on together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" Julius choked on his words, his chest heaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Sellers' gold-tipped spear and then thought about Alexander's reputation. The odds weren't in his favor today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Julius gave them a nasty smile. "Fine. Alexander, Sellers, I won't forget this. One of these days..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left the threat hanging and stormed off with his followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smirk. "Yeah, don't let the door hit you on the way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd started buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, that young man's got skills for someone so young!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No joke. He's probably already at the peak of Level Two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Julius walked away, Alexander rushed over to greet the handsome young man in white. "Hey, thanks for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers' eyes lit up as he clapped Alexander on the shoulder. "That piece of trash? Not even worth mentioning. Dude, my dad told me you're some kind of prodigy. I can totally see it now. We should spar sometime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander rolled his eyes. "Great, another fighting junkie," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, they sat in the training yard sporting matching black eyes and bruised faces, casually chatting after their impromptu match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander hadn't mastered Dragonhell Staff yet, they'd stuck to hand-to-hand. It had been a proper brawl&mdash;trading punches and kicks, each landing their fair share of hits to faces and ribs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey Sellers," Alexander asked, gingerly touching his black eye, "how come Julius gets away with having that whole crew following him around in the outer district?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sellers winced as he touched his swollen face. "They're not really his crew. Just some older students who figured they weren't gonna advance any further in their training. They basically sold out and became muscle for guys like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch yourself around them," he added seriously. "They might be sellouts, but they're experienced fighters who know what they're doing. Julius won't mess with me directly, but he's the type to hold grudges. He's definitely gonna try to get back at you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave Sellers a formal bow. "Thanks for looking out for me, man. You're a real one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dude, you made quite a scene today," Sellers laughed. "People are definitely gonna be looking for you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day was winding down, so Alexander said goodbye to his new friend and headed back to his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't notice that Kenny, the short guy, had been tailing Alexander the whole time. Julius had given him strict orders&mdash;keep a close eye on Alexander and wait for the perfect moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Alexander walked through the courtyard gates, Clyde hurried over. "Mr. Hawthorne, we received quite a few invitation cards this afternoon. I've left them all in the living room. Dinner's ready too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander waved him off with a smile. "Thanks for your hard work. Go get some rest. I'll call if I need anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clyde headed to his room, Alexander made his way to the living room, where the large wooden table was loaded with food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spread was impressive&mdash;various protein-rich meats, complex carbs, fresh vegetables, and some carefully selected fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clyde really knows how to take care of people," Alexander thought, appreciating how well the butler understood his tastes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since becoming a level-two warrior, his appetite had skyrocketed. Scholars lived cheap, but warriors ate like kings. The food costs alone for someone training in combat arts would bankrupt most households.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander started going through the invitation cards while eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the Iron Vanguard: Enclosed please find a gift of a thousand coins in celebration of Mr. Alexander Hawthorne's advancement to the Outer Circle of the Dominion Church..." he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invitations had rolled in from all the major players&mdash;Four Seas Agency, Pacific Trading Coalition, Dragon Academy, Elite School, and both the Hrodvik Business Alliance and Treasury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These guys had eyes and ears everywhere. Sellers was right. The moment they spotted Alexander's potential, the recruitment letters started flooding in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't about to jump into bed with any faction just yet. Building up his own power had to come first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Alexander counted up all the "welcome gifts" they'd sent. The cheapest was five hundred coins, the most generous was two grand, adding up to over 20 thousand in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help grinning as he shuffled through the stack of bank notes. Call him greedy, but this was perfect timing. He'd been stressing about how to fund his training at both Manual House and Treasure House. That kind of advanced instruction didn't come cheap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bone-compression technique Alexander noticed on Manual House's third floor had been solid, but he was bummed about not having enough virtue points or coins to really make use of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his bedroom, Alexander carefully stashed the bank notes and lost himself in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd maxed out level-two warrior, but reaching level-three meant mastering both meridian channels and projecting his Force energy outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's got to be a way to speed up this progression to level-three," he thought, stroking his chin. Today's close call was still fresh in his mind. If Sellers hadn't stepped up to help, things could've gone south real quick. Raw power was crucial in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Alexander started practicing Muscle-Tendon Classic, drawing in the ambient energy and converting it into pure power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he finished the sequence, he let out a long exhale, feeling the tension leave his chest. He had to admit that his muscles and bones felt stronger every day. That golden energy in his chest was something else.</span></p></div>
