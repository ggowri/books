        <h1>Chapter 1157 Just Kidding</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the villa, in the garden, there was a standard outdoor swimming pool surrounded by lush flowers, creating a picturesque scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was perfect, with clear skies, white clouds, and bright sunshine. It was a beautiful day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sank into a lounge chair, sipping juice and humming a cheerful tune, completely relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ava and Lynn changed into their bikinis, Alexander's eyes widened in surprise, his body stiffening with sudden tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two beauties had incredibly seductive figures. Their flawless, voluptuous bodies were curvaceous, and their perfect legs made heads spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alexander's intense gaze, Ava and Lynn walked hand-in-hand into the pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked like two beautiful mermaids from a fairytale, gliding through the crystal-clear water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in high spirits and started a water fight. Water splashed everywhere as they giggled and laughed, their joy adding to the already stunning scenery. Alexander's hormones surged in response, and he couldn't help but feel stirred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Water fight? I want to join in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Rebecca also jumped into the pool. The three stunning beauties splashed around playfully, turning the pool into a chaotic scene of laughter and fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander felt thirsty and took large gulps of juice, his eyes never leaving them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the three beauties grew tired of their play. Ava and Lynn left the pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava waved at Alexander, saying, "Mom and I are going to prepare lunch. You guys play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked, "Didn't you say other guests would be arriving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava smiled and gave him a teasing look, "Are you that gullible? I told you there </span><span>would be other guests, but actually, it's just the four of us today. We were just messing with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was speechless. Had he known this earlier, he would have jumped into the pool and had some fun with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava and Lynn walked away hand in hand. Lynn leaned in to whisper something in Ava's ear, causing Ava's face to turn bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Rebecca made a funny face at Alexander, slightly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, of course, understood that Ava leaving meant they were being given some private time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned at Rebecca and then patted the lounge chair beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Ava and Lynn had gone, Rebecca left the pool and sat down beside Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes roamed over her alluring figure, growing even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bikini clung to Rebecca's fiery figure, droplets of water dotting her smooth, pale skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The water sparkled under the sunlight, tracing the curves of her body, flowing from top to bottom, accentuating her shapely backside and long legs, making her irresistibly seductive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you missed me recently?" Alexander asked with a playful smile, already feeling a surge of excitement within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you who must have missed me," Rebecca shot him a teasing glance while reaching for a towel to dry off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movements of her body as she wiped herself down only drew more attention, making Alexander struggle to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander's intense gaze, Rebecca couldn't help but feel a sense of delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing more satisfying than seeing her beloved man so captivated by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what gift did you prepare for me?" Rebecca's eyes sparkled, locked onto him with an unreadable expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A gift? Ahem, sorry..." Alexander cleared his throat awkwardly, trying to cover up his embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I promise you. Today is your big day, the day you move into your new home. You're the most important. Whatever gift you want, as long as I have it, it's yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I can have anything I want?" Rebecca's eyes gleamed mischievously, full of playful intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... I suppose that's fine. You can tell me what you want," Alexander hesitated for a moment, gathering the courage to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to marry me. How about that?" Rebecca leaned in closer to Alexander, her expression one of coy amusement, like a sly little fox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Alexander was completely stunned. He scratched his head, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca leaned in even closer, her delicate fragrance overwhelming him. Her flawless body was so near that Alexander could almost feel the warmth of her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed hard, forcing a smile as he stammered, "Rebecca, you're just joking with me, right? I'm not thinking about marriage right now. How about you pick </span><span>something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You can't handle it. You said I could have anything I want, but I knew that you can't let go of Ava."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca gave Alexander a playful but forceful pinch before rolling her eyes at him. Pouting, she angrily sat back down on the lounge chair.</span></p></div>
