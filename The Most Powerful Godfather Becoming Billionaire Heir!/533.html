        <h1>Chapter 533 Being Disliked</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The charm between Nancy's eyes seemed to emanate from her bones, and just one look from her could make a man restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if one wanted to get close to her, he would find her very cold and aloof, keeping people at a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combination of these two extreme temperaments made Nancy a popular woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander secretly sighed that Nancy was indeed a vixen but was still a virgin. It was unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you have to be with Nancy as soon as possible. This way, not only will Ashley be saved, but the Kaylon will also become your most solid ally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany urged enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help laughing and said, "Aren't you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany grabbed his crotch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I not be jealous? But I want to save Ashley and help you defeat that </span><span>bastard</span><span> Felix!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, Ashley could only survive a month at most. Felix was now in alliance with the Morris family, and his strength couldn't be underestimated. It was still unknown what difficulties were waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was not afraid, he couldn't underestimate the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Brittany giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought that you would be disliked. Nancy is awesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was unhappy because Nancy was indeed the first woman to reject him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling was like being slapped in the face, and it also aroused his competitive spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, I heard that there are signs of internal unrest in the Kaylon recently, so you can start from this aspect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded and stared at Nancy on the stage with burning eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt it immediately and looked at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their eyes met, Nancy's face suddenly turned red, and her body trembled inexplicably. She felt that she had no secrets in the eyes of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rhythm of her DJing suddenly became disrupted, and she quickly turned around, her heart beating fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander used All-seeing Eyes to see through Nancy's clothes and admire her naked body. She was so beautiful and sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but react, and his crotch felt extremely tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hand was put on Brittany's thigh, which gradually moved inside...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you are so bad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany's body trembled, and she moaned as she snuggled in Alexander's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy came down from the stage and saw Brittany's flushed cheeks and rapid breathing, and she immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany, what's wrong with you? Are you sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany turned her head and looked at Alexander, with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Alexander, then at Brittany, and scanned Alexander with a puzzled and vigilant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had already withdrawn his hand and was looking at Nancy without avoiding, looking calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was nervous, as she had seen many lecherous men and also many men who played hard to get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she could tell from Alexander's eyes and expression that he was different from other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other and were silent as if they were competing to see who was colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Nancy couldn't help but ask first, "Have a drink? Everyone who comes is a guest. I'll buy you a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled slightly and said, "I will help you solve the internal strife of the Kaylon, and you will be my woman, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brittany told you, right? Do you think you can get me this way? But I do have plans to find a man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she picked up the glass and drank it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander calmly filled her glass of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to get drunk, then take advantage of me?" Nancy looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took a sip of wine and said calmly, "If I wanted to take advantage of you, you would have been in bed by now. Don't worry, I won't force you if you don't want to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy sneered contemptuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are indeed a strange person, more interesting than other men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When saying this, Nancy seemed to glance at Brittany unintentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany blushed immediately. It was obvious that Nancy had guessed that Brittany and Alexander had a special relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said very seriously, "Tell me, what hidden dangers does the Kaylon have? Tell me, and I will help you solve them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy said nothing and shook her glass. "Another one!"</span></p></div>
