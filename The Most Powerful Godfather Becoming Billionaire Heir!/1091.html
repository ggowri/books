        <h1>Chapter 1091 Talking about Business</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside was a small hall of about 1000 square feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two men were sitting on the sofa in the center. One of them was a fat man in his forties with a pair of puffy eyes, which had dark circles. It was obvious that he was a guy addicted to alcohol and sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other was an old man with gray hair. He was thin, but his face was fat. He was puffing on a cigar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them was accompanied by a scantily clad young woman who was sensual and pretty, clinging to them intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fat man was reporting something to the old man, while both of them groped the women greedily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander heard the fat man say, "Thomas, we must obtain the technology of the All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jacket, with which the Silver Shield Security can move up to a higher level and become a large international company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Carlo, don't worry. We'll have the technology. I contacted the military. As long as we get the technology, we can become their partner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By that time, who will dare to mess with Silver Shield Security?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fat guy named Carlo Cohen also laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Mafia will restore the strength soon. We'll send more people to Newbrook, and Silver Shield Security will move to a higher level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas nodded in satisfaction. "Very good. I hope so... SATAN was unlucky to get involved with the Sakra Society. It's not surprising that he was oppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the Apocalypse Project concerns eternity. If I have the chance to get in touch with it, I will join it without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo sighed and said, "Yes, our Godfather is now keeping a low profile. A new leaf has been turned slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'd better think about something happy. As long as we have the technology to make All-purpose Bullet-resistant Jackets, we will make a fortune..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of it, they both laughed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alvin and his daughter are in my hands. They can't escape. If he doesn't hand over the technology, he will end up miserably."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas boasted proudly, grabbing the woman's breasts and squeezing them hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensual woman almost cried at the pain, but she endured it and forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo bit the plump breasts of the woman next to him and then said viciously, "If you need help, tell me, and I'll gather my men immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas instantly deepened his smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't need your help. Alvin and his daughter are like ants on the ground. I can crush them at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you? I want to see who the ant is on the ground."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander pushed open the door and entered the room leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodyguards were scattered on the ground outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked. When the nearby bodyguards came to their senses, they stood up immediately and stared at Alexander fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas waved his hand to stop his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed the murderous aura from Alexander and saw the bodyguards lying motionless on the ground outside. He was certain the young man in front of him was definitely not simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brat, did you take Alvin away from the bar?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Thomas asked, he looked Alexander up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I did. Hand over Alvin and Maxine, and we can discuss a business deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander went up to Thomas calmly, ignoring the aggressive bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas glared at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carlo wore a ferocious expression with murderous air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander sat down on the sofa casually and crossed his legs, looking at the two of them indifferently and saying, "I saw Jordan just now. He gave me all his shares of Silver Shield Security for free, so I'm an important shareholder of your company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thomas slammed the table with anger and jumped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you harm my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly took out his cell phone and called Jordan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alexander said with a smile, "Don't waste your time. Your son is stupid and naive now. He's an idiot who can't even answer the phone."</span></p></div>
