        <h1>Chapter 373 Double Gains</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph struck his cane down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I adopted you; you're not blood-related to the Hansen family. Am I wrong for not passing the family head position to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Orion was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm adopted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should never have adopted you back then. This is all my fault, cough, cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph was too furious to stand, and others rushed to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's expression was complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca spoke coldly, "We all knew you were adopted, but Grandpa didn't want us to tell you so you wouldn't feel burdened. And yet you went and poisoned him. Do you even count as human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion stared blankly for a moment, then suddenly began yelling like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it! This is all lies. You just want Rebecca to become the family head, so you're smearing me, pretending I'm adopted. Isn't </span><span>that</span><span> right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph and Rebecca were both speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander shook his head. "He's gone crazy over wanting to be the head. Even God couldn't save someone like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander! Shut up. No one asked for your opinion, </span><span>you</span><span> useless leech living off women..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander could move, Rebecca slapped him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slapped him again with her other hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack, smack, smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron was pummeled by Rebecca's slaps until he couldn't stand, collapsing into a heap on the floor. His eyes were so swollen they were barely slits, his face unrecognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was silent, everyone shocked by how hard Rebecca had hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Ralph lifted Rebecca's hand high, announcing to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm old and no longer up to the task. I need a long period of rest. From today forward, Rebecca is the head of the Hansen family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was silent; no one had expected Ralph to step down so directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the room erupted in applause and cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's face was flushed with excitement as she looked at Alexander with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the crowd, she would've rushed into Alexander's arms, kissing him and offering herself to show her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, thank you for saving me twice now. I don't know how to repay you. I'll leave Rebecca in your care from now on," Ralph said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ralph bowed deeply to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he asked Alexander to take good care of Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew what this meant, and they couldn't help but envy Alexander; he was truly blessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he with Ava, the CEO of the Saint Group, but now even the head of the Hansen family was his lover. Double the gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin quickly grew concerned, pulling Alexander aside to whisper, "Alexander, don't forget, Brittany has been thinking about you this whole time! Don't forget about her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was torn between laughing and crying and could only nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Hansen Villa, Alexander hurried to the Saint Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca wanted to go with him, but as the new head of the family, she had too many things to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander couldn't help but smile. He hadn't told Ava he was back in </span><span>Loscity</span><span>, planning to surprise her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could already imagine how excited Ava would be to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Alexander arrived at Ava's office door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Saint Group employees greeted him respectfully, watching him with admiration and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The office door was closed tight. Before he got too close, Alexander could already hear arguing inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You're not allowed in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four men in black suddenly jumped out, blocking Alexander's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not with the Saint Group, are you?" Alexander asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead man chuckled mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, stay out of this and scram, or you'll end up like that woman over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to the hallway corner, where Ava's assistant lay unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, a sharp killing intent flashing within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, what are you doing? Is this how you protect Ms. Blackburn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, William dropped down from the ceiling with agile precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash of his blade, William struck, and two of the men clutched their bleeding throats, collapsing in terror.</span></p></div>
