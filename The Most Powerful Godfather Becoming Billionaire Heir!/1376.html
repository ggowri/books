        <h1>Chapter 1376 Audacious Bastards</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they weren't forced into anything illegal, the servants would remain absolutely loyal and never betray them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's test proved it. It really worked! As for the silver waist token, Alexander stored it in his Dimensional pouch. Only he could open it, making it completely secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Josh, I'm sure the treasure from Tiger Gang is well hidden, so there's no rush. Go find your son and spend some time with him. Get some rest for the next few days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander saw how badly Josh had been beaten and told him to take a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh's face was filled with gratitude. He bowed respectfully, thanked Alexander, and left with the nearby manor guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan scratched his head. "Alexander, can we really trust this guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded firmly. "As long as we don't do anything shady, he won't betray us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rubbed his head, grinning with excitement. "That's great! A level-four warrior at our service? I've got a top-tier bodyguard now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, Alexander, Logan, Josh, and his son, Ivan, set off for Tiger Gang with a few manor guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronghold was deep in Oxhead Mountain, nearly ten thousand miles from Darwin. When Josh led his men to attack Kean Manor, they scattered and traveled through relay stations, using Teleportation Plates to reach Darwin. The journey cost them tens of thousands of coins and took several days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ox-Head Mountain spanned a thousand miles, its terrain treacherous. It was filled with bandit hideouts and had long been a primary target for Hrodvik's military crackdowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiger Gang was nestled deep in the mountains. With a level-four warrior as its leader, no one dared to challenge its authority within a hundred-mile radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two more days of travel, they arrived at the Tiger Gang, a fortress that was easy to defend but difficult to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steep cliffs and deep ravines surrounded the place, with a narrow winding path stretching for miles leading up to the gates. The walls were built from massive logs and large stones, sturdy enough to withstand a siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fortress had lookout holes and arrow slits, all the proper defenses. Yet, not a single guard was on duty. The main gate stood wide open, with only a black flag bearing the character "Tiger" fluttering in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh led the group inside, only to find the place in complete disarray. Clothes, bedding, weapons, and miscellaneous junk were strewn all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should have been a stronghold now looked like a pigsty. Dozens of bandits sat around in groups, drinking and gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh was furious. His blood boiled as he roared, "Are you all trying to die?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bandits turned around in shock. The leader and young master they thought would never return were standing right there. Panicked and excited, they quickly tossed aside their bottles and gambling pieces and rushed over to bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the middle-aged lieutenants knelt and cried out, "Boss, we thought you weren't coming back! A lot of guys ran off. The Sacred Spirit Gang sent word that they're taking over tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh's eyes widened in rage. "What?! Those bastards have some nerve! Don't worry about them. Mr. Hawthorne will see to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Hawthorne? Did the boss pledge allegiance to someone? The bandits looked at each other, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ivan barked out orders. "Clean up this mess! Get a feast ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They entered the war room. Alexander sat at the head chair, a grand wooden seat draped with a tiger pelt. It was surprisingly soft and comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone settled in, Alexander frowned and asked, "Josh, what is this Sacred Spirit Gang? Does it have ties to the Risunese cult, Sacred Spirit Order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josh pondered for a moment before replying in a grave tone,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne, the Sacred Spirit Gang appeared in Ox-Head Mountain three years ago and has been growing like wildfire. Both of their leaders are Risunese. I'd bet anything they're linked to the Sacred Spirit Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned ice-cold as he nodded. "Check how many men we have left by tonight and get things in order. Since they think you're not coming back, let's give them a little surprise tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne." Josh and Ivan bowed before leaving to make preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan rubbed his head and scoffed. "Alexander, those bastards are everywhere. Looks like they've got bad intentions for Hrodvik."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a sinister chuckle. "We were born too late to fight in the war, but now that we're in Sahasia, we can use them to sharpen our blades!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan laughed foolishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At dawn the next day, a group of riders made their way up the rugged mountain path toward Tiger Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was a tall, gaunt man in his forties. He had a long braided queue, sharp, slanted eyebrows, beady triangular eyes, and a thin mustache. He wore a black robe with a pink outer layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A palm-sized circular emblem was stitched onto his robe, with the word "Kill" written in the center. He walked with his hands clasped behind his back, his slow strides oddly swift.</span></p></div>
