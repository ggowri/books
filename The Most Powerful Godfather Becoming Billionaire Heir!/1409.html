        <h1>Chapter 1409 Survival Crisis</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you still have such a powerful force!" A flash of panic crossed Frieza's eyes. Suddenly, he roared, "You forced me! I'll show you what extreme despair is! Second-stage transformation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza lowered his body, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and clenched his strange hands. He let out strange yells, and scarlet flames steamed up from his body, with deep-red electric arcs flashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frieza roared. His large, square head became long and narrow, resembling the body of a fat beetle. He had a scarlet frog-like mouth. The ox horns on his head disappeared, and several ferocious spikes stood on his back, shoulders, and head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! Their internal energy is rising rapidly!" Alexander was shocked. He exerted all his might and rushed towards the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Erica chanted, countless sacred hymns sounded in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world suddenly brightened. The pillar of radiance became even more massive and sacred as if there was a sacred pillar between the earth and the heaven. An endless, magnificent holy radiance poured down rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even the endless dark clouds were forcefully dispelled by this holy radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this extremely sacred radiance, Erica's slender and graceful figure emerged. Six wings behind her sparkled with silver-white holy light. Her long, golden hair fluttered, her skin was so tender, and her deep blue eyes were bright. She stood barefoot, holding a cross scepter in her left hand and a horn in her right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Erica was quivering all over. She said weakly, "Doomsday Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gabryl, the sovereign of judgment in the pillar of radiance, stared intently at Frieza with his deep and cold eyes. Erica blew the horn in her right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint horn sound rang out. In an instant, thunderclouds rolled in the sky, and the lightning was dazzling. Soon, countless huge and sacred lightning bolts struck Frieza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, a black mushroom cloud hundreds of feet high rose into the air, mixed with endless surging lightning bolts. The ground cracked, mountains collapsed, and tornadoes formed...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, in the underground research center, Yinson had an evil smile as he looked at Alexander, who was sleeping in the nutrient tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yinson never expected that Alexander would burst out with powerful potential in the fantasy world Yinson constructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Precisely because of Alexander's explosive potential, the changes in his body structure and cell mutations were captured by Yinson with the most advanced equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through research and replication, the combat power of beasts and living dead, including the zombie army, was greatly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This terrifying power, which Alexander kept murmuring about in his dream, was called "the Force".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just half a year, they had already occupied ninety percent of the world's land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the command center, there was a cloud of smoke and a hubbub of voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph Mead, the commander-in-chief, slapped the table hard and shouted, "Quiet! Anyone who dares to talk will be dragged out and shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone in the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph frowned and waved his hand, saying, "Open the windows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Several guards quickly opened the windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the current power shortage, in order to save electricity, the 24-hour constant-temperature ventilation system in the command center had been shut down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many people smoking, and the command center was shrouded in fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph also smoked, but he didn't like the feeling of being surrounded by smoke. He was very annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people who were smoking extinguished the cigarettes in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our food and ammunition supplies are getting harder. You should smoke less if you can," Rudolph frowned, but he didn't lose his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, with his hot temper, he would have already flown into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph continued, "We need to solve the problem of food and weapon ammunition supplies. We have sufficient reserves now, but most of them are stored in two large warehouses on the outskirts of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we've lost contact with that place, and we don't know what the situation is over there. Everyone, if you have any suggestions or proposals, you can bring them up for discussion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rudolph waved his hand, making the key point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quentin said in a low voice, "Sir, according to the current satellite images, most of our last line of defense still exists, but a small part of it has no response at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the line of defense is not complete, we can't stop those monsters from entering the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we don't find a way to reinforce it, I'm afraid it won't be long before our entire line of defense collapses!"</span></p></div>
