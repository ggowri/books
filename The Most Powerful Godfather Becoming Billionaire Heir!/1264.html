        <h1>Chapter 1264 An Unexpected Visitor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're going to give me a massage, do it properly instead of..." Ava's words trailed off. Soon, she was trembling all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a proper massage. Feels nice, doesn't it?" Alexander teased with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're impossible," Ava protested half-heartedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander turned off the main light, leaving only a soft bedside lamp glowing. His movements grew bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava yielded to his touch, her senses heightened in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's desire grew as he watched Ava's gentle surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held each other close as Ava's delicate fingers traced patterns on Alexander's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the room filled with soft moans and a man's heavy breathing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, Ava was drifting between sleep and wakefulness when she felt Alexander get out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she thought she was imagining things, but when she opened her eyes, Alexander had indeed left the bed, looking surprisingly alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you sleeping? What's going on?" Ava asked, confused by his </span><span>strange move</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd love to sleep, but someone's up to no good," Alexander replied. A cold smile crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What happened?" Ava knew something was definitely wrong, and anxiety immediately gripped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's decided to cause trouble at this hour. They really don't want me to get my beauty sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander checked the time. It was 2 AM, when the world should be silent and everyone fast asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw on his clothes quickly, ready to head out. Ava jumped out of bed and grabbed his arm. "I'm worried. Let me come with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern and anxiety were written all over her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, wrapped an arm around her waist, and they left the bedroom together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire mansion, besides Alexander, both Charlize and Rosalia were forces to be reckoned with. Their mysterious intruder had already managed to alert both female security guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death was already looming over this overconfident intruder who thought they'd snuck in undetected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander took the lead while Ava clutched his hand tightly, like a little girl holding her father's hand, afraid of getting lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they? Are you sure we didn't make a mistake?" Ava's voice trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, there's no mistake. Everything is under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, taking off his jacket and draping it over Ava's shoulders. He gently rubbed her back, and immediately, a powerful surge of the Force flowed into her body. The chill vanished instantly. Even with the cold night breeze, she felt completely warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander led Ava to the entrance, telling her to wait by the front door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a few steps forward and called out into the darkness, "If you're brave enough to come here, why </span><span>not</span><span> show your face? What's with all this sneaking around? Come out on your own. Don't make me force you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's tone was casual as if he were chatting with an old friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment passed in dead silence, with only the faint chirping of insects in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava frowned. She knew Alexander's abilities. He wouldn't make this kind of mistake. Whoever was hiding out there clearly had bad intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you won't come out, don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's voice turned ice-cold, filled with deadly intent. He was clearly ready to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a voice emerged from the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well, Mr. Hawthorne. I'm impressed. You could sense me even from this distance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His apparent admiration for Alexander carried more than a hint of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps rustled in the darkness as a middle-aged man in a black uniform emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy had a long, thin face with small eyes, and thick fur-like hair growing on his neck and arms. Everything about him gave off seriously creepy vibes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh," Alexander said with a smirk. "If I'm not mistaken, you're from the Sakra Society. What brings you to my place at this hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone dripped with confidence and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get cocky, Alexander. I'm here on behalf of Mr. White to give you one last chance. Hand over the magic powder formula and join the Sakra Society.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. White is willing to forgive what you have done before. But if you refuse, you'll learn exactly what kind of terrifying force you've messed with.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As of today, our chairman isn't just the head of the Sakra Society. He's also become a high-ranking member of the Ghost. You do know what the Ghost is capable of, right? Don't sign your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face radiated arrogance. He was certain that just mentioning "the Ghost" would make Alexander shake in his boots.</span></p></div>
