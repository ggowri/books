        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung tightly to the table leg, preventing Blaze from pulling her completely in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But due to the effects of the anesthetic, Melin was becoming increasingly unable to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're done, give up the resistance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze sneered with a smug and sinister smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to get what he wanted, his crotch bulging high, unable to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor was still empty, with not a single person in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze began to grope Melin randomly, pinching and kneading her chest harshly, howling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin screamed with all her might, tears of despair streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely weak and powerless to resist the frenzied Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Blaze's dragging, Melin had let go of her resistance and was pulled into the payment area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze slammed the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the sound of the door closing did not come, as a foot had been inserted into the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who!?" Blaze's expression changed dramatically. Someone had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw who was coming, he was so scared that he took several steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander... Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze looked at Alexander with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, burning with anger, glared at him and said, "You want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a hawk hunting its prey, he grabbed Blaze by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Let me go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze's face quickly turned ashen due to the sudden lack of oxygen. He desperately tried to pry Alexander's fingers off, but was powerless to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Melin had already passed out on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaze, how dare you lay a hand on my woman? You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander wished he could kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze was stunned, stuttering out a few words, "S-She... She's y-your... Your woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was deeply regretful, realizing that Jeff wasn't Melin's man, Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the sound of chaotic footsteps approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, along with several police officers and doctors, rushed over and quickly supported Melin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver fiercely questioned Blaze, "You kidnapped Jeff, didn't you? But there's something you overlooked: your crime in the underground parking lot was witnessed, and the witness even recorded a video."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You even attacked Melin now, just wait to rot in jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... I didn't kidnap Jeff... I didn't!" Blaze still tried to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander immediately tightened his grip, Blaze's face turned black instantly, and he flailed his legs as if he was about to suffocate in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chief Oliver said angrily, "There are witnesses and videos. It's useless for you to deny it. Mr. Hawthorne, killing him is too easy. He must be severely punished by law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander let out a cold snort and did not loosen his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not until Blaze started rolling his eyes and lost control of his bladder, on the verge of death, did he throw Blaze to the ground like trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Handcuff him!" Oliver waved his hand, and several police officers rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blaze, ashen-faced, was dragged away like a dead pig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Melin regained consciousness from her coma, it was already two hours later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly awoke with a start, sitting up to find herself lying on a hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blaze, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was about to draw her gun when she was suddenly embraced from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saved you. Blaze hadn't even had the chance to do anything to you before he was arrested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar voice of Alexander sounded in her ear, and Melin instantly let down her guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saved me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin was moved to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, with a smile, picked up Melin and sat her on his lap, kissing her cheeks and eyes, and even gently biting her earlobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry. That bastard just touched you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! What are you saying? I didn't want him to touch me; I only like it when you touch me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melin snuggled into Alexander's arms, pressing her cheek against his chest and listening to his strong heartbeat, which instantly made her feel hot all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to touch you? Okay..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander kneaded Melin's full breasts with one hand, while the other slipped into the back of her pants, pressing through her silk underwear into the crevice of her buttocks, savoring the soft and smooth delightful sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah... All men are perverts. You all like beautiful women..." Melin groaned and closed her eyes.</span></p></div>
