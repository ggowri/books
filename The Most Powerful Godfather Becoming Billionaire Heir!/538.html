        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you had a great time but still want to punish me? I just want to help Ashley recover as soon as possible. A month will pass in the blink of an eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sat at the dining table, eating breakfast leisurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked at Alexander with some resentment, wondering if she should remind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was in a bad mood last night and did not go to see her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brittany came over, greeted them with a smile, and started eating her breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a little uncomfortable at first about what happened between Alexander and Nancy last night, but now she didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for men, the better they were, the more women would be around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a series of brake sounds were heard at the entrance of the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel was located in a remote area and rarely had guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six black BMWs were parked at the door. The brand-new black bodies of the cars were glowing with a dark glow, giving people a strong sense of oppression. It was obvious that there was a big shot in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The convoy stopped at the door and immediately attracted the attention of the hotel staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, someone who was more knowledgeable suddenly changed his expression when he saw the bald man getting out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald man was with a round face, curved eyebrows, and a pair of fierce eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the scar on his cheek, which extended from the corner of his eye to his neck. The scar was twisted like a centipede and was very scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have been hit ruthlessly, which almost killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a dozen big men in black all bowed their heads and saluted the bald man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man snorted with a hint of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Mr. Farrow from Underworld of </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone reminded quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were horrified and hurried away as if they were avoiding the plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> was a big boss in the gang. He was ruthless, killing people without blinking an eye. Everyone who knew him had to respectfully call him "Mr. Farrow".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Farrow, we are here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinate pointed to the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> nodded, looked at the door, took a deep breath, and strode in. The group of black-clad bodyguards behind him immediately prepared to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You are not allowed to come in. Stay outside and guard. Anyone who dares to break in will be killed without mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Alexander, he didn't dare to act rashly. As an extension of the Brilliant Group's power in </span><span>Kingsdon</span><span>, he had already received orders from Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander must be served carefully, otherwise, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mr. Hawthorne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The subordinates were stunned when they saw their boss being so serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered if he was still the same </span><span>Hoson</span><span> who was fearless and killed without </span><span>blinking an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> glanced at his men fiercely and waited until they lowered their heads obediently before he walked into the hotel alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Alexander coming in, a waiter stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, who are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small waiter dared to block the way of </span><span>Hoson</span><span>. If it were any other time, </span><span>Hoson</span><span> would have kicked him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Hoson</span><span> kept smiling and said, "I'm looking for a Mr. Hawthorne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hawthorne is having breakfast. I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't worry, wait until Mr. Hawthorne finishes eating. I can wait. This is your tip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> took out a few large bills and stuffed them into the waiter's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words and actions were not like those of a gangster, but more like those of a gentleman, but in fact, he was already mad in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so embarrassing that a gangster had to please an ordinary waiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter looked at the banknotes and was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hoson</span><span>, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a magnetic male voice was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoson</span><span> quickly put on a smile, bent his body, and trotted into the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hoson</span><span>? Could it be that he is the gangster boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter shuddered with fear and those bills fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the origin of Mr. Hawthorne inside? Even Mr. Farrow is so humble facing him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Mr. Farrow. I heard that the number of people who died at his hands was reaching 100!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was talking about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone else curiously asked, "Is Mr. Farrow that powerful?"</span></p></div>
