        <h1>Chapter 1052 A Major Case</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Rosalia had taken down more than half of the dozen or so men, leaving just four standing there, frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were all armed, none of them dared to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them turned and tried to run but before he could run far, with a swift motion, Rosalia hurled her machete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a </span><span>sw</span><span>oosh, the blood-streaked blade shot through the air like lightning, sinking deep into his back and pinning him to a large tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the remaining three men lost all resolve and turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia quickly moved behind one of them, grabbed his neck, and dragged him back. With a firm grip on his head, she twisted sharply to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of cracking bone rang out, and his neck snapped. He crumpled to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last two had managed to get a dozen feet away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia didn't chase them. Instead, she picked up the guns they had dropped and fired two quick shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the gunshots, the final two men collapsed in a pool of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one, who had tumbled into the flowerbed, struggled to crawl out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw his men lying in the blood, his vision went dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear filled his eyes as he stared at Rosalia, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia walked over, stepped on his head, and coldly asked, "Where's Cyclops?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't know... Please, don't kill me! I beg you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He avoided her gaze, clearly lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia sneered and stomped hard on his broken leg, grinding it under her heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anguished scream echoed as sweat poured from him, his pain unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm from the Sakra Society... </span><span>Aren't you afraid that they go</span><span> after you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, he tried to threaten her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one of the men lying on the ground suddenly got up and aimed his gun at Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shot rang out, but before it could reach Rosalia, Alexander suddenly appeared, pulling her aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you hurt my woman? Well, you will learn your lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the man could react, Alexander was already in front of him. With a swift motion, he twisted the man's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's wrist twisted into a grotesque shape, and he let out an inhuman howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a flick of his hand, Alexander slammed his palm against the man's forehead. The sound of cracking bones echoed as the man's skull caved in, and he collapsed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia grabbed the only remaining survivor, the one with the broken leg, and was about to finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, don't kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stopped her,</span><span> and </span><span>planted a marker inside the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled to that guy and said, </span><span>"Tell Cyclops to wait for me.</span><span> </span><span>I'll </span><span>cut off</span><span> his head </span><span>with my hands</span><span> soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're going to let me go? Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, overwhelmed with relief, couldn't believe he could survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! You've got one minute, or I'll kill you right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold tone sent the man stumbling away in panic. Wincing in pain from his broken leg, he limped off as quickly as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the sound of sirens wailed in the distance, and several police cars rushed toward the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of fully armed officers jumped out of the cars, immediately raising their guns at Alexander and Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Don't move</span><span>! Put your hands up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcom and his wife quickly ran over to explain, followed by the neighbors who had come out as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group eagerly described what had just happened, and Malcom provided the surveillance footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheriff in charge, Terry Hammond, watched the video with a stunned expression and turned to look at Rosalia and Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wow! You're so good at fighting!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers became far more respectful, realizing they were dealing with two people who had effortlessly taken down a group of armed outlaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These policemen weren't fools. They knew better than to cross someone like that. After all, if they did, their own lives could be at risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After checking Alexander and Rosalia's passports and asking a few questions, they prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke up seriously. "</span><span>Officer</span><span>, I have a major case on my hands. If you can help, I guarantee you'll earn credit for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terry's face lit up. He could tell there was something extraordinary about Alexander.</span><span> </span><span>This man</span><span> </span><span>acted like a big shot.</span></p></div>
