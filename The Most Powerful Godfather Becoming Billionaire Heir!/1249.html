        <h1>Chapter 1249 No One Had Expected</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of red-furred gorillas was remarkably shrewd. While they didn't boast the same defensive capabilities as the Mutated Monkey King, they were still a formidable threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of taking bullets head-on like their king, these agile beasts relied on their speed, darting and weaving, even leaping off to perform erratic maneuvers to evade fire while steadily closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their massive size, they moved with astonishing grace, their bodies a whirlwind of powerful limbs and rapid acceleration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sprinted forward, simultaneously dodging attacks and snatching up fallen beast corpses to use as shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dozen of them charging in unison, the firepower directed at them was diluted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The regular port workers couldn't keep up with their velocity and ended up spraying bullets indiscriminately at any nearby mutated creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a select few&mdash;Alexander, his team, and Norah&mdash;had any chance of hitting these red gorillas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the tidal wave of beasts, the gorillas stormed ahead through the flames, dying by the scores. Yet, with the bodies piling up, they managed to suppress the blaze, rapidly advancing toward their goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the flaming debris ignited by incendiary and white phosphorous rounds flickered around them, the horde pressed on, seemingly undeterred by danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the fire was completely quelled, it would be game over&mdash;the endless throng of mutated beasts would swarm right under the makeshift walls, and that would spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locked onto the immediate threat, Alexander and his team shifted their focus solely to the red gorillas, targeting the ones at the forefront.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the red gorillas staggered when Alexander's bullet hit it square in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left a gaping hole where its heart should be, blood spraying in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gorilla crashed to the ground, not dead but incapacitated, unable to rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Alexander fired on another red gorilla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bullet raced toward it, the creature suddenly dodged to the side, allowing the bullet to graze its arm, severing it halfway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deadly third shot, propelled by the Force, the armor-piercing round's velocity and power skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these beasts, excluding the likes of the Mutated Monkey King, the red gorillas were no match against his bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet struck the gorilla in the throat, ripping through its thick neck and sending its massive head flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed into the air, cascading from the creature's chest like a twisted fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just four shots, Alexander had dropped two of the red gorillas, a remarkably efficient tally compared to the effort it took to fell the Mutated Monkey King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with a dozen of the beasts still on the move, their speed was undeniable. Alexander could take down a few more, but the rest would surmount the walls before long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three stacked shipping containers barely reached 30 feet into the air, a meager barrier against these monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would easily leap over the walls, unleashing chaos and wreaking havoc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Augusta and the others were not to be underestimated. With their heavy machine guns trained on the target, they dispatched two more red gorillas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets cascaded like a curtain of fire against the advancing horde, igniting a path of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norah, armed with her sniper rifle, joined the fray, channeling her powers to bolster their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though her energized rounds didn't pack the same punch as Alexander's, </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>still wounded the gorillas effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, gorillas fell to Alexander and his team, some were left severely injured and unable to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless barrage of fire, the number of remaining red gorillas dwindled to half.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the few red-haired gorillas drew closer to the city walls, they suddenly halted, their wild eyes betraying a rare emotion: fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could scale the walls, and slaughter many, but they knew, deep down, that they too would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the mindlessness of beasts and the relentless ferocity of zombies that made them terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet these gorillas, with their burgeoning intelligence, were different. Their minds had developed enough to rival, if not match, those of humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in this moment of certain death, fear gripped them. Without a word&mdash;or perhaps a shared glance&mdash;they turned and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once relentless tide of beasts, seeing their leaders retreat, hesitated. One by one, they began to withdraw, their steps heavy but determined. The threat to </span><span>Louvian</span><span> Port dwindled rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hooray!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls erupted in cheers. Arms waved wildly, weapons clanged, and faces lit up with unbridled joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected to fend off the wave of mutated creatures on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, too, felt a swell of pride and relief. These mutated beasts were no joke&mdash;even a well-trained army caught off guard would have been decimated.</span></p></div>
