        <h1>Chapter 1053 Found Ariella</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cyclops and his accomplices </span><span>liked torturing women</span><span>, </span><span>abused and murdered people</span><span>. B</span><span>ut Alexander didn't expect them to be ogres.</span><span> They ate human meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such horrors were anti-humanity. In any country or region, they would be </span><span>put in jail or sentenced to death</span><span> for their terrible crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Alexander said, the sheriff was stunned. He didn't expect that there would be a group of horrible ogres in his jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheriff looked pale and promised, "Mr. Hawthorne, thank you for your clues. I'll catch th</span><span>ose</span><span> devils and bring them to justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel, holding Riley, went to the police station under the protection of several policemen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the critical witness, Hazel had to go to the police station to provide information, and the policemen would protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander breathed a sigh of relief. In this way, he didn't have to be distracted to protect Hazel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia refused</span><span> to stay at</span><span> Malcom</span><span>'s home and said goodbye to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left with </span><span>Alexander</span><span> </span><span>asked, "Mr. Hawthorne, what shall we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pinched Rosalia's tender cheek and smiled, "You said you wanted me to help Ariella. Let's go to the Obsidian Gang."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go!" Rosalia got excited and quickly caught up with Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what </span><span>problems</span><span> Ariella faced, Rosalia believed that Alexander could solve them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Obsidian Gang was now under Chase Burke's control. Chase used to be a mercenary. He was well-trained and ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase had bitten off a person's ear and swallowed it like a mad dog. That bloody scene scared all the people present. After that, many people called</span><span> him</span><span> "Biter"</span><span> or "Mad Dog"</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chase had strength and held power in the Obsidian Gang. After the death of the head of the gang, he </span><span>controlled</span><span> most gang members and made Ariella a mere figurehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander said, "Let's go to </span><span>find </span><span>Chase. As long as we get him, we can take Ariella back from the bar."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late at night. Alexander and Rosalia took a taxi. The light turned red, and the taxi stopped, just beside which several black cars passed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander glanced outside the window. He had All-seeing Eyes and found a kidnapped young woman in the car who was struggling desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, that's Ariella? She</span><span>'s </span><span>kidnapped!" Alexander was surprised. Rosalia had just shown him the photos of Ariella, so he recognized Ariella at a glance. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Ariella was in the car next to the taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Alexander's All-seeing Eyes, he wouldn't have seen Ariella in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that car, Ariella was handcuffed, and two robust men </span><span>grabbed</span><span> her in the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled desperately, but she couldn't break free at all. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she struggled, Ariella's </span><span>big boobs</span><span> kept shaking. Th</span><span>ose</span><span> two </span><span>rude guys </span><span>laughed</span><span> at her with </span><span>lascivious</span><span> eyes</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalia looked at Alexander in shock. She didn't understand how he found Ariella in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted the taxi driver on the shoulder and asked, "I want to buy your car. How much is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Huh</span><span>? </span><span>100,000</span><span> dollars</span><span>... </span><span>No, I won't sell it. I have to make money!" The driver said and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "Sell it to me, and I'll transfer 200</span><span>,000 </span><span>dollars to you. It's a profitable deal for you. Think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taxi driver looked at Alexander in shock and immediately nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, </span><span>the driver</span><span> </span><span>was kicked</span><span> out of the car and looked at the </span><span>bank account on his phone</span><span> with great joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light turned green, and Alexander drove the taxi and followed far behind Ariella's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since those people kidnapped Ariella, they definitely had another attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people in the cars ahead were cautious. They changed the driving direction from time to time and deliberate</span><span>ly took </span><span>detours to avoid being tracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander had All-seeing Eyes and followed these cars from a distance with&nbsp;concentration. So, those people did not discover him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people gradually sped up and drove onwards towards Aetheris Street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late at night. There were few vehicles and people on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander thought it was the time to take action. He sped the car, galloped along the road on the left, and dashed to these cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. The car is going to hit!" Alexander smiled and reminded Rosalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his deep eyes, and the best angle and speed of hitting the car came to mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped on the accelerator, and the speed of the taxi reached the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly rushed out from the side street and crashed into the car that Ariella was in.</span></p></div>
