        <h1>Chapter 461 Obsidian Core</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Streams of the Force flowed from Alexander's hands into Charlize. Saving a life was urgent&mdash;now wasn't the time to worry about conserving energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour passed without Alexander even noticing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, everyone was getting antsy. Dr. Peter Sherwood, in particular, was ready to bust the door down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door opened, revealing Alexander's tired face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he'd barely managed to stabilize Charlize's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fully heal her, he needed to use the Ultimate Legacy techniques and prepare a healing ointment known as Obsidian Balm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During Warrior training, lightsaber burns were common&mdash;even with protective energy fields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obsidian Balm worked wonders for burns, but it required a rare black gemstone called Obsidian Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Sherwood practically barreled into the room first, unable to hold back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others followed right behind, crowding around Charlize's bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize, now awake, looked startled. Her voice was weak as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wh</span><span>-what are you all doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dr. Neal and the rest were frozen, unable to believe what they were seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really brought her back... it's like a miracle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amazement spread among the crowd, and admiration for Alexander filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment ago, Dr. Sherwood had been sneering at Alexander&mdash;now, his face was bright red with shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you... thank you for saving me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's voice wavered, tears rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander spoke softly, reassuring her, "Don't worry. I'll make sure you recover completely&mdash;no scars, no side effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlize's eyes widened, hope brightening her once-dull gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander instructed the medical staff to take good care of her, then called Xavier Ulysses, asking if he had any Obsidian Core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier sighed over the line, "Alex, we've got plenty of regular black gemstones at Phoenix Gemstone Establishment, but Obsidian Core is incredibly rare. Still, don't worry&mdash;we'll search high and low."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Alexander frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is tricky. Charlize's injuries are severe. Even though I've stabilized her, we can't drag this out. Without Obsidian Core, I can't fully heal her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava hesitated like she wanted to say something but was holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander noticed and asked gently, "What is it? What's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava bit her lip before speaking, "My mom has a necklace made of Obsidian Core... </span><span>but she's in </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>, and I haven't talked to her in a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could tell there was more to it&mdash;modern tech made keeping in touch easy, so distance alone wasn't the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava took a deep breath, her expression conflicted, "For Charlize, I'll take you to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span> to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you. I'll pay whatever it takes to get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander pulled Ava into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alexander and Ava left </span><span>Loscity</span><span> early, heading to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashley stayed with Betty Rowe. Rosalia, Logan, and Marvin, along with dozens of their top men, handled security, making sure nothing&mdash;not even a fly&mdash;could get into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the airport, a group of people waited respectfully&mdash;Timothy and Arthur were at the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alexander's last punishment, which made Timothy experience pain worse than death, Timothy had turned on the Mafia and fully pledged loyalty to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, welcome back to </span><span>Tijuanea</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy kept his head down, rushing to grab their luggage like a hotel porter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A trace of Alexander's Force always lingered inside him&mdash;a way for Alexander to keep control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever that energy acted up, Timothy would seize up, feeling like his bones were shattering. It was pure agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As much as Timothy wanted to kill Alexander, he didn't dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander could crush him like a bug, and even if, by some miracle, Timothy got rid of this walking bane, who would take away the excruciating pain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, I've already booked the best hotel&mdash;the presidential suite, of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timothy flashed a grin, his gaze flicking toward Ava, who was at Alexander's side.</span></p></div>
