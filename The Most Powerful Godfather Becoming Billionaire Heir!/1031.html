        <h1>Chapter 1031 Side Effects</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla trembled as she took the black pill. She cautiously sniffed it first, and an exotic fragrance immediately filled her nose, invigorating her spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this magic powder?" Skyla was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by smelling the fragrance, her spirit was lifted up, and her body was relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was also dumbfounded, thinking, "Why would Alexander give her a magic powder? Could it be that he wants to repay evil with kindness and make peace with Skyla?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now you feel fear, and you want to use a magic powder to appease me, right?" Skyla regained her composure and laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was one hundred percent certain that the black pill was magic powder, not poison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander gave a cold smile. "This is my newly developed magic powder. You'll only know after you eat it. Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla disdainfully snorted, "I'm not afraid of the lord of the City of Sorcery, so why would I be afraid of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was convinced that it was magic powder and, in front of everyone, swallowed it in one gulp. Then she couldn't help but feel surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the magic powder entered her mouth, Skyla felt it melt into a warm liquid that flowed down her throat, spreading warmth throughout her body and making her feel very comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla's eyes lit up. She felt full of energy, and her previously depleted physical strength was all replenished, making her look vibrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her skin visibly became smooth and delicate, with wrinkles disappearing, suddenly making her look ten years younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arlene excitedly said, "Aunt, what's going on? Why did you suddenly become younger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected this scene, feeling they had witnessed a miracle with their own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander chuckled and said, "Sorry, I forgot to mention earlier. This is my newly developed magic powder. But its side effects are too strong, and it cannot be taken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla, however, laughed disdainfully, "Alexander, are you trying to save face? It's fine, as long as you hand over all your property and the magic powder formula, the Vanderbilt family might spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta was puzzled and excitedly asked, "Sir, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just Augusta but Ava, Charlize, and everyone from the Ultimate Alliance didn't know why Alexander was helping Skyla become younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Alexander truly feared the Vanderbilt family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla suppressed her smile, her eyes flashing with a fierce light, and she threatened menacingly, "Alexander, hand over the magic powder formula. Such a treasure should belong to the Vanderbilt family. Otherwise, I won't let you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She greedily stared at Alexander. After witnessing the wonders of the magic powder, she even forgot about avenging her son, only wanting to get the formula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up. Don't dawdle anymore. Hand over the magic powder formula now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla was blinded by arrogance and greed, completely disbelieving Alexander's words. She didn't believe this new magic powder had side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander showed a playful smile. "You're about to die, yet you're still thinking about the magic powder formula?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, admitting defeat isn't shameful. I feel great now, not only younger but also full of strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla glared fiercely at Alexander, thinking he was just saving face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she froze in place, her mouth wide open, unable to speak. Her smile had stiffened on her face. "No! Why...why is my body swelling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyla trembled all over, her body uncontrollably expanding slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander narrowed his eyes, raising a mischievous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was just ordinary magic powder, but Alexander had infused a large amount of the Force into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Skyla swallowed the pill, the Force entered her body, making her not only younger but also significantly enhancing her vitality and physical condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Skyla was not a warrior. Her body could not accommodate such a vast amount of the Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Force quickly spread throughout her body, beginning to wreak havoc inside her, damaging her muscles, bones, and blood vessels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was only less than one percent of the Force's power.</span></p></div>
