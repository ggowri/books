        <h1>Chapter 396 Breakdown</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence and his men glared at </span><span>Alexander,</span><span> eyes filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They absolutely despised Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary felt both startled and thrilled; Alexander had come just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she was filled with regret and shame, knowing it was a trap and yet allowing Alexander to walk into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched Alexander stride toward her, Mary wasn't sure where her sudden courage came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed a bottle and said, "I'm sorry! I'll drink this to apologize. Let's forget any unpleasantness between us, and please, don't target Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary didn't want Alexander caught up in this; her voice shook, even tinged with a trace of pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence and Eugene both grinned smugly, their eyes turning even more vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene taunted confidently, "What gives you the right to bargain with me? You can't even save yourself, and you think you'll protect Alexander? Tonight, I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a crisp slap rang through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene hit the floor from Alexander's slap, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room was stunned. The speed was unreal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene struggled to his feet, staring at Alexander with hatred as if looking at a sworn enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Mary's bottle, smashing it on Lawrence's head, letting wine and blood soak his expensive suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you love drinking so much, lick the wine off the floor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence, dazed from the blow, bled from his head and took a while to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alexander, shouting, "How dare you hit me? I'm the Godfather's representative. You're a dead man, and no one can save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all blind? What are you waiting for? Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several brawny men lunged at Alexander like beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swung their fists viciously at Alexander's face and head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eager to catch him, they dreamed of earning glory for the Mafia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary gasped, but Alexander didn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as a fist was about to hit him, Alexander moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without looking back, he grabbed a guard from behind and tossed him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, he struck the two men on either side in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three men flew back at once, crashing into tables and chairs, causing a loud noise and screams of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking down three in an instant, Alexander didn't stop, continuing to deal with the lackeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under everyone's horrified gaze, with each step Alexander took, several elites were sent to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numbers, Alexander sliced through them like a hot knife through butter, reaching Lawrence with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bodies were sprawled across the floor, blood pooling everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's cold gaze was laced with a deadly aura, making Lawrence feel as if he'd been plunged into an ice pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A devil! This guy is a true devil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence looked sick with fear; he'd known Alexander was strong, but not to this terrifying level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him, Eugene and the other Blood Gang leaders clenched their teeth, unsure what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the Mafia's representative?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! I am. What do you plan to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence replied, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander slapped him across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia's so impressive, huh? Forcing my woman to drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Mary felt her heart was filled with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she and Alexander had only one intimate encounter, it was unforgettable. And Alexander hadn't forgotten her, treating her as his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mafia... we have countless experts. You may be strong, but...but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence was so scared he could barely speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sheer presence was enough to make him break down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, he's representing Satan of the Mafia..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mary gently tugged on Alexander's arm, trying to calm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence quietly breathed a sigh of relief. "So, he is afraid of the Mafia after all," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander sneered. "The Mafia's exactly who I'm here to crush!"</span></p></div>
