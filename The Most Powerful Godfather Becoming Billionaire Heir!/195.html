        <h1>Chapter 195 The Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although many of them held flashlights, the faint light was useless against the </span><span>rainy</span><span> night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of lightning illuminated the night sky, revealing the Federer family members with sinister and twisted expressions, like demons from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, Alexander had already approached them from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gleam of his knife flashed by, and </span><span>the person</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s throat was </span><span>swiftly cut </span><span>by </span><span>Alexander</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he quickly retreated into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A body fell heavily to the ground, splashing water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then another cold flash zipped by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sizzle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp blade pierced through the chest of a man in black; his heart was already stabbed through, blood gushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander moved like a predator, </span><span>like a Death</span><span> the night, with bodies dropping to the ground one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, seven or eight members of the Federer family had fallen, each </span><span>with a single fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the vast majority of the Federer family members </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t know about this because of the</span><span> heavy</span><span> </span><span>rain</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander, like a lurking demon in the shadows, took down at least one person with every strike, continu</span><span>ing to</span><span> harvest lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Augusta and the others monitored the situation with night vision goggles, and upon seeing Alexander's rampage, they were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the torrential rain made sniping impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, watching Alexander eliminate enemies one after another made their blood boil with adrenaline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder roared, accompanied by lightning, and Edward was the first to notice something amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone be alert; there are enemies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward shouted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late; over twenty members of the Federer family had already been killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies lay in the muddy rainwater, with crimson blood flowing everywhere under the downpour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of blood mixed with the fresh air, creating a slightly acrid scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander continued his slaughter, and Edward's warning only heightened his men's panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like headless flies, looking around in confusion, unable to catch sight of Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time Alexander appeared, an enemy fell, like a tiger among sheep, taking them down one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more bodies collapsed into the rain, blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward looked horrified; with his abilities, he could barely make out a ghostly shadow moving through the dark rain, killing </span><span>everyone</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy was like a farmer harvesting wheat, cutting down the Federer family members one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is this? Who's killing our people?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward was both furious and shocked, feeling deeply helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He prided himself on being the best fighter of the Federer family, yet in this moment, he felt powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each fallen brother, nearly half of the hundred were gone </span><span>before they realized it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, they would surely be wiped out; it was a matter of life and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, gather around me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward roared in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Edward shouted desperately, the remaining members snapped to attention, surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They faced outward, backs to Edward, forming an unbreakable defense circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without urging, they all widened their eyes, waiting for the cunning killer in the darkness to appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alexander eliminated another lagging member of the Federer family, they finally spotted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar from Edward,</span><span> </span><span>dozens of people fired their guns, while others threw knives, axes, and various weapons at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't care if they might accidentally injure their own</span><span> people</span><span>; they were attacking Alexander wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Alexander had long vanished into the dark storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Federer family was in a frenzy, knowing that if they didn't kill him, they would be in serious danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed crazily toward the direction where Alexander was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames flickered from the guns, and cold weapons glimmered as they flew through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to Alexander, their </span><span>speed of attack</span><span> </span><span>was</span><span> as slow as snails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether bullets or cold weapons, they were </span><span>far</span><span> away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alexander didn't </span><span>stop</span><span> at all, moving like a ghost and continuously killing members of the Federer family on the </span><span>outside of the circle</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how wildly the bullets flew or how the knives and axes were thrown, not even the edge of Alexander's clothes was touched; instead, several members of the Federer family were accidentally injured.</span></p></div>
