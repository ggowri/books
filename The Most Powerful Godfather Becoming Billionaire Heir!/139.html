        <h1>Chapter 139 Must Save Her</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying face, with wrinkled skin like old tree bark, covered in black scars </span><span>and deep pits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two beady, triangular eyes glinted maliciously, their green pupils glaring fiercely at </span><span>Lara</span><span>, nearly scaring her unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around Drake's scrawny, tree-like neck hung a necklace made of white bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bones were of various shapes, with a pale hue mixed with yellowish-green scars, clearly indicating they weren't fake&mdash;they had to be from some beast or even a human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A round, green orb dangled from the chain, emitting an eerie glow like a graveyard's ghost light, giving off an indescribable sinister energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want money. I want Alexander's magic powder formula&mdash;and his life!" Drake laughed with a mouthful of yellowed, decayed teeth, breathing out a putrid stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> shivered uncontrollably, stammering, "W-Why are you after Alexander? Why did you capture me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're his woman. Why else would you be so close with him in the bar?" Drake replied with a smug look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> felt like crying&mdash;her luck couldn't be worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You smell nice..." Drake leaned in close, breathing in deeply around her chest with a perverse expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lara</span><span> felt a wave of nausea, nearly throwing up on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Drake reached out, aiming to grab her, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it was his disciple Jimbo calling, his eyes lit up, and he quickly picked up. "Did you catch Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only silence on the other end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake's eyes flashed with anger, and he snapped. "Jimbo, are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's icy voice then came through. "Drake, if you so much as touch a hair on her head, I'll make sure you suffer a fate worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the phone, the cold menace in Alexander's tone took Drake by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them spoke for a moment, leaving only tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!" Drake suddenly burst into laughter. "Alexander, I'll admit you're skilled, but your </span><span>woman's</span><span> in my hands. Still feel like being cocky with me? I can bang her right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned. He had just checked in with Ava, who was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he heard </span><span>Lara</span><span>'s voice calling for help over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, please help me! Please, hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Lara</span><span>?" Alexander was stunned, realizing Drake had mistaken </span><span>Lara</span><span> for his woman. It must have happened right after he left the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, bitch!" A sharp slap echoed through the line&mdash;</span><span>Lara</span><span> had been struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, considering their alliance, Alexander decided to rescue </span><span>Lara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke slowly and clearly into the phone, "Drake, your disciple Jimbo isn't dead. I have him here. Release </span><span>Lara</span><span>, and I'll release Jimbo. How about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drake scoffed. "</span><span>Jimbo's</span><span> worthless. He doesn't deserve to be my disciple. Kill him if you want. You think you can threaten me? I'll show your woman what I can do right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Alexander's response, he hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression turned serious. The deal involved ten percent of the Hansen family's shares&mdash;worth billions. </span><span>Lara</span><span> had to be saved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo began crying in terror. "Don't kill me, please don't! I can track him down. He's a heartless monster. I'll help you. I'll take you to him, just don't kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked coldly, "Are you telling the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! We wizards have our ways of contacting each other. Drake's my master, so we've exchanged 'aura signatures.' I can locate him as long as we're within range."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimbo began mumbling a chant, seeming to concentrate deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up after a moment, delighted. "Not far from here, just about five miles southeast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed Jimbo and sprinted in the direction he indicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was well past midnight, and the streets were deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite carrying a man, Alexander ran swiftly, moving with the speed of a cyclist, dashing forward with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he reached the edge of a forest, where the dense trees cast ghostly shadows in the darkness.</span></p></div>
