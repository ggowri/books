        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander looked grim. "Forget about everything else for now. First, we need to survive. The Head Priest Hezekiah is indeed powerful, but if we fail to deliver any melons this time, we'll definitely be kicked out of the church. Logan, we can't afford to let our guard down. We should practice the Energy-Gathering Technique and Arhat Fist for an extra half-hour every night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Alexander, we both had our heads touched by the Head Priest Hezekiah. So why is your Energy-Gathering Technique so much better than mine? My hoe only gives off half a foot of light, while yours is almost a whole foot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan looked frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, because I'm just that good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grinned, feeling quite pleased with himself. He instinctively touched his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't told Logan about the golden figure on his chest or the strange force surging inside him. It wasn't that he didn't trust Logan, but this power was his greatest advantage. He needed to be absolutely certain that no one knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing up at the sun, now high in the sky, Alexander called out, "Come on, Logan, let's get some food!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan played along, pretending to be obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them hurried toward the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with the rich aroma of food. Their stomachs growled. After working all morning, they were starving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were gathered around wooden carts, each carrying several large barrels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the barrels were an assortment of delicious stuffed pastries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander grabbed a bunch for Logan. "Eat up. We've got melons to plant this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mhm! Planting melons is nothing to worry about. I think I'm already getting pretty strong!" Logan nodded enthusiastically, stuffing his face with food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around them chuckled at the sight of him eating so ravenously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Logan's face fell. "Alexander, we've been here for almost a month. I miss my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander patted his shoulder and said softly, "Don't worry. If we made it here, we can make it back. I'll treat you like my own brother. I'd never leave you behind. Once we master these incredible techniques, we'll return home stronger than ever. What's the first thing you want to do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logan put down his plate, eyes shining with excitement. "First thing? I'm going to marry a beautiful wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, nearly two months had passed. Every day after lunch and in the evenings, Alexander and Logan would head to the woods by the melon fields to practice the Energy-Gathering Technique and Arhat Fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a clearing in the forest, they would open their martial arts manual and study it carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manual stated that mastering the Arhat Fist required a solid foundation. This was the key to entry. Without it, there was no progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movements had to be coordinated from top to bottom. Strength had to flow smoothly. There were 108 different techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manual detailed each technique's name and execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toward the end, it introduced the martial arts hierarchy of Sahasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast worlds were divided into five ranks: level-one warrior, level-two warrior, level-three warrior, level-four warrior, and level-five warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-One Warrior: The first step into martial arts. A small amount of the Force existed within their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These warriors had strong muscles, sturdy bones, quick reflexes, and high endurance. They could defeat more than a dozen opponents. At this level, they were eligible to take the Outer Court disciple selection at the Dominion Church or enlist as elite soldiers in the army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-Two Warrior: At this stage, the Force within them formed a vortex in their martial core, strengthening their internal organs. They could run as fast as horses and leap with the agility of apes. Their strength allowed them to defeat dozens of enemies. In the army, they could serve as squad captains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-Three Warrior: Their Force was abundant, unlocking all their meridians and deepening their breathing. They struck with explosive speed and power. The Force could protect their bodies or enhance their weapons. They were capable of defeating a hundred foes. In the military, they could attain the rank of battalion commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-Four Warrior: Their Force penetrated deep into their bones and meridians, making their bodies incredibly resilient and their strength immense. At this level, warriors had reached the pinnacle of martial arts and could establish their own schools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the battlefield, they were unstoppable. In the military, they held the rank of general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level-Five Warrior &ndash; They comprehended the true essence of martial arts, achieving a state of natural mastery. Their Force condensed into a core, making their bodies nearly invincible. They could effortlessly slay enemy generals and rise to the rank of grand marshal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, even Level-Five Warriors were not at the ultimate peak. If they could further unravel the mysteries of the body, transform the Force into divine power, surpass the five senses of ordinary humans, and awaken their divine consciousness, they could enter the Divine Transformation State. Only those who reached this level were qualified to take part in the selection for the Dominion Church's Inner Court disciples.</span></p></div>
