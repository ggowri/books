  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You have no idea how terrifying a wealthy and powerful family can be when they set their mind on destroying someone.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Ophelia walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered. He was unfazed by her threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it were the old him, perhaps he would have been scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, as long as he continued to pass the tests set by Godfather and gained more privileges, neither the Caldwell nor the Ashford family would be a threat in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They should be prepared for a strong retaliation if they dared to provoke him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, should I arrange some security to escort you back? I&rsquo;m worried someone might have their eye on you.&rdquo; Debbe approached respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had spent 60 million dollars at the auction, purchasing two longevity herbs and a painting by Clarissa herself. These were more than enough to tempt some desperate individuals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded. &ldquo;Alright, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two longevity herbs were crucial to Anastasia&rsquo;s life, and Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks. He had to be cautious even if there was only a one percent chance of trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You are welcome. It&rsquo;s my honor to serve you.&rdquo; Debbe smiled and immediately made the arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shortly after, Osborne was in a luxury car, escorted by security personnel, heading back to Isa&rsquo;s Institute of Human Research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, in another luxury car parked by the roadside, Wesley watched Osborne&rsquo;s convoy leave with a sinister look, his fists clenched and murderous intent boiling in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it. The Draco Auction House actually sent people to protect him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned. &ldquo;Since he has the VIP experience card, it&rsquo;s natural for them to provide full service, including protection. However, after today, he will no longer be a VIP at the Draco Auction House.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley nodded, still feeling dissatisfied. Initially, he had planned to have his bodyguards teach Osborne a harsh lesson once Osborne left to regain some of his lost face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re upset, but I must remind you that Osborne still has two spots to dine with Clarissa. We need him right now,&rdquo; Ophelia cautioned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hold off on confronting him until we&rsquo;ve had the chance to dine with Ms. Radcliffe. We can discuss our next steps after we meet her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Reluctantly, Wesley nodded. &ldquo;Fine. Once we&rsquo;ve seen Clarissa, I&rsquo;ll kill that piece of trash.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he waved for the driver to start the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, a seemingly ordinary taxi began following Osborne&rsquo;s convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the backseat sat a sinister-looking man. He smiled grotesquely as he watched the direction Osborne&rsquo;s convoy was heading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Follow the convoy ahead,&rdquo; he instructed. A faint purple glow emanated from his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, the taxi driver&rsquo;s eyes glazed over, turning cloudy and vacant as if he were a puppet controlled by invisible strings. He followed the instructions without hesitation, driving after the convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Such impressive powers,&rdquo; exclaimed Justin, who was also in the backseat, watching the sinister man with awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sinister man smiled faintly. &ldquo;For a fee of ten million dollars, I promised to kill this man for you. Rest assured, my skills won&rsquo;t disappoint.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin nodded at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes fixed on Osborne&rsquo;s convoy, and his face was full of murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long ago, he was thrown out by the Draco Auction House security guard. He didn&rsquo;t dare hold a grudge against the Draco Group, so he blamed all his humiliation on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thus, he decided to kill Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was desperate and contacted a top-notch assassin, the sinister man beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man went by the codename &ldquo;Milo.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was deeply shocked to witness Milo take control of the driver&rsquo;s mind and make him fully obedient to his commands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how you die this time, Osborne,&rdquo; Justin seethed. &ldquo;Milo, please make sure that trash dies in the most painful way possible.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;s just a normal person. Once he becomes my target, there&rsquo;s no escape. I&rsquo;ll send him to hell in the most excruciating way.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, you can get off ahead and wait for my good news,&rdquo; Milo continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you. After you take out that trash, I need you to deal with that bitch Ophelia too. Once I have control of the Caldwell family, I&rsquo;ll make good on my promise to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. &ldquo;Pleasure doing business with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shortly after, Justin got out of the taxi. He watched as the cab continued following Osborne&rsquo;s convoy and smiled coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you worthless piece of trash. You just got lucky with that temporary VIP card, and you had the nerve to humiliate me? This time, you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
