  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru's plan to wear down&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, thinking it over, it made sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Cuthbert had the confidence to host the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, he must have anticipated facing many challengers, each trying to exhaust him. Without a way to deal with such fatigue, he'd run out of energy after a few battles or so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that point, anyone could easily defeat him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To achieve a streak of victories at the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, you didn't need overwhelming strength but strong recovery abilities and a way to deal with opponents swiftly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's approach was sheer brute force!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His terrifying strength easily shattered&nbsp;Satoru's Dark Realm, giving him no chance to wear him down in a long fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Achieving this showed that Cuthbert's strength was far beyond Satoru's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only such immense power could crush the&nbsp;Dark Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;looked serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least he had to admit, for now, he didn't have the strength to break&nbsp;Satoru's Dark Realm&nbsp;by force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is his power so strong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His body is unique!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma&nbsp;quickly responded, "When Cuthbert was born, strange phenomena occurred. The earth split open, and a&nbsp;divine artifact&nbsp;in the form of a pearl appeared and merged with his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since then, he's had strength far beyond ordinary people. He hit&nbsp;Class AAA&nbsp;at 28, and now at 36, he's at the peak of&nbsp;AAA. He's already approaching&nbsp;Class S.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The&nbsp;Williamson family&nbsp;hosted the&nbsp;Honor Quest&nbsp;Ceremony, hoping the intense battles would put enough pressure on him to find the key to breaking into&nbsp;Class S.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, his body is fused with a&nbsp;divine artifact, which is why his strength is so terrifying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Emma finished, Osborne raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That explains it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, they weren't allowed to use&nbsp;divine artifacts, only their own power. After all, the power of some artifacts is just too overwhelming. If they were allowed, there wouldn't be any point in hosting the event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, since Cuthbert's body had fused completely with a&nbsp;divine artifact, that power now counted as his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a way, Cuthbert had an advantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't mean Cuthbert could easily breeze through the Honor Quest Ceremony, as his situation wasn't unique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people ranked on the Godson Rankings&nbsp;had also fused with&nbsp;divine artifacts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, for example, was one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fusing with a&nbsp;divine artifact, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. His body was also fused with the&nbsp;Blood Cross, though the boost it gave him wasn't as dramatic. He could only double his power after transforming into a&nbsp;Vampire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to Cuthbert, it was still far less.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that was because the&nbsp;Blood Cross&nbsp;hadn't fully awakened its powers yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne believed that once the&nbsp;Blood Cross&nbsp;fully awakened, the benefits he'd gain wouldn't be any less than what Cuthbert had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fight continued!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Satoru was defeated,&nbsp;Clay&nbsp;took the stage. He also activated his realm, hoping to wear Cuthbert down, but his fate was no different from Satoru's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert only used two moves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One shattered Clay's&nbsp;Light Realm, and the second sent him flying off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenges continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's winning streak continued. Though his challengers were all skilled fighters hoping to crack the Godson Rankings, none could put up any resistance against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two punches!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter who stepped onto the stage, they were always defeated in two punches, no exceptions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, the challengers weren't even thinking of exhausting him anymore. They just wanted to force him to use his&nbsp;Ground Punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, no one had managed to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Cuthbert had secured twenty consecutive wins, which was already quite an achievement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet Cuthbert still seemed to be at his peak, showing no signs of fatigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's so strong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could sense that&nbsp;Emma, standing beside him, was itching to take the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's immense strength had ignited her fighting spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Emma could act,&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;stood up, ready to challenge Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good luck, Rhett!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can definitely force him to use a third move!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both&nbsp;Axell&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vivian&nbsp;cheered for Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett nodded and leaped onto the stage. "Cuthbert, I'm here to challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert appeared calm, but a flash of excitement flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that moment, Osborne sensed something was off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He noticed that the way Cuthbert looked at Rhett was different from how he had viewed the other challengers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This isn't good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression changed, and he shouted, "Rhett, watch out!"</p><div class="pagination">
