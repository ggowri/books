  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Class S assassins, sent flying by Osborne's kick, were left reeling. The force of that blow, powered by his Divine Bone, was enough to shatter bones and send them spewing blood in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While such injuries weren't necessarily fatal for Class S fighters, they certainly left the assassins looking pale and shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stared at the imposing figure of Osborne, a chill ran down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally clicked for them why he had dispatched Scarlett so quickly. They had rushed to her aid the moment they received her distress signal, but it had only taken a matter of seconds for Osborne to end her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett was no slouch; she was among the top-tier geniuses, someone who could hold her own against ordinary Class S fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the face of Osborne, she hadn't lasted even a few seconds before meeting her demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they understood why Osborne topped the Godson Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such incredible power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged a glance, their eyes burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Osborne's overwhelming strength, they were resolute in their mission to avenge Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted in unison, their expressions hardening, "Alright! Osborne, you've sealed </span><span>your fate by killing Scarlett. You've earned the wrath of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and everyone connected to you will pay the price with blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you won't live to see it! We'll kill you first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Realm, unleash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, both assassins activated their Realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One enveloped himself in a Dark Realm, while the other summoned an Earth Realm. Though both were only Level Three, their Class S prowess made them formidable, perhaps even surpassing Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as he realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two assassins were leagues above the Class S clones he had faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been able to take down numerous Class S clones with his Class AAA strength because those clones lacked a Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were merely at the Class S power level without the true essence that came with a Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed vigor, the two launched their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Realm unleashed a torrent of destructive energy, while the Earth Realm provided an unyielding defense, their teamwork flawless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time, countering with his most powerful techniques&mdash;attacks taught to him by the God of Star. As his mastery grew, so did the potency of these attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blinding bursts of light and searing rays erupted, but they were met with the Earth Realm's formidable defenses, unable to inflict any real damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the attacks from both of them had no effect on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The back-and-forth battle raged on, neither side gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained his calm demeanor, while the assassins' faces betrayed their growing frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time dragged on, and the tension mounted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they had to finish this quickly. The Lambert family was close by, and the ruckus would surely draw their attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two Class S fighters among them, any reinforcements would spell doom for the assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged knowing glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to shatter his Realm! As long as he has that, our strengths in stealth and assassination are useless. If we can break it, we can take him down fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Realms began to tremble violently, and Osborne's face shifted into one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not another Realm self-detonation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, realization dawning upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how powerful or stable his Level Four Light Realm was, it couldn't withstand the backlash of two Class S warriors self-destructing their Level Three Realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all three of their Realms shattered, and they simultaneously experienced </span><span>a backlash to their mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference lay in the severity: the two who had chosen to self-destruct faced a more violent recoil, blood spurting from their mouths as their faces drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne bore only a slight trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth, his demeanor still composed despite the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class S assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization didn't linger on their injuries. The moment their Realms imploded, they activated their Stealth Arts, vanishing from </span><span>sight like</span><span> whispers in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Osborne scoffed, his body taut with tension, every muscle poised for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he felt a pulse from Satan's Eye, a warning that sent a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Realm!" Osborne shouted decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he did, the two assassins, who had been stealthily inching closer for a surprise attack, were once again caught in his energy field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crap!" they both cursed under their breath, infuriated by Osborne's unexpected agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already unleashed the Spatial Domain and the Light Realm, and now he was calling forth a third Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their positions exposed, they lost any chance of ambushing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Thunder Realm, with its Level Two peak status, proved insufficient to withstand their combined onslaught. They unleashed their full power, and in a flash, his Thunder Realm crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing they needed to regroup, the assassins slipped once more into stealth, planning their next strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet before they could strike, Osborne raised his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spirit Realm!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
