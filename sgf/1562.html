  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Bruno finished speaking, he began to shower Osborne with goodwill, treating him like a brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He assured Guy that he would arrange for Osborne to have the strongest hundred team members, promising to help Osborne achieve merit quickly enough to qualify for a promotion to chiliarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't already known their true intentions and recognized the performance they were putting on, he might have been genuinely touched, perhaps even eager to consider Bruno a brother himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, now, he suppressed a cold laugh in his heart while playing along with their charade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy and Bruno were both pleased, believing everything was unfolding according to their plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Guy interjected, cutting off Bruno's excessive enthusiasm, perhaps concerned that Bruno's overzealousness might raise suspicions in Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's had a long day. Bruno, why don't you take him back to rest? As for his team, there's no need to arrange anything just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tomorrow, let Osborne choose his own members! Any warrior under my command, whether seasoned or fresh, who catches Osborne's eye will be transferred to his hundred-man squad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, Osborne's team will be our elite strike force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Guy dismissed them with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne feigned gratitude as he bid farewell to Guy and left with Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno said, "Osborne, let me show you where you'll be staying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though you're just a centurion for now, trust me, I'll help you earn your stripes quickly so you can become a chiliarch just like me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, your accommodations will be up to chiliarch standards! No need to change places in a few days! This way is the chiliarch's quarters, three times larger than a centurion's! You can pick whichever one is available."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they walked, Bruno maintained his friendly demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne understood that Bruno was following the plan, eager to gain his trust and affection. The sooner he did that, the easier it would be to lure Osborne out into the wild and make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Osborne not cooperate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose a stone house right next to Bruno's, claiming he wanted to be closer to Bruno so they could work better together on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This pleased Bruno immensely, who felt their plan was going better than expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, Bruno didn't rush into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you should rest! I still need to check on the new recruits' training. Tomorrow morning, Mr. Guy Borden will gather everyone, and then you can select your team! He said that anyone you want, whether new or old, can be directly assigned to your squad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're getting treatment that even I don't have!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have some information on the truly talented veterans and recruits. I'll have someone bring it to you, and you can pick from that. I guarantee your hundred-man squad will be the strongest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Bruno waved goodbye to Osborne and headed off to observe the new recruits' training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched Bruno go, a cold smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once back in the stone house, he activated Satan's Eye, meticulously inspecting every corner to ensure no one had tampered with it before finally relaxing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He triggered the divine power lock of the stone house and settled into the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, one of Bruno's subordinates delivered a dossier to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This document contained detailed information about Guy's battalion, including the profiles of all the squad leaders and regular members that Osborne could choose from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a centurion, he was actually in charge of not just one hundred but one hundred and ten warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This included ten squad leaders, each of whom commanded ten regular members, making for a total of one hundred and ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned through the file.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Guy and Bruno are willing to let me pick my own team to gain my trust? If that's the case, I won't hold back! I have to assemble the strongest hundred-man squad possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wild Flame Army will soon deploy elite forces to Divine Peak Nine, and given how dangerous that place is, I need to be fully prepared. Even if my team doesn't see much action, they can serve as cannon fodder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne delved deeper into the dossier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmm? This guy's already a Celestial Deity, yet he's still just a squad leader? Shouldn't someone at that level be a centurion? Oh, it looks like he was demoted for some mistake! Interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And here's another Celestial Deity, also a squad leader?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's this? This guy has been a regular member for fifteen years, despite being at the peak of Transcendent Deity? He's participated in countless missions to hunt down the undead and has even been to Divine Peak Nine and the West Zone, yet he's never been promoted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's going on? Did he cross Guy or someone else and get put under the thumb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he sifted through the information, Osborne found many intriguing candidates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mentally noted their names, preparing to select them for his team the next day.</span></p><div class="pagination">
