  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly, &ldquo;No need. Ignore him. I will teach him a lesson later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Osborne and Alison also walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the first time that Osborne saw the raw stone casino. Diamond raw stones from various old and new mines were piled up randomly in the factory. Some of these rough materials were valued from thousands of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They mainly mined raw materials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They used machines to grind a small portion of the raw stone, which exposed the interior. This allowed them to assess the color and quality of the diamond inside visually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Betting on raw materials was a very risky move. It depended entirely on luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If people judged the quality of diamonds based on the polished portion, the risk could be reduced, but the price was higher. Just revealing a bit of diamond portion could increase its price by tenfold or even a hundredfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The most expensive materials could cost tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison whispered to Osborne, &ldquo;Osborne, let&rsquo;s take a look at the polished material over there. Their probability of cutting out top-quality diamond is much higher.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Let me see it all first.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne quietly opened the Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Satan&rsquo;s Eye could see through things. But Osborne was not sure whether it could see through the diamond stone and see what was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can&rsquo;t see through it, I&rsquo;ll have to find another way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But soon, Osborne felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those ordinary raw stones suddenly changed their appearance in his eyes as if they were objects scanned by X-rays. The internal conditions were fully displayed to Osborne, like a 3D projection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne saw pieces of diamond from the raw stones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne whispered, &ldquo;There is diamond in this rough material. But it is only the lowest grade diamond and is not worthy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing on this piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none of this either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This piece is good. There&rsquo;s actually a fist-sized piece of ice diamond inside. It&rsquo;s pretty nice. Unfortunately, it has a lot of cracks. It&rsquo;s probably only worth a few hundred thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It actually has glass quality. It&rsquo;s a pity that it&rsquo;s only the size of a thumb. If it&rsquo;s made into a small pendant, it can be sold for a few million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This piece&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne opened the Satan&rsquo;s Eye and looked at each raw stone one by one. He was looking for the top-quality diamond he needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, top-quality diamonds were scarce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Osborne stopped in front of a piece of diamond rough material the size of a human head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes lit up with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This rough diamond material that was the size of a human head looked highly ordinary. Even the most professional and experienced raw stone master would ignore it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes, the interior of the raw stone seemed dazzling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inside, there was an irregular diamond the size of a fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The quality of this diamond was such that 90% of it has reached the glass grade. The remaining 10% was even emitting a faint purple glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the violet glass type of the diamond!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price of the violet glass type of the diamond?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The violet glass type?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was stunned for a moment. She smiled bitterly and shook her head, saying, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the violet glass type for a long time. It&rsquo;s hard to tell the price. But I once saw a piece of jewelry designed with the violet glass type. It weighed about 7.05 ounces and was worth 100 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up. 7.05 ounces worth one hundred million dollars&hellip; The density of diamonds was about half that of steel. That fist-sized diamond must weigh at least 4.4 pounds. One-tenth was the violet glass type. It was precisely 7.05 ounces and worth one hundred million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was just the price of the violet glass type. The remaining 90% was ordinary glass diamond. If all of them were entrusted to Alison to design into jewelry, the price would be at least one hundred million dollars or two hundred million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Osborne already had 660 million dollars in his account, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel his heart beating faster. He couldn&rsquo;t suppress his joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This way of making money was too easy. Compared to the price of 200 million dollars, the price of this rough diamond was simply not worth mentioning. It only costs twenty thousand dollars. But it was worth 200 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He finally understood why people still tried to buy raw stones in the casino even though they knew that the opportunity was rare. But there really was a chance to get rich overnight.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alison, I like this piece of raw stone. You buy it,&rdquo; Osborne whispered to Alison happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was stunned and couldn&rsquo;t help frowning. &ldquo;Do you really want to bet on the rough material? The probability of betting on the top-quality diamond from the rough material is probably smaller than winning the lottery.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled slightly. He did not tell her the truth and said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Anyway, we are here. It&rsquo;s only 20,000 dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison did not try to persuade him. After all, Osborne was her leader. He owned Luna Jewelry, which was worth a billion dollars. The entire company belonged to Osborne. He was just playing around with 20,000 dollars. Who would dare to say anything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">According to the profits of Luna Jewelry, Osborne could make tens of thousands of dollars every hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison asked the bodyguard to take the inconspicuous rough stone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne continued to look for valuable diamond rough stones.</p><div class="pagination">
