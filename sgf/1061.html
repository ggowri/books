  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The army of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> mobilized. Except for Gerardo and the eight hundred Class S clones, the other fifty thousand soldiers were instantly divided into several teams and launched an attack on the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Counterattack," Wesson ordered loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition forces, made up of over a hundred ancient families and a dozen superpowers, totaling more than forty thousand, formed four battle formations and quickly advanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying war broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined forces of both sides approached one hundred thousand, and even the weakest soldiers were Class A masters. The various attacks launched instantaneously darkened the sky, covering the Augustine Estate in thick clouds. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder, fierce winds, and raging fire all struck at once, shaking the ground and making the Augustine Estate seem as though it had fallen into a doomsday scenario.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the two armies clashed, brutal casualties occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless flesh and bones flew through the air, wails of agony echoed across the battlefield, and whole groups fell to the ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dreadful war, Class A and Class AA soldiers were mere cannon fodder. Even Class AAA soldiers could not stand the attacks. And the Class S could also risk death with a single misstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief explosion of conflict, the battle gradually stabilized. The coalition forces gained an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, most of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army was composed of clones, slightly weaker than their human counterparts of the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the coalition forces' advantage was not significant because those three thousand Human Slaves, covered with red cloth, unleashed terrifying combat power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies were incredibly strong. Ordinary attacks could hardly penetrate their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their speed, strength, and reflexes far exceeded those of others in the same realm, and they fought fiercely, inflicting heavy casualties on the coalition forces. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, there were only three-thousands of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three thousand powerful Human Slaves could not turn the tide in this brutal war of one hundred thousand. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were overall at a disadvantage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every passing second, more clones fell. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army was quickly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesson, Greyson, and others stationed at a high point still wore grave expressions. They felt no relaxation. Instead, the pressure grew heavier because Gerardo and his eight hundred Class S clones had yet to engage in the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo calmly stood outside the Augustine Estate, watching the bloody war unfold. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He observed as his Hyenas fell one after another, his expression remarkably calm. A cold smile even adorned his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you to the abyss step by step. Decades ago, you helped Sebastian drive me out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, I will ensure you all perish in despair," Gerardo whispered, but he had no intention of making a move immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of soldiers in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> continued to decrease. Yet the coalition forces also suffered significant losses. Every two enemies taken down meant one coalition forces soldier met a tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo did not care for the losses of the Hyenas, but the upper leaders of the coalition forces could not ignore the casualties, as each member was an elite from their respective families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson, our casualties are too much!" Someone finally could not hold back and spoke to Wesson. The person was the leader of a superpower, and witnessing his family's elites dying one by one in battle made his eyes turn red with grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If the death continues to rise, even if the coalition forces win, we will undoubtedly suffer over half of our forces. Such losses are too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, Gerardo and his eight hundred Class S clones have not yet joined the fight. By the time we have lost half the numbers, what will we have to resist when those eight hundred Class S clones charge in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson took a deep breath, knowing that although they still held the upper hand, their strategy needed to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand sharply and ordered, "Unmanned combat unit assembly. Move out immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, thousands of combat drones soared into the sky from all directions of the Augustine Estate, forming a massive swarm that blocked out the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, countless battle robots appeared in other corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all equipped with energy weapons, fearlessly appearing on the battlefield, launching energy attacks after locking onto one clone after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the energy weapons of these combat drones and battle robots were not extremely powerful&mdash;ordinary Class A clones could defend against them with care&mdash;the sheer number was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over one hundred thousand combat robots and drones and hundreds attacking together, even Class AAA would be instantly killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, large numbers of </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> fell to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
