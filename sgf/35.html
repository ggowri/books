  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, Wesley was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and a group of big shots from Mayby City looked at each other in speechless astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is this even possible?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is also a VIP privilege?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone present wasn&rsquo;t a VIP of the Draco Group. They had no idea that VIPs had such privileges. The only VIP, Clarissa, had already left after buying the Ocean Whisper Sapphire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked at Debbe and saw she didn&rsquo;t refute Osborne&rsquo;s words. It confirmed that Osborne was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I should add,&rdquo; Debbe said, &ldquo;that VIPs aren&rsquo;t charged for auctioning their items here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was even more devastated at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This meant that even if Osborne spent 60 million dollars to buy back his own item, he wouldn&rsquo;t actually be spending any money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could he possibly compete with Osborne in spending? He was utterly defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was furious. He glared at Osborne with bloodshot eyes, realizing he had failed today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn&rsquo;t just lost the bet. He had lost his dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had outsmarted him at every turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before today, Wesley had looked down on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his eyes, Osborne was just a powerless, background-less nobody. A piece of trash not even worth his time. He thought he could easily make Osborne submit to him and beg for mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t even worth comparing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the end, he lost, and he failed miserably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he even had to fulfill the bet and submit to Osborne, admitting that Osborne was smarter and better than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That&rsquo;s impossible</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s eyes were wild with rage. &ldquo;Osborne, you damned piece of trash. You only won by cheating. This bet doesn&rsquo;t count at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;ll honor the bet and submit to you? You&rsquo;re dreaming. You better pray you never fall into my hands, or I&rsquo;ll make sure you suffer like hell.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Wesley turned and stormed off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t stop him. Instead, he turned to the influential figures of Mayby City. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, didn&rsquo;t you just say that as witnesses to the bet, you have the authority to make the loser honor it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, Mr. Ashford is trying to back out. Shouldn&rsquo;t you all condemn his lack of integrity? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be forcing him to fulfill the bet? Or are your words just hot air?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s disdainful words made the faces of the big shots from Mayby City turn grim. It was as if a slap had landed squarely on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had dared to force Osborne to honor the bet because he was just an ordinary civilian with no power to retaliate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now that Wesley had lost, they&rsquo;d have to be insane to help Osborne compel Wesley to fulfill the bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had planned to quietly slip away, but Osborne&rsquo;s blunt exposure left them feeling humiliated, and their expressions soured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Young man, you&rsquo;re way too cocky. Watch your step, or you might eat dirt,&rdquo; one said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Humph, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; another said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the end, none of the big shots paid any heed to Osborne and quickly left with their entourages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Osborne scoffed. &ldquo;What sort of big shots are you? Just a bunch of spineless cowards who prey on the weak and cower before the strong.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then spat on the ground with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hadn&rsquo;t genuinely intended to force Wesley to honor his bet because he knew Wesley would never do it. His goal of humiliating Wesley had already been achieved, so whether Wesley did it or not didn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had no interest in having a minion like Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. Today, you&rsquo;ve completely offended Wesley and the Ashford family. They won&rsquo;t let you off,&rdquo; Ophelia said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s fine for him to get at me, but I&rsquo;m not allowed to fight back? Do you think he can just walk all over me because he&rsquo;s supposedly superior? Now that he&rsquo;s humiliated, he&rsquo;s throwing a tantrum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, I&rsquo;m starting to think your judgment is seriously flawed. You divorced me because of trash like Wesley?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I told you that you&rsquo;d regret it one day. And now, you already do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned, wanting to retort but finding herself at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because deep down, she realized Osborne was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had always believed Osborne wasn&rsquo;t in the same league as her and that he couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought divorcing Osborne and marrying Wesley was the right decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, she was starting to doubt herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Wesley didn&rsquo;t seem so impressive, and Osborne didn&rsquo;t seem so worthless. How else could she explain Wesley being repeatedly outmaneuvered by Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In terms of intelligence and tactics, Wesley had lost every round.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the thought of Wesley&rsquo;s powerful family made Ophelia resolute again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Ashford family was an elite, top-tier family that could offer her support that Osborne could never match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would never regret divorcing Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia scoffed, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve given you fair warning. If you value your life, you should never mention our past and leave Mayby City for good. Otherwise, you won&rsquo;t live to regret it.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
