  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Zoe stepped forward, her excitement palpable. "Let me handle this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can take them on! Their sonic attacks are similar to my power. They're Class S, so it's the perfect chance to see who's stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement, sensing her determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, along with Anastasia and the members of the Blood Demon Vanguard, held back, allowing her to take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Cillian and the others, seeing the danger the Carey family was in, rushed to join Dave in attacking the Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts were formidable, their bodies covered in thick scales or sharp, sturdy feathers that made them nearly impervious to damage. Even Class AAA warriors were struggling to make a dent in their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, each beast had a fist-sized white spot&mdash;its only weakness&mdash;where the armor was absent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their speed was astonishing, and they clearly possessed a level of intelligence, instinctively protecting that vulnerable spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the fighters from Eidolon City knew where to strike, hitting that weak point proved nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They either missed or found their attacks blocked by the beasts' wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sonic attacks from the Dark Exotic Beasts affected hundreds of warriors, many lost their ability to fly, evade, or defend themselves. The beasts seized the moment, charging forward with the intent to wipe them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining fighters from Eidolon City frantically attacked, trying to halt the onslaught, but their efforts were in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Zoe made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice rang out in melodious notes, almost like a song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each sound was perfectly aimed at the Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, and instantly, they began to stir restlessly, their agitation evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, they abandoned their attack, fixating their furious and wild gazes on Zoe. With a collective roar, they flapped their massive wings and charged toward her with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's expression shifted slightly, a hint of seriousness crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she felt no fear; Osborne stood right in front of her, and she trusted he wouldn't let the Class S beasts harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she continued to "sing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful melodies flowed from her lips, and the Dark Exotic Beasts became even more agitated, completely ignoring the warriors from Eidolon City as they barreled toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected turn of events stunned the fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, it was a stroke of luck. They quickly seized the opportunity to rescue the hundreds affected by the beasts' sonic waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the ones most terrified were Dave and Cillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood just a few hundred yards in front of Zoe, and the Class S beasts were charging straight toward her, but it looked like they were coming for them instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five of them froze in shock, paralyzed by fear as they watched the beasts approach, their murderous intent clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll hold them off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave, ever the quick thinker, shouted furiously for Cillian and the others to flee, ready to sacrifice himself to buy them time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the Class S beasts were about to reach them, poised to tear them apart, something astonishing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts suddenly froze in mid-air, their bodies stiffening as if they had hit an invisible wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their wings ceased flapping, their bodies stiffened, and then, as if in slow motion, they began to fall. With a heavy crash, they landed in Herbmaster Canyon, utterly still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousands of Eidolon City warriors were equally dumbfounded, completely </span><span>clueless about what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, which had been wreaking havoc just seconds ago, causing massive casualties and chaos, had suddenly dropped out of the sky as if their batteries had run dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't understand what in the world had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single soul noticed that it was all Zoe's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her power, clearly superior to that of these Dark Exotic Beasts, had overwhelmed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the force of her attack, the beasts' brains had simply stopped. That was why they'd plummeted to the ground like lifeless hunks of meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!" Zoe's face was slightly pale, but she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Controlling Class S Dark Exotic Beasts is tough, I'll give them that! But I did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ruffled her hair, his smile warm. "My Zoe's getting stronger by the day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally snapping out of his shock, Dave shouted, "Quick! Finish them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, everyone snapped back to reality and rushed to obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beasts were completely immobilized, making it easy for the warriors to target their weak spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, all the Class S Dark Exotic Beasts were slain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
