  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, a grin spreading across his face, "Left eye, Satan's Eye; right eye, Medusa's Gaze. Not a bad combo at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, if you knew that your Human Slave serum not only failed to turn me into a puppet but actually awakened Medusa's Gaze, giving me the power to petrify, I bet you'd regret not just killing me on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And honestly, the benefits I'm reaping go far beyond just Medusa's Gaze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the changes rippling through his body, Osborne reflected on what it meant to break through the Class S barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every challenger who made this leap experienced a violent transformation, one that could potentially double or even decuple their physical capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it felt like something different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement bubbled over. "I think my physical strength has shot up around fivefold! The only reason it isn't more is because my baseline was already sky-high, at the very limits of Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hey, fivefold is more than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, my training system is unlike anyone else's. My soul of powers has already merged with my body! The stronger I am physically, the more formidable my overall strength becomes! So, this fivefold boost means every aspect of my power has surged by the same amount!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implications of this are mind-boggling! I could take on the best of Class S and actually stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe even take them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an endless reservoir of energy coursing through him, eager to test the limits of his newfound might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But time was of the essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've spent four whole days here trying to break through to Class S! By now, those Aberrants must be on the verge of completely taking over Rosmandi, preparing to assault the Augustine family! I've got to hurry! Let's see what's happening..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne activated his Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had turned it off during his breakthrough to avoid disturbances, but now, as he switched it back on, a flood of information poured in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as he scanned the messages, shock taking over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, "What! Gerardo has launched an attack already!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy's leading eight hundred Class S clones, plus a hundred Class S fighters each from the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization, all storming the Augustine Estate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family suffered a crushing defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the aid of a mysterious force, it seems everyone managed to flee from the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no one could get close to Anastasia, so she is still stuck in Mount Celestial Reach, unable to escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as the gravity of the situation hit him like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through him as he read the final message from Wesson, sent nearly an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson had managed to lead the Augustine family to safety, but that was an hour ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knew what might happen during this period?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most chilling realization hit him: Anastasia was still trapped at Mount Celestial Reach with no way out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to go back! I've got to head back right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgetting the changes in his Class S body, Osborne tore through the dimensional rift and plunged in, leveraging interdimensional travel to rush back toward the Augustine Estate in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he emerged from the rift, only to immediately activate another round of interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dizzying sequence, he used interdimensional travel six times in quick succession, covering nearly two thousand miles before catching sight of Newport City's coastline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakthrough to Class S had worked wonders; each leap now spanned 300 miles instead of the old limit of 120 miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spatial Domain had automatically advanced to Level Three with the breakthrough to Class S, not to mention his Thunder Realm and Spirit Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every aspect of his abilities had been pushed to a higher level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel that the changes he experienced after breaking through to Class S were just the tip of the iceberg. But right now, he didn't have the luxury of time to explore those newfound abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grim expression, he charged toward the Augustine Estate, urgency fueling his every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Augustine Estate, Gerardo and Armstrong landed swiftly on the rocky terrain of Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong asked, a grin creeping onto his face, "Did you feel that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone from the Augustine family has managed to escape, yet there's still a lingering energy signature here! It's peculiar. It could be hiding something interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not to mention that the Godfather's scepter packs a serious punch! The sheer power emanating from it seems to originate right from this spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm betting there's definitely a secret buried here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We lost ten Class S powerhouses in the fight against the Augustine family, you know. If you managed to breach this place, it's partly because of our sacrifices. So, when it comes to the secrets inside, the League of Divine Descent deserves a slice of the pie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No objections, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression darkened. He wanted to claim the secrets for himself, but he knew that was a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent wouldn't let such an opportunity slip through their fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, he wasn't ready to go head-to-head with them just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold, steely gaze, he replied, "If we find something worthwhile, I'll make sure you get your share."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he stepped forward, pushing into the depths of the mountain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
