  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gripped the Godfather's scepter tightly, its sleek surface feeling oddly unremarkable at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, it seemed like any ordinary staff, unassuming and devoid of power, gleaming with a dark golden hue that didn't suggest any hidden strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But everything changed when he channeled a trickle of energy into the scepter. In an instant, Osborne was overwhelmed by the sensation of merging with Mount Celestial Reach itself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mountain transformed before his eyes, no longer just a majestic peak but a living entity pulsating with unfathomable power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That very essence began to respond to the scepter's call, swirling toward him in a torrent of energy. As he focused, the Godfather's scepter radiated with dazzling light, growing stronger with each passing moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a marvel to behold, but it came with a price; pain shot through his palm, a warning that he was on the edge of exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne withdrew his energy, halting the influx just before he could no longer bear it. Even so, what he felt coursing through the scepter left him in sheer awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured, "What a formidable force!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I unleash all of this, even if I can't wipe out a top-tier Class S like Rumen in one blow, I could definitely deliver a crushing blow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As my strength grows, the power I can command through the Godfather's scepter will only become more terrifying. In time, taking down a top-tier Class S like Rumen will be a walk in the park! Even a god wouldn't stand a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wouldn't be surprised if I could take down a god!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The realization sent chills down Osborne's spine as he began to understand the depths of the connection between the Godfather's scepter and Mount Celestial Reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This mountain isn't just a geographical marvel; it harbors enormous secrets!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly tucked the scepter away, a smile breaking across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having felt its power firsthand, the weight of the responsibility on his shoulders felt considerably lighter. Within the realm of the Augustine Estate, he could face any challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he couldn't kill them, he could at least inflict some serious injury!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ever since Sebastian publicly appointed him as the new patriarch, the responsibility had felt like a crushing burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family and the Draco Group were in the most precarious of situations right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this very moment, he found himself stepping into the role of head of the Augustine family and leader of the Draco Group. He had no choice but to uphold the family legacy and fortify the Draco Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Osborne understood the scale of the pressure weighing on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Aberrants, the League of Divine Descent, and the Eityreia Organization were all top-tier superpowers, each one stronger than both the Augustine family and the Draco Group combined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, they were his adversaries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no denying it; the Aberrants was his arch enemy. Gerardo was not the sort to let bygones be bygones. The threat loomed&mdash;Gerardo would come crashing into Newport City before long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about Gerardo's formidable abilities made Osborne's expression harden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Gerardo actually fused with a god's corpse using forbidden methods! If he fully harnesses that power, even with the Godfather's scepter in hand, I won't stand a chance against him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Gerardo isn't taken down, I'll be the one on the chopping block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if the Aberrants don't fall, it'll be the Augustine family and the Draco Group facing extinction!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His resolve solidified as the reality of his situation sunk in. The battlelines were drawn; he knew he had to be ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "There's also the League of Divine Descent! With Grandpa's elimination of Rumen, we've officially made a bitter enemy of them. The League is composed of thirty-six Divine Families, far stronger than the Aberrants!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Rumen? He was the deputy leader of the League and head of the Thornberry family! What's worse, his grandfather is Helios, the strongest figure on Blue Planet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed his temples, the weight of this revelation making his head throb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Helios was a legendary powerhouse; he didn't know just how terrifying Helios was, but he was certain that he was far from being able to handle such a formidable adversary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne mused, "If the League of Divine Descent decides to wage war on the Augustine family under the pretext of avenging Rumen, what can I do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And let's not forget the Eityreia Organization!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Eityreia Organization is shrouded in mystery. No one really knows how powerful they are, but they are definitely on par with the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make an enemy of them would lead to a world of trouble; their assassins can strike at any moment, making even sleep a perilous endeavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All in all, trouble is coming our way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt the burden on his shoulders, heavy as a mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether it was the Aberrants, the League of Divine Descent, or the Eityreia Organization, none were foes he could contend with at this level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One misstep and the Augustine family could fall apart; the Draco Group could crumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough of this overthinking! We've already made enemies, so let's prepare for battle! If they want to kill me or wipe out the Augustine family and the Draco Group, then I'll take at least a few of them down with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that fiery resolve, Osborne tightened his grip on the Godfather's scepter and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he stepped into the living room, he found the high-ranking officials of both the Augustine family and the Draco Group waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they caught sight of him holding the Godfather's scepter, they promptly bowed in respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godfather, we greet you!"</p><div class="pagination">
