  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, deep in thought. "Right now, I'm at the mid-level of Deity King, and breaking through will take time. The energy required for my next leap is enormous! Even with the Infinite Devouring Eyes and a hundredfold time acceleration, moving up a rank isn't a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, advancing in rank won't significantly boost my peak combat power. I can already reach the pinnacle of Deity King by leveraging my strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless I can quickly break through to Supernal Deity King, any minor advancements won't make much of a difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's simply out of reach!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, frustration mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to leverage my way to the pinnacle of Deity King is about as far as I can go. As long as my Divine Flame hasn't fused with my Divine Body, I'll never become a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, how can I strengthen myself further? What can I do to ensure I'm ready to face a Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Divine Body has already hit the Celestara limit, and there's no way to enhance it further! It can only grow stronger as I advance in rank. The same goes for Satan's Eye; it's maxed out too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about Spatial Clone? It's already at Level Seven, and reaching Level Eight won't be easy&mdash;it requires a lot of time and understanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, even if I do get Spatial Clone to Level Eight, adding another sixty-four clones won't matter if my own combat power doesn't improve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undead Cataclysm is in the same boat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To stand a chance against a Supernal Deity King, I need to focus on... leveling up my elemental essences!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can push any of my space, dark, or lightning elemental essences from Level Eight pinnacle to Level Nine, I might just have a fighting chance against a Supernal Deity King! At least against an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, I'd feel a lot more confident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that requires Miracle Elixirs&mdash;lots of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce determination flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can get my hands on a substantial amount of Miracle Elixirs, I could elevate my space, dark, and lightning elemental essences to Level Nine in no time! Then I'd have the means to challenge a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with enough super Miracle Elixirs, Anastasia and the others could also boost their powers quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And let's not forget the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They need Miracle Elixirs to compensate for their lack of talent and break through to Deity King! Once they reach that level, I can use blood energy to help them advance rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they all hit the pinnacle of Deity King... Then even a Dukedom Level Power like the Baxter family wouldn't stand a chance against us! Just the Blood Demon members alone could crush them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I urgently need Miracle Elixirs&mdash;lots of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they're only found above the divine peaks! For most people, getting Miracle Elixirs from the divine peaks is a Herculean task; they might be lucky to find one or two. But I'm different. I have Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as I steer clear of the core depths of the divine peaks, I'll be safe! With Satan's Eye, I can quickly gather a mountain of Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are forty-two divine peaks in total across Celestara! If I scour all of them, even just the outer areas, how many Miracle Elixirs could I find? At least several thousand, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened, excitement coursing through him. "I'm all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resolute heart, Osborne set his sights on collecting Miracle Elixirs, and his first target was Apocalypse Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Divine Peak was just a stone's throw away from Apocalypse City to the east, and with interdimensional travel, Osborne could reach it in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't rush to set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His ambitions stretched far beyond just one peak; he intended to scour all forty-two divine peaks scattered across Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to do that, he needed a map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Osborne had to know where each divine peak was located. Celestara was vast, and without a clear guide, he would waste precious time just searching for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused to himself, "I need a detailed map of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more detailed, the better! Only with the most comprehensive map, combined with my spatial power, can I efficiently gather what I need from all forty-two divine peaks. But such maps aren't typically available at ordinary places."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he turned to Darren. "Where can I get my hands on a map like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly replied, "My Lord, a detailed map of all of Celestara is considered a strategic asset!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't find it just anywhere. Your best bet is at a shop run by the Sanctum of Light. They might have it, but there's no guarantee. You could give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The shop is called Luminous Bazaar. They have locations in all ten major cities of the West Zone, and the one in Apocalypse City is just to the west."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! I'll head over there right now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
