  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to tear you apart, bone by bone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I'll kill you!" Crimson screamed, her rage boiling over after the brutal kick from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by fury, she charged at him, her eyes burning a fierce red, completely consumed by her wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's expression hardened in response to his wife's pain. His anger grew. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he brandished his dagger, ready to join his wife in delivering ruthless punishment to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Greyson and Roy were prepared to join the fight again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they were no match for Sin even if they teamed up, but still they charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had saved them countless times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had put everything on the line to protect the Lambert family&mdash;even killing Scarlett and taking down numerous assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization for their sake. How could they turn a blind eye while he faced the wrath of Sin and Crimson alone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made a move without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they weren't alone. Every member of the Lambert family leaped into action, rallying together. Most were Class A or Class AA fighters, nowhere near Sin's level, but they refused to back down. After all, there was strength in numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a force nearing a thousand, the Lambert family unleashed a barrage of attacks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume and the two Class S warriors&rsquo; attack were enough to make Sin fearful for direct confrontation and dodge aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's voice boomed, cold and sinister. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lambert family, are you looking for death? I planned to deal with Osborne first, but if you want to throw your lives away, I'll gladly oblige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, I'll leave Osborne to you! I'm going to wipe out this sorry lot first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frantic energy in his tone echoed in air but there&rsquo;s no appearance of him, sending chills down the spines of Greyson, Roy, and every Lambert family member, flipping the confidence they had built only moments before into pure dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the scariest part of facing an assassin from </span><span>Eityreia</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their stealth and assassination method!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sin ranking as the organization's second-best assassin, his stealth was razor-sharp, letting Greyson and Roy completely lose track of him. Sin's next strike could come from any direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they positioned themselves back-to-back, vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone stays alert!" they warned the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in their hearts, doubt took root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they stay alert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collective strength of the Lambert family paled in comparison to Sin in his stealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy only hoped that Sin's target was </span><span>not</span><span> other members of the Lambert family but rather themselves. At least, as Class S beings, they still stood a chance of surviving an attack from Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their hopes were swiftly dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their worst fears crystallized when Sin, though seething with rage, remained calculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that sneaking up on Greyson and Roy would have a slim chance of success, he shifted his focus to the Lambert family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the very targets to eliminate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With swift precision, Sin maneuvered through the throng of Lambert family members, the air charged with malice as he unleashed a torrent of power, putting dozens of them under his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying force descended, and the unsuspecting members hardly stood a chance. They were killed in an instant, with their bodies violently torn apart in the wake of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this swift, merciless strike, at least fifty members of the Lambert family were dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy shouted. Their eyes were filled with rage as they watched the disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by sheer desperation, they lunged forward, determined to stop Sin from continuing his brutal assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a cold, mocking laugh, Sin vanished once again into thin air, slipping back into his stealth mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men felt a surge of panic as they lost sight of him, their eyes filled with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swung wildly, desperate to strike back, but hit nothing but air. All they could do was shield the remaining Lambert family member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a flash, Sin reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He materialized above the cluster of Lambert family members, a wicked grin plastered across his face. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, he brought his foot down with terrifying force, crushing dozens beneath his heel, turning them into a gruesome mush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once more, Sin disappeared again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter echoed eerily around them, filling the air with a chilling dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of pathetic trash. You think you can take me on? Enjoy your fear, because I will become the very devil that haunts you. I'll show up again and again, reaping your lives until none of you are left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mad cackle reverberated. The Lambert family found themselves lost in a sea of terror because they couldn&rsquo;t see where he was, their faces paling under the weight of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like that the death was watching from the dark, ready to pounce the moment they showed a weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, despair washed over the remaining members of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two brutal strikes, Sin had managed to eliminate over a hundred. If this continued, they would all be wiped out, obliterated from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
