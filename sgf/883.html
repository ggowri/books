  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, Osborne effortlessly completed his forty-nine consecutive victories, his energy still radiating peak power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challengers he had faced were no match for him, barely taxing his strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Plus, Osborne was absorbing star power from the void, rejuvenating himself with every bout.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he gazed at his fiftieth challenger, a cold smile appeared on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A killer from the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had not forgotten the ambush orchestrated by Mose and five other Eityreia assassins back in Tethynia. If it hadn't been for his own cunning, he would have met his end there.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no fondness whatsoever for the assassins of the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hound, the challenger, fixed his cold gaze on Osborne and said, "Should I call you Osborne or Axell? In Tethynia, you disrupted my organization's plans and killed Mose and five other top six assassins. It's time you paid the price."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasps filled the arena as the crowd processed this revelation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was Axell?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of them had no idea that the one who defeated Cuthbert in Tethynia was actually Osborne in disguise. Now, hearing Hound's words, they were in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Osborne is Axell!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder he's so powerful. Axell already showed his strength at Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony when he took Cuthbert down! After that, he ranked 205 on the Godson list."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He even killed Mose?! That's insane!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's crossed the Eityreia Organization. He's done for!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted in chatter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, however, remained unfazed as he locked eyes with Hound. "They came to kill me, so I killed them. Seems fair, doesn't it? And as for you? You think you can make me pay? Mose was ranked 205, and I took him down. You're sitting at 420. What makes you think you can handle me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, this is a ring, not some wild battlefield."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged off Hound's threats, fully aware that news of Mose's demise couldn't be hidden. His feud with the Eityreia Organization was already set in stone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hound let out a chilling laugh. "I'm just warning you. In the arena, I can't touch you! Not even in the wild. But back in Eityreia, there are plenty of people who can take you out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've crossed us, and trust me, you're finished! Soon, someone will come for you, and she'll defeat you right here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Hound turned his gaze toward the audience, his eyes landing on Scarlett in the front row, filled with longing and admiration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled. "Oh really? I look forward to it! But you're droning on. Let's wrap this up. I'd hate to waste time during my Honor Quest Ceremony."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne sprang into action.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hound's face paled as he realized he was no match for Osborne. He immediately attempted to activate his stealth to evade the attack. Osborne's prior opponents had all fallen in a single move; if he could manage to do that with Hound, he'd make history.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For over two hundred years, no one had achieved fifty consecutive wins with all single strikes in the matches.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hound didn't even entertain thoughts of defeating Osborne. His sole purpose on the platform was to force Osborne to use two moves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, that was out of reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His stealth proved utterly ineffective before Osborne, who struck with blinding speed, sending Hound crashing to the ground, blood spraying from his mouth as multiple ribs shattered. With a cry of agony, he tumbled off the stage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hound was defeated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had finally achieved his fifty wins in a row.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family erupted into cheers once more, their excitement palpable. Nobody could believe that Osborne had breezed through fifty consecutive victories, leaving them all in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifty challengers had fallen before him, each defeated with a single strike.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had made history. It was a feat no one had ever accomplished before!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unbelievable!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm finally convinced! I used to question why Godfather held an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne. I thought he didn't deserve it; I believed Godfather had made a mistake. But now I see! Godfather's insight is beyond our understanding. He recognized Osborne's strength long before we did, while we doubted both Osborne and Godfather!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely incredible!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family was riding high on a wave of exhilaration, and Osborne stood on the arena floor, practically glowing in their eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, they felt a profound sense of pride because of Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Vincent and Owen, who had their own grudges against Osborne, were spellbound as they gazed at him shining on the stage. They couldn't help but admire him, realizing how utterly he had outclassed them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne had only been slightly stronger, perhaps jealousy would have simmered beneath the surface.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was so far beyond them that it erased any trace of envy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, as they looked at their fellow family member basking in victory, they felt that same rush of glory.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was just too strong!</p><div class="pagination">
