Aside from the seven of them, all that remained were scattered bits of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had ended after just one round of Divine Ascendance Techniques!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single one of the hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan had been able to withstand the onslaught. They had all been annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even had the chance to surrender or retreat from the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the deadliest match since the border competition began three days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, battles between Supernal Deity Kings had resulted in few casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, every Supernal Deity King had strong survival instincts and immense vitality. Even if they were outmatched, they could still surrender and retreat to save their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan had died in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, collecting the blood energy left behind by the fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this blood energy, several Blood Demon members might be able to break through to Supernal Deity King! But there's no rush. The Blood Demon members still have matches to fight. We'll help them improve after the competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, feeling quite pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware of Anastasia, Zoe, and the others' strength, which was why he had confidently stood back and let them handle the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they hadn't disappointed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only issue was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been too ruthless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could have ended the battle with far less effort, but perhaps worried about leaving any survivors, they had gone all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they had wasted a lot of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, tone it down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne advised. "It's like cracking an egg. A little force is enough. No need to go all out and waste energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others blushed at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the arena was now calm, the surroundings were anything but.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance erupted into frenzied cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was ecstatic, their faces flushed with excitement. Witnessing Anastasia and the others effortlessly slaughtering the Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses of the same rank left them both shocked and immensely proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the true power of the Human Community's super geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says the Human Community is inferior to the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our top-tier super geniuses can crush Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses like ants, squashing them like bugs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are unstoppable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roars of excitement spread throughout the Human Alliance, filling everyone with renewed confidence and fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two consecutive massacres had left them all exhilarated to the point of tingling scalps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, the Dark Deity Legion was eerily quiet. Two straight massacres had crushed their morale, and doubt began to creep into their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the Human Community too strong, or was the Paramount Supreme Clan too weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why were these supposedly inferior Humans slaughtering Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses in back-to-back matches?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they really destroy the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remained silent. Despite outnumbering the Human Alliance five to one, their momentum had been completely suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a stark contrast to the situation just two days ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne looked up at the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, a smile showed on his face. "Icy One, is this the best the Paramount Supreme Clan can offer? A bunch of trash sent to their deaths? Weren't you going to kill me in the arena? Yet I didn't even lift a finger, and your so-called geniuses are already wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's voice echoed, though his projection didn't appear this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the loss was too humiliating for him to show his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only his voice reverberated through the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings truly live up to their reputation. Their talent is indeed unparalleled. But your cultivation is too low! You're only at Ascension One. That won't change anything! The Paramount Supreme Clan has plenty who can easily crush you! In the face of the Dark Deity Legion's overwhelming numbers, you'll be trampled like ants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Then let's continue the competition! Send out those Ascension Two trash! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings aren't satisfied yet. We've decided to stay in the arena and challenge your Paramount Supreme Clan's Ascension Two trash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you want to kill us, come at us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the surroundings fell into stunned silence. Everyone stared at Osborne and his group in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had they just heard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the others had just won the Ascension One match, and now they wanted to stay in the arena to challenge the Paramount Supreme Clan's Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to represent the Human Community in the Ascension Two Supernal Deity King match?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they insane?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Human Community was in an uproar, except for the God of Light, who already knew the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Osborne lost his mind? Eight of them are going to face a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan? This is sheer recklessness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings challenging a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings? Not even the craziest lunatic would dare to do something like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Osborne overconfident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, please stop them! We can't let such super geniuses die in the arena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was frantic with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the God of Light remained calm. She said, "Enough! If Osborne has made this decision, let him be. Don't worry. I believe he wouldn't do something he's not confident about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light wasn't going to stop them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she insane too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one dared to voice such thoughts. They could only watch Osborne and the others in the arena with growing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Icy One couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're too arrogant! Eight Ascension Ones challenging a hundred Ascension Twos? If you win, I, Icy One, might as well smash my head into a wall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so eager to die, I'll oblige you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To the arena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Icy One's command, a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, already prepared, quickly stepped into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne and the others, their faces filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Anastasia and the others' previous performance had been shocked, even they weren't confident they could match Anastasia and her teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they had a hundred people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Ascension Two couldn't they handle eight Ascension Ones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings, at Ascension One, would dare to challenge a hundred Ascension Twos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle was already won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings were as good as dead!</span></p><div class="pagination">
