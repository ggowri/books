  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two years and three months of intense seclusion, Osborne's remarkable insight allowed him to absorb nearly all of Adolph's thousand years of cultivation experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he had transformed into a warrior specialized in soul power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His immense soul power was nothing short of impressive&mdash;one could say it rivaled that of any Ascension One Supernal Deity King who focused solely on soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "So, I can consider myself an Ascension One Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least in terms of soul power techniques, I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I have some gaps in other areas, they're not too significant! Besides, my soul power strength far exceeds that of the average soul metahuman! Even someone like Adolph, an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, can't match me in raw soul power strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The golden soul power is indeed intriguing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gains from this experience were monumental; Adolph's soul memory had completely filled the gaps in Osborne's soul power offense, turning what was once a weakness into a strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, his explosive soul power attacks could threaten any Ascension One Supernal Deity King, surpassing even dark, spatial, and thunder powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can share this soul power knowledge with Zoe! Her talent for soul power is far superior to mine! Even though she doesn't have golden soul power or a Soul Current Ocean, she's definitely stronger than Adolph! With Adolph's insights, Zoe's strength will surely increase, making a significant difference in her journey to becoming a specialized Supernal Deity King in soul power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne immediately called for Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, did you need something?" Zoe asked, her eyes wide and curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Zoe, how's your training going lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe said, "It's going okay! I've reached the peak of the advanced Deity King Level, and I'm not far from the highest Deity King Level! My Divine Body is close to Level Nine, but my progress has slowed down a bit. I need a lot of yellow Miracle Elixirs to keep pushing forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, my soul elemental essence has reached Level Nine, and I'm trying to comprehend my own soul power Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, I haven't found a clear direction yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly summarized her situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but admire her progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost at the highest Deity King Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Body at Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her soul elemental essence at Level Nine, while working on her own soul power Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is advancing rapidly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her progress also reflected that of Anastasia, Kendra, and the others; everyone was moving forward at a similar pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, however, seemed to be a bit ahead&mdash;she was close to mastering her own lightning-based Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding in satisfaction, Osborne replied, "Don't rush your training too much! Make sure to rest well! And don't worry about the yellow Miracle Elixirs; I'll find a way to get them for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what did you call me for, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "I have a gift for you! It should really help enhance your strength! It might even accelerate your understanding of your own soul power Divine Ascendance Technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes lit up with excitement. "What kind of gift, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A soul memory from an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Zoe's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Zoe had been diligently striving to grasp her own Divine Ascendance Technique, but she found it to be an uphill battle. Her rapid rise in strength had left her lacking in experience, making it hard for her to even imagine what a soul power Divine Ascendance Technique would look like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she could get her hands on a soul memory from an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power, her gaps in experience would be instantly filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just about boosting her strength; it was about solidifying her foundation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong foundation was essential for building towering achievements!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe wasn't alone in this struggle; Mila, Bryce, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, and others were all facing similar challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who seemed to have a slight advantage was Anastasia, who had witnessed Osborne wielding his lightning-based Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was practically bouncing with excitement. "Osborne, how on earth did you manage to get a soul memory from an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King? And one focused on soul power, no less!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, casually recounting the details of his encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a warrior specializing in soul power, she understood better than anyone the dangers of engaging with soul power, especially against an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Osborne's survival was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since was knew Osborne's knack for creating miracles, her initial shock quickly settled into admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm ready!" she declared, determination shining in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in response. "Great! If you feel any discomfort, just let me know, and I'll stop right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he had sealed all of Adolph's soul memory deep within Zoe's mind. Throughout the process, Zoe remained remarkably calm, showing no signs of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she received the memories, Zoe dove into them, eager to understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Maybe I should prepare a memory like this for everyone."</span></p><div class="pagination">
