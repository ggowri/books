  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared in disbelief at Osborne, who had shattered her Temporal Amber and freed himself from its binding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock on her face was palpable. "Ascension Two Supernal Deity King... breaking my Temporal Amber?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt as though she must be hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Temporal Amber was one of the most powerful deadly forbidden techniques of the Nature Elf Clan, notoriously difficult to master. Even among the Nature Elf Royal Family, few could wield it successfully, and its binding capabilities were almost unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Alfreda had learned to use Temporal Amber, it had helped her defeat numerous formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one at her cultivation level had ever escaped its grasp, and even those at one level higher found it nearly impossible to break free without a significant investment of time and effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never encountered anyone with a lower cultivation level who could escape her Temporal Amber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here stood Osborne, a Supernal Deity King at Ascension Two, who had just done the unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda inhaled sharply, her expression shifting to one of grave seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could no longer afford to underestimate Osborne; he was now a rival on her level, perhaps even beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, her tone turning serious, "Osborne, I truly underestimated you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one with a lower cultivation level has ever shattered my Temporal Amber! No one with a lower cultivation level has ever made me go all out! But you&mdash;you're about to be the first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to unleash my full strength and do everything in my power to defeat you. So, be on your guard! I have my pride, and I absolutely cannot accept losing to someone who's four levels below me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, her face became stern and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the shift in her demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Alright then! I'm looking forward to seeing just how strong you really are when you go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Alfreda made her move. She soared into the air, rising to a height of less than three hundred feet. The formidable lightning in the sky turned wildly chaotic, as if it were about to strike her down if she ascended any higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but worry for her safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she stabilized herself at about several dozen yards, appearing like a deity against the backdrop of the stormy sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a pair of radiant, multicolored wings burst forth behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of overwhelming pressure descended upon Osborne, causing him to stiffen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda declared, her gaze fixed on him, "Luminous Elven Wings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know why I scored Class SS on the Astral Testing Arch? It's because I've mastered the Luminous Elven Wings! Normally, these wings can only be formed by warriors of the Elf Race after they break through to Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the entire history of Elf City, fewer than 100 individuals have ever achieved Luminous Elven Wings before reaching Empyrean Sacredness! And those still alive? You could count them on one hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I managed to condense my Luminous Elven Wings right after breaking through to Ascension Four! This is my greatest secret. Besides my father and brother, you're the only one who knows it! I've never shown anyone else the power of the Luminous Elven Wings, but you will be the first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, feel the strength of the Luminous Elven Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, the dazzling wings behind her fluttered slightly, unleashing a torrent of razor-sharp energy blades that shot toward Osborne with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blades were racing toward him, closing the distance in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, determination glinting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luminous Elven Wings, huh? Let's see what you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a shimmering aura of Sacred Power enveloped him, creating a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed as countless energy blades assaulted his barrier. Shock coursed through Osborne as he felt the intensity of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?" His eyes widened in disbelief as he realized his Sacred Power defense was quickly crumbling under the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is... Sacred Power! Alfreda's attacks are infused with Sacred Power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a freight train. "Alfreda has mastered Sacred Power too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was utterly astonished. He had only managed to integrate the two essence through the incredible power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, finally attaining Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turns out, Alfreda has it too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the revelation settled in, a deeper understanding dawned on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No, wait... this isn't her own power; it's the strength of the Luminous Elven Wings! Those wings can only be wielded by the Elf Race once they reach Empyrean Sacredness, so naturally, they come with their own Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since Alfreda's cultivation level is still quite low&mdash;far from Empyrean Sacredness&mdash;her Luminous Elven Wings, while powerful, must lack the full strength of true Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes! Her Luminous Elven Wings hold a comparable level of Sacred Power to mine! And since she's higher in cultivation level, her attacks are indeed stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with this newfound clarity, Osborne's expression turned somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who wielded Sacred Power understood its true terror. If it weren't for the Luminous Elven Wings, he was confident he could defeat Alfreda without invoking his absolute forbidden zone, even at her Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, things had changed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luminous Elven Wings continued to flutter, unleashing endless blades of Sacred Power that crashed against Osborne's defenses, shattering them with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he stood his ground, refusing to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse War Armor!" he shouted, invoking his newly mastered dark-element Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse War Armor, powered by his Sacred Power, manifested around him, reinforcing his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gray armor looked incredibly sharp and stylish, quickly stabilizing his protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's Sacred Power blades began to bounce off his newly fortified defense, no longer able to penetrate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!" Alfreda's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can block my Luminous Elven Wings' attacks?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're a complete freak! I'm starting to think even a Celestial Progeny at your cultivation level wouldn't stand a chance against you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the geniuses from the Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, or Angel Clan wouldn't be able to take you on at the same cultivation level! You're downright incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was serious, there was no hint of defeat in her demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath. "Earlier, I was worried that my full strength might hurt you, which is why I held back. But now? I know I won't beat you unless I give it my all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it comes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Luminous Elven Wings behind her erupted with blinding radiance, generating even larger, more powerful blades of Sacred Power that shot toward Osborne at an alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't block this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had underestimated the sheer power of Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings. With them now unleashed in full force, he realized that even with his Sacred Power and the Eclipse War Armor, he might not be able to withstand the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference in their cultivation levels was simply too vast.</span></p><div class="pagination">
