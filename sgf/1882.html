  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Universe-Sealing Formation truly had the power to seal off the sky and earth within a radius of hundreds of miles. As long as Trevor didn't deactivate the formation, everything within it would be compressed by its force and drawn toward the center as it shrank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the mountains and rivers inside the crimson light of the formation were rapidly rising and shifting, resembling an earthquake in progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jungle where Osborne had been hiding had completely transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was apocalyptic, causing everyone trapped within the formation to shift uneasily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more people were pleading and weeping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sensed the chill of death closing in. The Universe-Sealing Formation was overwhelmingly strong; escape was impossible. They could only watch as the formation contracted, knowing they would soon be crushed into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this chaotic moment, some began to curse Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Theodore. Be a man and show up immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are getting yourself killed by provoking Mr. Baxter, but why drag us down with you? If you're hiding nearby, why don't you come out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show yourself, you bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you die, Mr. Baxter will stop the formation, and we'll all be saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole, come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid no mind to the curses. Aside from Alicia and Nadia, he didn't know any of these people, so their fates didn't concern him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he glanced at Alicia and Nadia, also trapped in the formation, he bit his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were his aunts and his mother's sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they also were ensnared within the Universe-Sealing Formation, unable to reach out for help. They could only watch in despair as the formation shrank, their available space dwindling with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair began to etch itself onto their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, the Universe-Sealing Formation had a radius of 300 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it soon shrank to 250, then 200, and finally 100 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, everyone inside had to channel their divine power just to withstand the encroaching rocks and soil; otherwise, they would be overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't keep going!" Osborne's face was grim. If this continued, he would be crushed by the formation, and Alicia and Nadia would perish because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I confront him?" Osborne thought, hidden among the rocks, his cold gaze fixed on Trevor, his heart ablaze with willingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But could he really take down the Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Trevor's prior displays of power, Osborne doubted he stood a chance, even if he threw everything he had into the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to try. Otherwise, they would all die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolving himself, Osborne took a deep breath and leaped out from his hiding place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he dispelled the Eclipsing Mantra, his aura became immediately apparent within the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Trevor's attention snapped to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally decided to show yourself? You're brave to think you can take me on&mdash;might as well be asking for death!" Trevor exclaimed, eyes glinting with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled deeply, forcing himself to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first time confronting a being as powerful as the Supernal Deity King, and it was an understatement to say he wasn't nervous. The weight of Trevor's icy stare bore down on him, filling him with pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supernal Deity King was truly at the apex of power in the Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had fused their Divine Flame and Divine Body, transcending to another level, standing on the precipice of divinity, ready to ascend to an even higher realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supernal Deity King was far beyond those who were at the highest Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was acutely aware of his lack of confidence in facing Trevor, yet he had no choice now but to confront him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trevor, how did you know my true body was still nearby? I thought I hadn't shown any weaknesses. Why are you so sure I'm not thousands of miles away?" he asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made himself trapped by his own overconfidence and negligence. He could have left his main body far away, directing a Spatial Clone to handle things, but he had opted to observe closely, believing in his escape abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he couldn't comprehend how Trevor had deduced that his real body was so close by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't figure this out, even if he survived this encounter, he risked encountering greater dangers in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor chuckled, "Want to know? I won't tell you! Besides, what's the point? You're on your way to death. Are you preparing for your next life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt, who stood beside Trevor, suddenly locked eyes with Osborne, his gaze burning with rage. "Dad, kill him! Kill this bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor nodded, immediately springing into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying chill of his power enveloped Osborne, rendering him stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare go against me? Now, you'll pay for your foolishness! Go to hell!" Trevor bellowed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
