  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the colossal Ethereal Elven Temple, Isidore stood clad in a resplendent white robe adorned with golden accents, the embodiment of divine elegance. Yet, his face was contorted with fury, his voice erupting in a roar of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rage swirled through the temple, the Sacred Power within pulsating dangerously in response to his tumultuous emotions. All around him, the clergy of the temple fell to their knees in terror, fear plastered across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why?! Why did the rules of Umbra Earth find out about my soul?! If only I had a bit more time, I could've seized the Ascending Sacred Sanctum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I've got nothing to show for it&mdash;just the crippling loss of one of my origin souls, and the Sublime Concealment Orb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore gritted his teeth, his blood boiling with unrestrained killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have exuded the grace like a divine being, but at that moment, he resembled a furious demon, seething with uncontained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he simply couldn't help seething with rage. To get his hands on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Isidore had pulled out all the stops. He'd been so damn confident, thinking he had it in the bag. But in the end, all his efforts went down the drain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Isidore fail to acquire the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, but he also ended up losing the Sublime Concealment Orb and a fragment of his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a colossal blunder and an absolute rip-off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After venting his fury like a raging bull, Isidore still couldn't cool his jets. He paced back and forth in the massive temple, his face growing icier by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole temple was now shrouded in a thick cloud of negative energy. It was so intense that everyone in there was holding their breaths, tiptoeing around as if walking on eggshells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore muttered, "Ascending Sacred Sanctum..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ethereal Elven Temple, this divine artifact-level palace, was a jewel among the structures of Elf City, representing nobility and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously satisfied with his place here, Isidore now gazed upon its grandeur with disdain, resentful of its inadequacy when compared to the overwhelming promise of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in its damaged state, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum surpassed the temple by leagues&mdash;it was a treasure that held power beyond his wildest dreams, and now it had slipped through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's mine! It was meant to be mine! You damn human, I gave you the means to retrieve the Ascending Sacred Sanctum from that Umbra Earth continent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't let me down! If you manage to bring it back, I will find you and reclaim what is rightfully mine! Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing heavily, Isidore forced himself to rein in his fury, taking a moment to recalibrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without delay, a figure appeared before him, bowing respectfully. "Mr. Isidore Rosedale!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out everything about that human who entered Umbra Earth with Alfreda. Where did he come from? Who does he know? I want to know everything! And keep your eyes on Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Umbra Earth continent is about to return to the Umbra World! As soon as that human shows his face, inform me immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" the figure replied, disappearing swiftly to fulfill the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore scowled, muttering, "That human must have the Ascending Sacred Sanctum now. Knowing I would hunt him down, he probably won't dare to return to Elf City! He'll use a Spatial Translocator to get back to his home planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'll uncover where he's from! If he lived in Elf City, he would have left traces behind, and I will find them! You can't escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how far you run, even if I have to scour the entire cosmos, I will hunt you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger simmered, and then a thought hit him&mdash;Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that woman! If it weren't for her sacrificing herself to block my attack, I would have taken out that human ages ago! He wouldn't have escaped the cave and made it to the surface... I wouldn't have had to chase him down, and I wouldn't have been exposed to the rules of Umbra Earth and subsequently hunted down and expelled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything is that damned woman's fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The princess of the Nature Elf Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I can't find that human bastard for now, I'll start with the Nature Elf Clan Royal Family! You've ruined my plans, so you'll pay the price! Even if you die, I won't spare your parents. I'll make you regret ever crossing me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone, summon the King of the Nature Elf Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell him I need to discuss something important regarding his daughter, Alfreda..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, as cold as ice, carried a hint of mockery and a chilling intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore mused, "That human, Alfreda gave her life for you! If you knew something had happened to her parents, would you just sit back and do nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister laugh escaped his lips, echoing through the vast temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison to the boundless expanse of deep space, Celestara seemed small, almost insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one were to gaze down from the </span><span>cosmos</span><span>, they would see that Celestara was merely a mid-sized planet, lost among the countless stars of the universe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this vast cosmos, there were countless life-sustaining planets like Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for most of its inhabitants, Celestara was their entire world. Many spent their lives training, never having the opportunity to leave the confines of their home planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lives were often restricted to a small area of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the majority of the Human Community made their homes in the West Zone of Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most had never ventured beyond its borders, and fear kept them from doing so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond the West Zone lay territories controlled by the Paramount Supreme Clan, home to ruthless warriors and the Dark Deity Legion. Those who dared to cross into those lands would be captured and enslaved or, worse yet, brutally killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The West Zone was the last bastion of safety for the humans, their final refuge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the Human Community was on the brink of losing even that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan had mobilized over fifty billion troops from the Dark Deity Legion, led by the formidable Icy One and other Dark Sovereigns, to launch a final extermination campaign against the Human Community in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark clouds of war loomed ominously over the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the revered God of Light, once a symbol of hope for the Human Community, seemed unable to shield them from the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After twenty-five days of the border competition, the supreme commander of the Dark Deity Legion, Icy One, had finally run out of patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His initial goal was to undermine the confidence and morale of the Human Alliance while easily capturing Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Icy One soon realized that they were unable to gain the upper hand in the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their ambush on the Sanctum of Light</span><span> over twenty days ago</span><span>, which resulted in the death of Osborne, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, the situation in the border competition had not shifted in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For over twenty days, the battle between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community had remained evenly matched, with neither side able to secure a definitive victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peaks City remained firmly in the hands of the Human Community, much to Icy One's frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had granted him only three months to conquer the West Zone, and with a month already gone, Icy One was running out of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he made the decision to abandon the border competition and launch a full-scale war, unleashing the overwhelming power of the Dark Deity Legion to crush the defiant Human Community in the West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the drums of war began to sound, and a terrifying conflict was on the horizon.</span></p><div class="pagination">
