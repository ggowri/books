  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The battle on the arena was incredibly intense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Every prodigy emerging from the zone duel is incredibly powerful. In fact, each of them possesses the strength to defeat an ordinary warrior at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the very least, they have fused three types of powers in advance, possess two or three Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, and can fully unleash the power of the Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, the rules of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel are very cruel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each group has eleven people, but only two will advance, while the rest will be eliminated. Among these two, one is bound to be a prince or princess of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, only one out of the ten prodigies emerging from the zone duel can advance. A chaotic battle will directly eliminate nine prodigies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For this, everyone gave it their all; no one wanted to give up the chance to enter the top twenty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With a boom, various powerful attacks erupted. One contestant after another was defeated, injured, and then either fell off the stage or directly surrendered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The pace of the competition was extremely fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, in a situation where Offensive Sacred Artifacts can be used but Defensive Sacred Artifacts cannot, most cultivators' defenses are inadequate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as they get hit, they are easily defeated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only those with extraordinary talent from powerful races, like the Magma Devourer among Silicon-based Lifeforms or the Astralwreck Dragon like Flash, can have defenses stronger than their attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the people on the stage don't have such strong defenses. So, attacking and dodging are the keys to victory."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In just a few minutes, eight people from the first group had already been knocked out of the ring, losing directly. At this moment, still fighting were Mason, ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and a warrior ranked in the top twenty of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, Mason displayed greater strength and blasted his opponent out of the ring. He immediately threw his head back and roared excitedly, overwhelmed with emotion, because after defeating this opponent, only he and Seraphina were left on the stage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This means he has advanced."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Next, he will face Seraphina to determine who will be the group champion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Mason looked at Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina had been standing at the center of the ring all along. No matter how intense the battles around her were, she remained indifferent, and no one dared to attack her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This was a bit boring for Seraphina."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, seeing that the others had finally decided the outcome and only Mason was left on the ring besides her, she couldn't help but smile and say, 'Are you going to admit defeat?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After hearing her words, Mason said with a serious expression, 'Of course, I won't admit defeat. Princess Seraphina, I know I probably can't match you, but it's rare for me to have the chance to face you. I don't want to waste this opportunity.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina, let me see just how big the gap is between me and you, the number one in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Mason unleashed an even stronger Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that he hadn't been giving his all earlier, many spectators couldn't help but show surprised expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said, "Mason is impressive. He hadn't been going all out earlier, yet he still dared to challenge Princess Seraphina. He's truly courageous, worthy of being ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. If the princes and princesses weren't participating, he would most likely be the champion of this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman agreed, "That's right. His strength is remarkable. Ordinary warriors at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level are definitely no match for him. He can even challenge some warriors at the mid Empyrean Sacredness level. But how many moves can he withstand in front of Princess Seraphina?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man scoffed, "A few moves? I think Princess Seraphina can defeat him in just one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman said, "That's impossible, right? I think it would take at least three moves. After all, they're at the same cultivation level. Even though Princess Seraphina is strong, she can't be ridiculously overpowered. Based on Mason's displayed strength, I believe even ordinary warriors at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level would struggle to defeat him in one move. Even if Princess Seraphina is very powerful, she surely isn't stronger than warriors at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man smiled and said, "We'll see about that. You have no idea how powerful Princess Seraphina is. I think that among all the participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, no one can withstand Princess Seraphina's three moves, except for the other princesses and princes. If you don't believe me, just watch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was also watching the battle on the stage, his expression very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were also watching the battle intently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all curious about how strong Seraphina, ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and Mason, ranked tenth, truly were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching the battle between these two would give them a clearer understanding of their own skill levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, their strength had greatly increased after using the Legendary Dragon Elixir. However, they hadn't had the chance to spar with anyone, so they had no idea what level their strength was at now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina calmly said, "Come on! Let me show you the gap between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She then gestured to Mason. "You attack first. Otherwise, you won't get the chance to attack."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Mason's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's words were too arrogant, but he couldn't refute them because Seraphina ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing Seraphina holding nothing, Mason awkwardly said, "Princess Seraphina, aren't you going to take out your Sacred Artifact? Do you intend to fight me barehanded?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled faintly and said, "If I feel your strength is enough to require me to use my Sacred Artifact, of course, I will take it out. But for now, you're not worthy of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, her words caused an uproar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "Princess Seraphina is too confident. Facing Mason, who ranks tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, she doesn't even use her Sacred Artifact and lets Mason attack first. They can't use any Defensive Sacred Artifact, so one mistake could lead to elimination."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man scoffed and said, "Is she confident or just arrogant?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason gritted his teeth and said, "Princess Seraphina, since you're so careless and don't take me seriously, don't blame me. Let me see how you plan to handle me barehanded."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Mason launched his attack directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Artifact in his hand was a Legendary Sacred Artifact. After years of practice, he could already unleash part of its power on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this portion of power far surpassed the strength of a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is why he ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Broke it!" Mason shouted as his attack furiously charged toward Seraphina, instantly enveloping her and sealing off all her escape routes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Defensive Sacred Artifacts were not allowed in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, it gave him a chance to defeat the strong while being weaker. After all, even if his strength was inferior to Seraphina's, he could still break through her defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't believe Seraphina could block his attack bare-handed without getting hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's expression was calm. Just as the attack was about to hit her, she gently threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Mason's strongest attack, unleashed with the Legendary Sacred Artifact, was instantly shattered by Seraphina. Seraphina's fist power, even without losing speed, continued to surge toward Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason could feel that he was locked on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to escape, also to dodge, but he simply couldn't. In an instant, he was struck by the terrifying fist power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Mason spat out blood frantically and then fell off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro announced, "The first group's top rank is Princess Seraphina, and the second is Mason. Now, contestants from the second group, please come to the stage for the battle."</span></p><div class="pagination">
