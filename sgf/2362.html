  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Satan's Eye?" Osborne was utterly confused. He thought that in such a situation, apart from using Satan's Eye to spy on the situation inside the Ethereal Elven Temple, there was nothing else he could do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why did Primordial say I can use Satan's Eye to save people?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried to recall and suddenly thought of something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Primordial, are you saying I can use the ocular energy of Satan's Eye to transfer the three of them from the Ethereal Elven Temple to the internal space of Satan's Eye?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "You finally remembered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breaking through to the Sacredness Level, his Satan's Eye could indeed use ocular energy to collect items and store them in its internal space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back on Umbra Earth, Osborne discovered a Sacred Crystal vein deep within the Corrosive Marsh. However, due to the terrifying corrosive gas, he couldn't mine it. In the end, he used the ocular energy of Satan's Eye to transfer all those Sacred Crystals into the internal space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anything Satan's Eye could see and be enveloped by its ocular energy could be transferred by Osborne into the internal space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the problem is, Osborne always thought this ability only worked on inanimate objects, while Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood are living beings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Can Satan's Eye really transfer these living people into its internal space?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure because he had never done it before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Under normal circumstances, this is certainly impossible. Since they are living beings with considerable strength, they would definitely resist. Therefore, Satan's Eye's ocular energy cannot transfer them, let alone move them into its internal space."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you can communicate with them first, asking them not to resist. In that case, you should be able to transfer them from the Ethereal Elven Temple's prison into Satan's Eye's internal space."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne's eyes widened with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Primordial made sense. Besides, this was the only way. He could give it a try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, he had already copied Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood's life essences. Even if something went wrong, he could resurrect the three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll do it this way!" Osborne decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was far from the Ethereal Elven Temple. Satan's Eye could see them, but it wasn't easy for Osborne to communicate with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne</span><span>&#32531;</span><span>&#24930;&#38752;&#36817;&#12290;&#24456;&#24555;&#65292;&#20182;&#23601;&#34987;</span><span>Elf Race</span><span>&#30340;&#19968;</span><span>&#38431;&#25252;&#21355;&#25318;</span><span>&#20303;</span><span>&#12290;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>&#21069;&#38754;&#26159;</span><span>Elven Mother Tree</span><span>&#21306;&#22495;&#12290;&#38500;&#20102;</span><span>Elf Race Royal Family</span><span>&#30340;&#25104;</span><span>&#21592;</span><span>&#65292;&#20219;&#20309;&#20154;&#19981;&#33021;&#38752;&#36817;&#12290;&#21542;</span><span>&#21017;</span><span>&#65292;&#25105;</span><span>&#20204;</span><span>&#23558;</span><span>&#26432;</span><span>&#20102;</span><span>&#20320;</span><span>&#12290;</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the fierce Elf Race guards, Osborne had to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "At this distance, I should be able to communicate with them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne released a faint wisp of soul power, concealed it with the Sublime Concealment Orb, and sent it toward the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything progressed smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faint soul power was already barely noticeable. Under the concealment of the Sublime Concealment Orb, even the dozen warriors at Empyrean Sacredness in the Ethereal Elven Temple, including Isidore at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, did not detect anything unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne's soul power reached the vicinity of the prison holding Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne encountered a problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the prison, there was a powerful force to prevent Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood from escaping. Now, it became an obstacle. Osborne's wisp of soul power was too weak to break through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If unable to break through this barrier, Osborne would be unable to communicate with Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne thought, frowning deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To avoid detection, the wisp of soul power he sent out was extremely weak. If he didn't come up with a solution quickly, it would soon dissipate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's eyes suddenly widened because he noticed Isidore, who was training in the core area of the Ethereal Elven Temple, suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stopped training and walked toward the prison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly activated the power of the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide that wisp of soul power better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Isidore appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand, and the defensive power outside the prison cell instantly dissipated. He pushed the door open and walked in, completely unaware of Osborne's wisp of soul power hidden nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking this opportunity, Osborne controlled the soul power to enter the prison and temporarily hid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What does Isidore want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Isidore waved his hand, and a streak of Sacred Power flashed quickly, transforming into three palms that slapped Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood's faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three were jolted awake by the slap, their cheeks swollen, blood trickling from the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne was instantly furious, thinking, "Isidore, you're courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood humiliated by Isidore, Osborne was extremely furious. But he could only endure it, knowing there was nothing he could do at the moment, and intense anger might instead expose him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only temporarily suppress his anger and killing intent toward Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isidore, what exactly are you trying to do?" Uriah was furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Hilaria and Sherwood's miserable state, he glared fiercely at Isidore, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Isidore didn't care about his anger and calmly said, "Uriah, don't look at me like that. Otherwise, if I get upset, I'll kill your wife and son right in front of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!" Uriah gritted his teeth and quickly restrained the anger in his eyes, knowing that Isidore would truly kill Hilaria and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda had already died at Isidore's hands, and Uriah didn't want Hilaria and Sherwood to be killed by Isidore as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isidore, what exactly do you want? I've already told you. I barely know Alfreda's friend Osborne, let alone his background. Even if you ask me a hundred times, my answer will still be the same. I really don't know," Uriah said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore smiled and said, "Don't worry. I already believe you. I'll find Osborne myself. I'm not here today to ask about him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne frowned deeply, thinking, "Isidore is indeed targeting Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood because of me. Isidore wants to get information about me from them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, I took his Ascending Sacred Sanctum on Umbra Earth. Given the value of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Isidore will definitely go crazy trying to find me. I&rsquo;ve dragged them into this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and vowed in his heart to rescue the three of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not here to ask about Osborne? Then what exactly do you want to do?" Uriah asked, a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore smiled and said, "Uriah, do you know why I haven't killed you yet? It's because of the Elven Mother Tree. As the King of Nature Elf, your connection with the Elven Mother Tree is the closest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elf City cannot be without the Nature Elf. Without the care of the Nature Elf, the Elven Mother Tree would have problems. That's why I didn't kill you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Uriah became serious and gritted his teeth, saying, "What are you trying to say? You'd better not think about harming the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, no one in Elf City will forgive you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
