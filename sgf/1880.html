  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Spatial Clone sprang into action without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man, still at the early Deity King Level, stood no chance against Osborne's Spatial Clone, who had taken down both Zachary and Virgil simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a sneak attack, the young man couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the young man was lifted into the air by spatial energy, and before he could react, he was struck with a devastating blow that killed him instantly, causing his body to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Osborne's Spatial Clone seized the young man's Dimensional Bag and made a hasty retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that the others realized what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor, witnessing the theft of the Dimensional Bag containing 10 pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor, felt furious, but he refrained from intervening&mdash;Kurt's safety came first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Spatial Clone on Astral Wolf Peak was mercilessly slamming Kurt into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With most of his divine power sealed, Kurt was in grave danger; a blow of such magnitude could either cripple him or lead to his demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, you're digging your own grave!" Trevor shouted in frustration. He couldn't afford to hold back any longer and took decisive action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a terrifying force enveloped Astral Wolf Peak, causing the temperature to plummet dramatically. Everything, including Osborne's Spatial Clone and Kurt, was encased in ice almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne's Spatial Clone broke free from the ice mere moments later, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's speed was astonishing. In what felt like seconds, he had traversed the crystalline ice castle, arrived at Astral Wolf Peak, and stood before Osborne's Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold expression, he reached for Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his gaze on Osborne and declared, "You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Trevor unleashed a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne, guided by the awareness of his Spatial Clone, truly felt the overwhelming might of the Super Deity King. His clone had previously been able to take on Zachary and Virgil together, yet now, standing before Trevor, he felt an immense pressure that rendered him almost immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's palm, now encased in ice, crashed down on the Spatial Clone, obliterating it in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor was taken aback by how effortlessly it had all unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the clone shattered, a frown formed on his face. "A Spatial Clone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he remained composed, sneering as he continued, "Theodore, do you really believe you can snatch 10 pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor from me like this? You're deluding yourself! Do you think I haven't figured out your true identity? Do you think I haven't prepared for this? Theodore! This is where you meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor waved his hand and commanded, "Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of young men and women immediately stripped off their clothes, revealing their bare skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On their backs were peculiar tattoos that began to glow as they unleashed their divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tattoos transformed, exuding a strange, crimson light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Universe-Sealing Formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glowing tattoos detached from their bodies and floated into the sky, merging to form a massive sphere that radiated a strange crimson light, resembling an inverted shield and enveloping an area of hundreds of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused and fearful, onlookers stared at the bizarre crimson light, sensing an inexplicable dread creeping into their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Osborne, concealed in the jungle, felt a chill run down his spine as he realized he could no longer use Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial energy he relied upon to escape was now useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression soured as he looked up at the glowing shield above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "What is this? A formation? Is this Trevor's doing? He's truly figured out my identity. He's made preparations specifically to counter my spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been careless! I shouldn't have come in my real body. I should have retreated at the first sign of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My overconfidence has cost me dearly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's forehead creased in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Trevor let out a cold snort. "Theodore, my Universe-Sealing Formation is complete. You're finished! I can sense your real body nearby, trapped within my formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, have you thought about how you plan to die? When I find you, you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Trevor's piercing gaze roamed the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who met his eyes trembled, gripped by an overwhelming sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared coldly, "Theodore, there's no escaping my Universe-Sealing Formation! Why not just show yourself? I can grant you a quick death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
