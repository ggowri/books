  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was joking, but Isa bit her lip, her eyes glistening with </span><span>emotion</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had a say in it, she'd rather not be a Celestial Progeny at all. She'd choose a simple life beside Osborne over all the power and glory in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, Isa knew it wasn't a choice she could make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a tough and perilous journey ahead of him, fraught with danger and madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current strength, sticking by his side would only slow him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streaming down her face, she took a step closer to Osborne and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I promise I'll get stronger! Just wait for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be back by your side before you know it, ready to fight alongside you! No matter how dangerous or crazy your plans are, I'll stand by you and shoulder the burden with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a jolt run through him at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded seriously. "Alright! I'll wait for you! You're a Celestial Progeny, and with the Fairy Moon Sect's leader as your mentor, I know you'll become one of the top-notch warriors in no time! And when that day comes, even if others try to take you away from me, I won't let them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded emphatically, her eyes ablaze with determination. "I belong to you and only you! No one can tear me away from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being surrounded by onlookers, Isa didn't give them a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne went rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a terrifying power approaching from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and caught sight of a figure materializing, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the leader of the Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between the Fairy Moon Sect and the Mystic Sirius Sect was immense. Even using a Translocator, it would take some time to get there. Yet here she was, having rushed over after receiving messages from Angela and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she hadn't relied on a Translocator; she'd come under her own steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his past life, Osborne had caught a fleeting glimpse of the Fairy Moon Sect's leader when </span><span>she</span><span> </span><span>visited the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered being deeply impressed by her extraordinary aura. Now, as he saw her again, that impression remained unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a breathtaking woman. While Isa, Clarissa, and Anastasia were all stunning in their own right, they lacked the regal aura that radiated from the leader&mdash;a kind of nobility that made it hard to look directly at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just her presence commanded attention, making everyone around her hold their breath in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We pay respects to Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We pay respects to Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and her fellow practitioners quickly bowed, their expressions filled with reverence and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Fairy Moon Sect was named Adriana Alba!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave them a nod. "Well done! You've brought great glory to our Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes scanned Clarissa and her group. It was as if she could peer straight into their souls, making them feel completely bare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, her gaze settled on Isa, and her eyes lit up with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Isa?" she asked, a smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip once more, seemingly torn, but eventually nodded. "Yes, I'm Isa. Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana smiled and nodded in approval. She said, "Excellent! Would you like to be my disciple and inherit all my life-long knowledge? Your talent is truly outstanding. If you train hard, I promise your future accomplishments will even outshine mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Angela and her fellow practitioners were trembling with excitement, their eyes brimming with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had expected that Adriana would take Isa under her tutelage, but actually seeing it happen was a whole different story, and they couldn't help but feel a twinge of longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana was the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of super-warriors on the entire Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Amber and Angela had once dreamed of becoming her disciples, but they knew they didn't cut the mustard in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Isa, on the verge of becoming Adriana's student.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Isa accepted this offer, her status and identity would skyrocket. She'd soar above them and even outrank many Elders in the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, Isa would be the future junior master of the Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth mentioning that Adriana had only three disciples in total, and the future leader of the Fairy Moon Sect was bound to come from among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Amber, Angela</span><span>,</span><span> and the others not be green with envy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, having already made up her mind, didn't hesitate for a second when she heard Adriana's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded resolutely. "Thank you for thinking of me. I'm willing to be your disciple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana's face broke into a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing, then I'm your teacher from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Alba!" Isa replied, filling Adriana's heart with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana then shifted her focus to Clarissa and her companions. "You all possess Class SS talent, which ranks among the top on the Racial Convergence Planet! Even I only have Class SS talent! We at the Fairy Moon Sect can't afford to let such remarkable talent go to waste!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you like to join the Fairy Moon Sect? Amber and Angela are good teachers, but since fate has brought us together, I'd like to make you an offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't take you as my direct disciples, but I can accept you as my registered disciples! Whenever I have the time, I'll guide your training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you willing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell silent, looking at each other in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana wanted to take them on as registered disciples!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Amber and her fellow practitioners felt a surge of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could come to terms with Isa joining Adriana, thinking they weren't qualified to teach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But how could Ms. Alba also claim Clarissa, Anastasia, and others? Those are our hand-picked students!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was especially panicked. She had already performed the formal gift-sending ceremony for Anastasia, Zoe, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Alba..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana waved her hand with a smile. "I know what you're going to say! You've rendered great service to the Fairy Moon Sect and will be duly rewarded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as for these young talents, you wouldn't be able to guide them to their full potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They will be the deciding factor in whether our Fairy Moon Sect can break through the title of First-rate Power and become the fourth Top-tier Power on the Racial Convergence Planet! That's why I need to mentor them personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sect leader stating her stance, Angela and her fellow practitioners fell silent, a complex blend of disappointment and admiration welling up inside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really wanted to have such talented disciples for themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're willing!" Clarissa and her group didn't hesitate for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with Amber and her fellow practitioners, Adriana was in a league of her own in terms of strength and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming her registered disciples meant a promising future for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt a rush of joy for the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had found a powerful backer, and he no longer had to fret about their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Adriana turned her eyes on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was piercing, as if she were trying to peer into his very soul. But thanks to the Sublime Concealment Orb, she couldn't detect anything out of the ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, she said, "You're Osborne Augustine, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you like to return to the Fairy Moon Sect with me? I can also take you on as a registered disciple..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
