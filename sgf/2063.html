  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's expression darkened as he spotted Osborne among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy dared to cross me and still hasn't left Elf City? How brazen can he get, showing up around me like this? Does he think I won't take him down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought only fueled his anger further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with so many people around, he held his tongue, opting instead to shoot Osborne a cold glare before turning on his heel and walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once back at the Fire Elf Clan assessment site, the strikingly beautiful Princess Monica approached him, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Desmond, who were you staring at just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just some insignificant Human Community pest," he replied coolly, then recounted the earlier events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica scoffed at his words, "An Ascension One human? Definitely a pest! But the fact that he managed to dodge the whip of an Ascension Five guard captain shows he's got some tricks up his sleeve. He must be some kind of genius from a small planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with mischief as she continued, "So, Desmond, are you thinking about getting back at him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're worried about Princess Joanna getting mad? Heh, you might as well give up on Joanna! She clearly sees you as just a friend&mdash;there's no way she'd ever agree to be with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women know women best; you're wasting your time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's expression darkened further at her words. "You really think Joanna could never like me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is that? Am I not good enough? I'm just as talented, with just as much potential and strength as she has, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica let out a derisive laugh. "Women are drawn to strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They only admire men who are significantly stronger than they are! If you're just on the same level in terms of talent, potential, and strength, she'll only see you as a friend or a companion&mdash;never as someone she'd want to spend her life with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you were an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, she'd be all over you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But alas, you're just Ascension Four... so don't waste your time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's frustration boiled over, his fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it! I've worked too hard for too long&mdash;I'm going to win her over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica chuckled, "Desmond, if you just want to win her over, you don't necessarily have to marry her! This upcoming Umbra Earth expedition is your chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's eyes lit up with interest. "</span><span>What</span><span> do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica said, "I can't say it outright! But I think you get what I'm hinting at, right? If you can't win her heart, then at least win her body! Once you've conquered that, you can slowly work on winning her heart too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I can say for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you need help, I'd be more than happy to assist! When we're in Umbra Earth, we could... you know what I mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's eyes sparkled with newfound determination as he regarded Monica. "Monica, you're ruthless! Whoever marries you is going to have their hands full."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica laughed sweetly, "No man is worthy of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one is qualified to marry me! But if you're ready to make a move, just let me know! Oh, and about recruiting members for the exploration team&mdash;can you take care of that for me? I can't stand those guys staring at me; it's disgusting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading to the Emerald Forest Lodge to check on that damn Alfreda. She still hasn't apologized to me, and it's really getting under my skin. I need to see how she's doing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Monica stood up, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond warned urgently, "Monica, be careful! Princess Alfreda is an Ascension Five powerhouse. You don't want to get caught off guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft! So what if she's Ascension Five?" Monica scoffed. "The Nature Elf Clan Royal Family is completely washed up. If she dares to take me on, she'll be the one in trouble! Her father might just send her off to Umbra Earth as punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident sway of her hips, Monica strutted away, leaving Desmond watching her, feeling a heat rise within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan she had suggested earlier lingered in his mind, stirring a mix of anticipation and uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I really go through with it?" he pondered, glancing toward the Sylvan Elf Clan Royal Family and spotting Princess Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Joanna wasn't focused on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of fury welled up in Desmond's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered through clenched teeth, "Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does Joanna see in that lowly Human Community pest? I just walked by, and she didn't even look my way! How infuriating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger flared, igniting a dark desire for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joanna! You're pushing me to do this! After all these years of being ignored, don't blame me for taking action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, human pest&mdash;you can just wait to meet your end! I let you off easy before because of Joanna, but now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't show you any mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Desmond waved his hand, summoning a member of the Fire Elf Clan who rushed over, respect etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond pointed toward Osborne, his voice icy as he issued a few quick instructions. The elf nodded and hurried off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was trying to communicate with Joanna through a mental link.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The requirements for the six Elf Royal Family assessments were strict, with a minimum cultivation level of Ascension Two Supernal Deity King to even apply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne didn't meet that standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, he reached out to Joanna, hoping she could help him find a way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't harbor any strong feelings for her, but he remembered how she had spoken up for him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe, just maybe, she would come through for him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, disappointment washed over him as Joanna's response came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but the registration standards are set by the elders of the Royal Family. For us Sylvan Elf Clan, the minimum is Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you were Ascension Two, I might be able to pull some strings and make an exception. But you're only Ascension One... your cultivation level is far too low! You wouldn't even survive in Umbra Earth. Even as cannon fodder, you wouldn't cut it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mean to sound harsh, but that's just the reality. So, it's best you give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you should leave Elf City right away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already angered Desmond</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>I </span><span>know his temperament, </span><span>and </span><span>he's likely to retaliate. I can help you with this once, but I can't keep doing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all I can say. Whether you heed my warning is up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joanna severed their mental link and turned her attention back to the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had helped Osborne before, but that was only because she couldn't stand seeing Desmond bully the weak&mdash;not because she had any special feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, faced with Osborne's plea for help, she had no qualms about turning him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that she couldn't make an exception; she simply didn't see the need to go out of her way for someone she barely knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head, Joanna refocused on the task at hand, determined to select the strongest teammates for her next expedition into Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne walked away, disappointment etched on his face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
