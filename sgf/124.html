  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Barlyn felt this way, he did not act impulsively and quit his job immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had just started his position the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of missing out on the Glacium Beauty made him feel as if he had missed out on ten billion dollars; his entire body ached with regret, nearly making him sick with remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Austin was still vividly describing how amazing the Glacium Beauty was, making Barlyn feel even more regretful for not tasting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn covered his ears and slumped on the sofa, his eyes vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was distressed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed Barlyn's state and knew his plan had worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he decided to up the ante.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Barlyn, do not be too upset. It is just a bottle of Glacium Beauty. I have something even better. Let me get it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn remained in a daze, not moving at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do not try to comfort me. That was Glacium Beauty! It is the best wine in the world. Missing out on it means I might never have another chance to taste it again. How could there be something better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just let me die in peace."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Barlyn spoke, Osborne said with a faint smile. "Is that so? But my friend gave me a bottle of wine, and Glacium Beauty is just the most ordinary among them. He also gave me something better. What was it called again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, Barlyn sat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glacium Beauty is the most ordinary? What are you talking about? I do not know who your friend is, Osborne, but to say Glacium Beauty is ordinary? And he gave you something better? I do not believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Oh right, I remember now. It's called - Systin. Yes, Systin wine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Barlyn froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Systin? The Systin that has been extinct for decades? The top-tier wine made by the thousand-year-old Systin family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn rushed to Osborne's side, grabbing his arm. His face was flushed with excitement, his body trembling, and his eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, being a true wine connoisseur, knew a lot about top-tier wines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded vigorously, "Yes, that is what my friend said! He told me Systin wine is almost extinct now. You get one bottle less every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that is right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was ecstatic. "Is there really Systin wine? Where is it? Hurry up and show it to me. If it is Systin wine, it is definitely better than Glacium Beauty. You might be able to get Glacium Beauty with money and connections, but Systin is truly a rare gem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, show it to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was practically drooling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, not teasing him further, went to the car and brought out a bottle of Systin wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn immediately treated it like a priceless treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed! It is Systin wine! And it is the most famous one, handcrafted by Master Amos Systin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, this is practically priceless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were on the black market, it could drive countless people crazy. It would not sell for less than a billion dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was overjoyed, laughing heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I missed the Glacium Beauty, but to think I get to taste Systin! Is this God's way of compensating me? Quick, get the glasses ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing Osborne might change his mind, Barlyn quickly uncorked the bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process of letting the wine breathe began again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells so good, different from Glacium Beauty. Glacium Beauty has a gentle fragrance, while Systin's aroma is more intense and direct."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin commented, sniffing the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said with a smile, "That is the difference between Glacium and Equitaria wines. Eastern wines are more subtle, like water, while Western wines are more direct, like fire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop showing off. If you miss out on this because of an emergency, do not cry later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said while rolling her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, no matter what happens, I am not leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face fell as he saw it was Violet calling again. He suddenly felt annoyed and tossed the phone aside, ignoring it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said quickly, "You should answer. What if it is something urgent? Ms. Radcliffe's safety is the top priority since you are the head of security team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne emphasized "head of security team" with a heavy tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin also urged, "Answer it. What if there is an emergency? Clarissa's safety comes first. If something goes wrong, you will regret it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can drink anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Austin both persuaded him, and Barlyn finally nodded and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he jumped up. "What? An expert sneaked into the manor? Knocked out two guards? Our warning system failed? We cannot locate the intruder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect Ms. Radcliffe. I am heading back immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said, rushing out without even saying goodbye to Osborne and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Isa</span><span> Hank, you are reliable!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
