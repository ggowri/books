  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance's voice was laced with arrogance, and his eyes were cold, as if he were a sovereign chastising a mere subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone irked Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne chose to overlook it, stepping away with the intent to quietly await the conclusion of Branch Bloodline Competition, to hand the Heir's Emblem to Caleb, and to put an end to this Chapter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sought no further trouble or unexpected mishaps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, trouble refused to leave him be. Lance did not cool down at Osborne's voluntary concession; instead, his ire grew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said frostily, "Osborne, are you deaf or mute? I'm questioning you, and you dare not respond? How dare you ignore me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could no longer hold his tongue. "Lance, have you lost your mind? If your brain's malfunctioning, seek medical help. Who do you think you are that I must answer you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance was momentarily stunned and turned icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you've gone too far!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Teach him a lesson. Let him know his place!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Lance's commands, a middle-aged man emerged from behind him and launched a silent attack, aiming a punch at Osborne's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anger flickered in Osborne's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Lance was too haughty. I wished no conflict, but I would not cower if provoked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne retaliated with a punch of his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained unmoved, but the middle-aged attacker let out a cry, flying backward and colliding with a boulder near Lance. The boulder then exploded with a thunderous boom, sending shards flying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance's body shimmered with light, deflecting the debris. His face was growing colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You do have some strength. No wonder you're so reckless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, "It seems you're the reckless one. Don't provoke me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his retreat did not deter Lance. With a wave of his hand, Lance commanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ahead! Teach him a lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let him understand who reigns supreme among the Augustine family's nine branch bloodlines and who stands as the paramount figure among the branches!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, a dozen figures behind Lance sprang into action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you enrage Mr. Lance Augustine? You deserve death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Apologize to Mr. Lance Augustine, or you'll lie here forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Lance Augustine is the most brilliant prodigy among the members of the Augustine family and represents the future of Yalynch. Disrespect him, and you'll pay the price now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A barrage of varied attacks hurtled toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was a mask of frost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It never ends, does it? If that's how it is, then let's ignite this war! Do you really think I fear you? If you want me to apologize, you should defeat me first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne spoke, the martial art aura erupted from his form.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attacks slammed into his martial arts aura, causing turbulent ripples but failing to breach it. Osborne's fist, aglow, struck back with ferocity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ninefold Tide Crash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The initial few fighters from Yalynch were instantly overwhelmed by the tidal force. Their defenses were shattered, sending them flying backward and spewing blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pressed on, summoning the Thunder Power with a wave of his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dark clouds thickened overhead, lightning gathering. Osborne opened the Dimensional Space and retrieved a lightning-shaped scepter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the fourth-level ancient magic weapon from the Paltrow family, the Lightning Staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wielding the staff, Osborne felt his control over lightning amplify. With a flick of his wrist, countless bolts of lightning descended upon the remaining fighters from Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their expressions shifted dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They unleashed their strength to resist, but Osborne produced an energy pistol, charged it, and fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The energy pistol possessed formidable penetrating power, piercing through their defenses and leaving gaping wounds. The lightning from above found its mark and struck them down, scorching and splintering their forms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In mere moments, Osborne dispersed the lightning and dark clouds with a wave of his hand. He stowed away his energy pistol and regarded the dozen or so fallen men with a look of cold disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze shifted to Lance, whose face was a picture of displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Care for another round?" Osborne taunted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance's expression was grim, his eyes burning with the desire to retaliate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, he was bound by the rules. As the bearer of the Heir's Emblem, he could not assault the holder of another emblem, at least not until the Branch Bloodline Competition had concluded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Very well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance yelled furiously, "Osborne, I underestimated you. It seems you did indeed use your strength to defeat David and Sam. Regrettably, even as the quasi-heir, you are but the weakest among them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You will pay the price for daring to cross me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Lance fell silent, and Osborne could finally breathe easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gave little thought to offending Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sixth succession trial bestowed upon him by the Godfather demanded that he become the Augustine family's foremost heir. To complete this trial, he knew he would inevitably clash with Lance and others, including Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In comparison, Lance was the most straightforward to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne feared Lance from the branch bloodline, how could Osborne hope to contend with Vincent and Matthew from the main bloodline?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surrender was not the first option for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waited patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the sound of a helicopter signaled Caleb's arrival atop the mountain.</p><div class="pagination">
