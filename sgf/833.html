  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying his piece, Osborne ignored Ebony's furious outbursts and took Clarissa's hand, ready to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're going to regret this!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promise you'll regret it! You'll beg me for forgiveness!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to kill you and your whole family!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's enraged voice came from behind, and Osborne's eyes flashed with a deadly glare as he started to turn around, ready to deal with her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, let it go!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let her keep shouting. Dealing with her now would just be a hassle."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa quickly stepped in, shaking her head with concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated for a moment before nodding reluctantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and Clarissa left, while Ebony continued to fume. When she finally got tired of shouting, she got back into her car and made a video call.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been attacked!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was Osborne from the Augustine family in Rosmandi! The task you gave me was almost a success, but Osborne messed it up. You have to help me get revenge!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You need to help me kill him!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back at the Radcliffe Estate, Donna rushed over when she saw Osborne and Clarissa return. She hugged Clarissa tightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, I'm so glad you're okay."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa smiled warmly and looked at Osborne. "Osborne saved me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Donna's expression was a mix of emotions as she looked at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan and Eugen also looked at Osborne with a new perspective. They had once thought Osborne wasn't worthy of Clarissa, but he had saved them all recently and now had saved Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We should head to Newport City," Osborne said.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those people are a big deal. They are after Clarissa, and they won't give up easily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's find a safe place in Newport City and settle in."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone from the Radcliffe family nodded in agreement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They got into the car, and after a long drive, they finally reached Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the trip, Osborne filled Clarissa in on his recent undercover mission to Tethynia for the Honor Quest Ceremony. He carefully left out the fact that Emma had accompanied him, still unsure how to explain that to Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Clarissa didn't seem to question anything. She was completely engrossed in the Honor Quest Ceremony. She finally got a clear picture of what Godson Rankings and Quasi-Divine Rankings were all about.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was full of concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, is the Thornberry family really as powerful as you say? Is Helios really the strongest person on Earth?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't get into trouble because of what happened with Ebony, will you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel so bad. I'm always causing trouble for you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa looked genuinely remorseful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gently took her hand and said earnestly, "Clarissa, this isn't your fault. You haven't done anything wrong! And don't worry too much. The Thornberry family is powerful, and Helios is strong, but he's not all-powerful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rosmandi isn't a place where they can just do whatever they want!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My family isn't pushovers either. I'll make sure you're safe. If they want to take you, they'll have to get through me first!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's eyes welled up, and she hugged him tightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I don't know what I'd do without you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, she looked up and gave him a soft kiss.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne held her waist and savored every moment. Soon, he felt a wave of heat and a noticeable physical reaction, with his member pressing against Clarissa's lower abdomen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face turned bright red with embarrassment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she didn't shy away. Instead, she bravely knelt down and took him in her warm embrace, gently enveloping him with her lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne drew in a sharp breath, lost in the warmth of Clarissa's embrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though this wasn't their first intimate moment, each time felt new and irresistible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eventually, they settled down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa snuggled into Osborne's arms, her cheeks still flushed. She changed the topic, trying to hide her lingering shyness. "Osborne, are you really going ahead with the Honor Quest Ceremony? Is there anything I can do to help?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, the Honor Quest Ceremony is in two weeks. The Augustine family's invitations should be sent out to all the major powers soon."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A lot of top young talents will be coming to Newport City. You're strong, but you lack experience. With your skills, you shouldn't have had trouble with Ebony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When the time comes, the Augustine family will host the Godson Challenge. You should give it a shot to gain more experience."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet started vibrating, and his expression changed.</p><div class="pagination">
