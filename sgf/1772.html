  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, two days passed, but inside Hope Haven, a staggering two hundred days unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that time, Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, and the others experienced rapid growth in their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, once a warrior reached the Deity King level, their progress slowed significantly, requiring years of relentless effort to advance further. However, with the ample supply of Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs at their disposal, their rate of improvement not only remained steady but accelerated, with each day marking new breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two hundred days finally came to an end, each of them had transformed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mastery over dark, spatial, and lightning elemental essences had all surged to the peak of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to where he stood two hundred days ago, he had jumped an entire level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This remarkable leap cost him thirty blue Miracle Elixirs&mdash;an impressive feat, considering that even the most gifted talents from Paramount Supreme Clan typically received only one Miracle Elixir every decade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two hundred days, Osborne had consumed thirty of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, and the others had used slightly fewer elixirs, averaging around twenty each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, the group had consumed two hundred Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The investment paid off. While their gains varied based on the types of elixirs used, each member had experienced a significant boost in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of raw strength, Anastasia remained the strongest among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had reached the mid-stage of Deity King. Her Divine Body was still at Level Nine, and her lightning elemental essence matched Osborne's, also peaking at Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next one was Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had achieved the early pinnacle of Deity King, with her Divine Body reaching the peak of Level Eight and her light elemental essence also hitting Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe and Kendra followed closely, both at the early pinnacle of Deity King as well. However, their Divine Bodies were slightly weaker than Mila's, only at the later stages of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's soul elemental essence had reached the later stage of Level Eight, while Kendra's fire elemental essence was similarly positioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce and Diana were at the same level, both at the early pinnacle of Deity King, but their Divine Bodies were at the mid-stage of Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's water elemental essence had climbed to the later stage of Level Eight, and Diana's earth elemental essence matched that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In summary, everyone had made noticeable strides in their cultivation level and Divine Bodies, but the biggest leaps were seen in their elemental essences, all reaching the later stages of Level Eight, with some even peaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had also made significant progress, surpassing both Bryce and Diana, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Kendra and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most impressively, her elemental powers were stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had simultaneously trained in dark power and life power, both reaching the later stage of Level Eight, putting her strength on par with Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these two hundred days, their training wasn't limited to solitary breakthroughs. They carved out time each day to spar with one another, honing their combat skills and gaining invaluable practical experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their duels were no holds barred, and even if they sustained injuries, Hannah's life power could swiftly heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone was hurt too badly, Osborne could tap into Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to restore them. Having completed the eighth layer of fusion with the lotus, he could now easily channel its powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he couldn't grant them immortality just yet, he was getting close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how serious the injuries were, Osborne could ensure a quick recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end, Osborne not only engaged directly in their training but also encouraged the Blood Demon members to join in the sparring sessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group had to adapt to fighting against the relentless onslaught of the Blood Demon members, learning to handle the pressure of being surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final results of these encounters were often brutal, but the lessons learned were invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Blood Demon members now have three hundred who have broken through to the Deity King realm, while the rest are at the peak Deity Overlord stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their coordination and cooperation, combined with their near-immortality, meant that even if Anastasia, Zoe, and the other eight team up and went all out, they wouldn't stand a chance against the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the most terrifying was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over these two hundred days, he not only advanced his realm to the peak of early-stage Deity King but also elevated his elemental essence to the peak of Level Eight. He has also refined and enhanced a multitude of power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spatial Clone had reached Level Seven, allowing him to create sixty-four Spatial Clones at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clone could wield his spatial power and possessed at least sixty percent of Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Spatial Clone could effortlessly defeat and dominate Mila, Zoe, and Kendra. Only Anastasia, when pushing herself to the limit, could hold her ground against his clones for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bit of luck, she might occasionally defeat one of Osborne's Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the biggest weakness of the clones was their average defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Undead Cataclysm had also reached Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this level, he could summon a million powerful Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these Dark Undead was as strong as a peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's greatest trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, even Osborne himself felt a bit insane about his current state. He could single-handedly take on an entire Dark Deity Legion with ease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
