  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia stood frozen in a state of bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, they had been facing imminent danger, their prospects dim as Vance and his crew were reluctant to lend a hand. They knew they wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they somehow survived the onslaught from the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, they would inevitably fall prey to Vance and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their hearts, despair had begun to take root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the course of events changed in an instant. The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, which had just been attacking them with wild abandon, suddenly seemed to overlook their presence, redirecting their fury toward Vance's group instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very spectators who had been so relaxed just moments ago now found themselves in grave peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Vance's desperate call for help, Harry couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help you? Are you out of your mind, Vance? Or do you think I am? Why on earth would I want to help you? This chaos is exactly what I was hoping for. Don't worry, I won't let you die easily. I need to be the one to finish you off myself. Once those </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> have left you battered and bruised, I plan to take great pleasure in removing your head from your shoulders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance nearly choked on his own frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's words echoed his own from earlier, but now the tables had turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration boiled within him as he faced the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, its sheer strength making it far too formidable. It easily pierced through his defenses, and its reckless tenacity made every attempt at retaliation futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Vance was stained with his own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His companions fared little better. With eight Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and a swarm of Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> closing in, their situation was dire as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a blood-curdling scream pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Vance's allies staggered, unable to withstand the assault. A </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> claw tore effortlessly through his defenses, leaving a gruesome gash across his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Organs spilled forth, and the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, sensing the heightened essence of life, lunged at the stricken warrior's throat, ravenously draining their blood and feasting on his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victim's cries echoed in the chaos, his strength fading rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide was turning further against Vance's group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, why are those </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> ignoring us? It's like they can't see us," Amelia asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry shook his head, equally perplexed. "I have no idea. This is a first for me, too. But honestly, it's working out in our favor. Maybe... </span><span>it's</span><span> Dad's spirit watching over us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He excavated this path. If it's not his blessing, I can't explain why they're suddenly overlooking us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia frowned, still uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed around, feeling an inexplicable sense that something&mdash;or someone&mdash;was helping them, even if she couldn't quite grasp it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever you are, thank you for your help," Amelia whispered quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned back to the brutal battle before them, determination flaring in her eyes. "Harry, we need to intervene! Vance and the others stand no chance against these </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>. If they get wiped out, what's stopping the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> from turning back on us? We'll be in a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We either need to make a run for it or jump in and take out some </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> ourselves! Let's make sure both sides take a hit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry hesitated, wrestling with his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worried that action would provoke the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to notice them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, he gritted his teeth, resolved. "Let's do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> must be all the ones within a 12-mile radius! If we can take them all out, this area will be completely secure. We could mine for Essence Crystals here for a long time without worrying about danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, heading back out might seem safer, but we'd probably never have the guts to venture deep into the mine again. Without enough Essence Crystals, we won't meet our quota in seven days, and Patrick won't let us off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's now or never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Harry finished speaking, he urged Amelia to keep her distance, ready to bolt if things went south. He began to assess the weaker </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, choosing his targets carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on controlling the numbers, ensuring that the overall strength of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was greater than Vance and his crew, yet not overwhelmingly so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, once Vance and his team were taken down, the remaining </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> wouldn't be too many for him and Amelia to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, they could finish off the rest and mine for Essence Crystals without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a clever strategy, one that would inadvertently benefit Osborne as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, the moment of opportunity had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> fell, they left behind a rich residue of high-grade death scent&mdash;exactly what he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Harry and the others wouldn't dare go near it, Osborne lurked in the shadows, letting the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity secretly absorb the essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more high-grade death scent the Lotus consumed, the more its roots would recover, hastening the healing of Osborne's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne had his sights set on the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, anticipation bubbling within him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
