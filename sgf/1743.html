  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment darkness descended, Aldrich's expression shifted dramatically, shock washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who truly trained in dark power understood what Eclipse of Eternity represented&mdash;a sign of exceptional talent and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among all practitioners of dark power, only a select few had managed to master Eclipse of Eternity, including the formidable Lord Malevolence and the God of Night from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich thought, relief flooding through him, "Thank goodness. He must have just grasped Eclipse of Eternity. He can't possibly wield its true terror yet. At least for now, it shouldn't pose too much of a threat to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, Aldrich regarded Osborne as a formidable enemy, one who stood on equal footing with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such talent and potential, if he's allowed to grow, the Human Community could very well see the rise of another God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The esteemed Lord Malevolence once said that only the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community could be considered his rivals, and among them, only the God of Night was worthy of his caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If more figures like the God of Night emerge from the Human Community, the esteemed Lord Malevolence would never descend upon Celestara with us; he would flee at the first sign of danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must eliminate him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cannot allow this guy to grow stronger! The Human Community must not gain another 'God of Night'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's eyes glinted with murderous intent as he prepared to unleash his full power to shatter Osborne's Eclipse of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to strike, a sudden wave of intense danger washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Aldrich shifted to full defensive mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the very fabric of space around him collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a mid-stage Deity King, Aldrich was rocked by the imploding space, his head spinning and vision blurring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his defenses held strong; with the Supreme Malevolence Shield in place, he managed to absorb most of the collapsing force, sparing him from disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the shock in his eyes was impossible to conceal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the signature move of the God of Space among the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? You possess spatial power and have mastered a technique only the God of Space should wield? Dark power and spatial power? How can they both be this strong?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich growled, his gaze locked on Osborne and his eight Spatial Clones, his face a mask of disbelief. It was as if he was witnessing the fusion of the God of Night and the God of Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night was the strongest among the Seven Great Deity Kings, deemed by the Lord Malevolence as the only one worthy of his respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the God of Space and the God of Time were known for being particularly troublesome opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, showcasing the signature moves of both the God of Night and the God of Space. How could Aldrich not be stunned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as all eight Spatial Clones attacked simultaneously, only to find that they couldn't seriously injure Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's still too much of a gap in realms! I need to break through to Deity King as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, facing a mid-stage Deity King will be this difficult! What will happen when I confront a late-stage or peak Deity King? I won't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne faced Aldrich and said, "Surprised? This world is vast, and nothing is impossible! But that won't matter to you soon enough because you're about to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's face darkened at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this had been earlier, he would have laughed off Osborne's threats, thinking Osborne foolish and overconfident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after battling Osborne and witnessing his endless array of hidden cards, along with his terrifying talent and potential, Aldrich no longer saw him as delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne genuinely had the potential to kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich replied, his tone grave, "Alright, alright! If I can take down a talent like you from the Human Community, even the esteemed Lord Malevolence would have to reward me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who ends up killing whom! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two warriors clashed once more, but this time, Osborne was supported by his eight clones, launching a coordinated assault on Aldrich. No longer could Aldrich handle the fight with ease; despite pouring all his strength into defense, he could only barely keep Osborne at bay. Inflicting serious damage or finishing him off was utterly out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration began to gnaw at Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne remained composed, biding his time and waiting for the perfect opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, as Aldrich's anxiety began to show, a crack in his defenses appeared. The moment Osborne had been waiting for had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Stasis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, unleashing his time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, time froze around them&mdash;but only Aldrich was caught in the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Osborne and his eight Spatial Clones unleashed their most powerful attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
