  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose's strength was formidable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what made Mose truly terrifying was his killing technique. As a top-tier assassin, the closer the distance, the deadlier he became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Osborne had to be cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was prepared. If Mose made sudden moves, he would instantly use spatial manipulation to stretch the space between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For most, it would be difficult to unleash their abilities that quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne could do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa used a special technique to fuse Osborne's soul of powers with his body, allowing him to use his abilities far faster than others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially for moves like spatial stretching, which required no energy buildup, he could activate them instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why he dared to face Mose without fear of his threats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Osborne and Mose's bodies were tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt like their battle could break out at any moment. When it did, it would be deadly life or death, winner or loser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people noticed the tension between them, glancing over in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Mose didn't make a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He let out a cold snort, reining in his murderous intent. "Very well! Axell, you've piqued my interest. If I don't get to mount your head in my trophy room, I won't sleep peacefully!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As I said, our battlefield isn't here. It's out in the wild!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The moment you leave the Williamson Castle will be the day you die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those icy words, Mose stopped paying attention to Osborne and turned toward the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly, completely unbothered by Mose's threats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be waiting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he, too, turned his gaze toward the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the Honor Quest Ceremony had begun. The head of the Williamson family had made a speech, but Osborne didn't pay any attention to what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His focus was still on Mose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Mose had said he wouldn't strike here and would assassinate him outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how could Osborne fully trust that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It could very well be Mose's scheme. He would lull Osborne into lowering his guard and then launch a deadly attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had no intention of dying in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Eityreia Organization, the top-ranked assassin group in the world, feared by countless powerful factions, definitely had real skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As confident as Osborne was, he wouldn't underestimate Mose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted in noise at that moment, and everyone turned to the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A tall, muscular figure slowly made his way onto the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Cuthbert Williamson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The strongest of the younger generation, ranked 36th on the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's finally making an appearance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Honor Quest Ceremony is truly beginning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at Cuthbert and immediately felt an overwhelming power emanating from him, like a massive mountain. His aura was immense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert walked to the center, his gaze sharp as he looked at the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you all for attending my Honor Quest Ceremony," Cuthbert began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't waste time on unnecessary words! My Honor Quest Ceremony starts now! Anyone who wants to challenge me can step onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At this stage, there is no life or death, only victory or defeat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you defeat me by any means, you'll win an ancient artifact from the Williamson family and a five trillion dollars fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope all of you will push me, help me break through to S-class!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished, a brilliant light flared in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Cuthbert spoke, the crowd below the stage grew eager to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who wouldn't be tempted by an ancient artifact and five trillion dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they knew their chances of defeating Cuthbert before he was severely weakened were slim, the prize made it worth a shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And with no rules regarding life or death on the stage, they had nothing to fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing a top-tier fighter like Cuthbert was a rare opportunity in itself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert Williamson, I challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a figure leaped onto the stage, facing Cuthbert with intense determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, let's fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he attacked immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was at the Class AAA but hadn't mastered domain power yet. Even so, he was no ordinary AAA fighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, he unleashed his full power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His terrifying attack caused the ground and sky to tremble, rushing toward Cuthbert with ferocity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the attack was about to hit him, Cuthbert countered with a casual punch, shattering the fierce strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shockwave from his punch hit his opponent, sending him flying off the stage with a scream, unable to control his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wins!</p><div class="pagination">
