  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't you think this is too risky? I'm not going to risk my life with you on this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't explicitly say it was a suicide mission, but that was what she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finding Raymond's hideout?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we strike him first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we even need to capture Raymond alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could Osborne dare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even I wouldn't dare!" Donna couldn't help but think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous assassination attempts, they had barely managed to fend him off by relying on their advantageous terrain, and that was at a significant cost. Taking the initiative would likely have only one outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have Raymond's knack for escaping death. She wasn't ready to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you won't need to lift a finger. Just help us locate Raymond, and I'll lead Bodyguard Units Three and Four to handle the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Barlyn suddenly said, "I think Osborne is right. The best defense is a good offense. As long as Raymond is not captured, we won't have peace, and Clarissa won't even dare to step outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sick of living like this, not to mention how Clarissa feels!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The worst part is, we don't even know why The Aberrants want to kill Clarissa! Mom, I don't know what you think, but I can't accept this. I've decided to join Osborne and take the initiative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned. "Nonsense! You're heading to your doom! Do you have any idea how many experts Raymond has with him? Do you know how strong he is? You know nothing, yet you dare talk about taking the initiative. How is that any different from seeking death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn retorted indignantly, "Osborne and I are not weak either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa also frowned, her face filled with concern. "Barlyn, stop it. This time, I think Aunt Donna is right. Taking the initiative might solve the problem better, but it's too dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "I don't want anything to happen to you, any of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clarissa spoke, Barlyn fell silent and looked sullenly towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel that Clarissa was genuinely worried about their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was also doubting their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you've faced Raymond three times. How would you rate his strength compared to yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't understand Osborne's intention but answered truthfully, "Raymond's strength is about the same as mine. We're both Class C+ metahumans, very skilled in controlling our powers. But my earth elemental powers can weaken his thunder powers, so he can't do much to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I can't quite catch him either; he's too fast for me," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "So, you're saying Raymond's as tough as you. How about Barlyn and I spar with you? If we can beat you together, will you agree to my proposal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna paused, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, smirking disdainfully, she retorted, "You and Barlyn teaming up to beat me? Osborne, you're pretty delusional!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though Barlyn is a Class C metahuman, and you once defeated the Class C martial artist, Paul, making you a Class C powerhouse, do you really think two Class Cs together can beat a Class C+?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of a Class C+ is far beyond a Class C!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if there were five of you teaming up, you still wouldn't be my match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face was full of confidence, even arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew she was right. A Class C+ metahuman could completely crush a Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, he said, "Since Ms. Donna Radcliffe is so confident, let's give it a try! It will be good to see the extent of Ms. Donna Radcliffe's abilities for myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression chilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met Donna's gaze fearlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn tugged at his arm and whispered, "Osborne, my mom's probably right. It's going to be tough for the two of us to win against her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa spoke up with concern. "Osborne, don't be rash. Aunt Donna isn't belittling you. She's actually telling the truth. She's worried about hurting you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a slight smile. "I know, but how can we know for sure we're not a match unless we try? I want to give it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna snorted coldly and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Osborne, since you're overestimating yourself and challenging me, I'll give you the chance! I'll show you just how ridiculous your proposal to capture Raymond actively is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to the shooting range!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Donna led the way out of the villa and into the vast shooting range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood beside Barlyn while Donna positioned herself 328 feet opposite them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, accompanied by a group of guards, watched anxiously from the platform above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, be careful not to hurt Barlyn and Osborne!" Clarissa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Clarissa's words, Donna's face darkened. "Osborne, again? The more she says it, the more affectionate it sounds. How can I stand this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, get ready to be crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she struck swiftly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
