  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan said in horror, "Right, right there! There is one last batch of Originium. We were going to retreat after delivering this batch of Originium."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan pointed at a helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows. Then he stared at the helicopter and moved it nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter landed in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened the helicopter and immediately found a tightly sealed metal box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne checked and found that it was locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I open it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan said in horror, "We need a special key, which should be on the two dukes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and soon found a special key from the body of a Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked finally before opening the metal box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that some special metals were radioactive and very dangerous. Although with his current strength, he was not afraid of such danger at all, he still needed to be careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he still didn't know what the Originium was. Even the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> cared so much about it, so it must be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan quickly shook his head, "No, there is no danger! Originium is very common. There is no danger at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Clarissa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded, "He didn't lie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Osborne feel at ease and slowly opened the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa both looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, both of them were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this... isn't this pyrite? Is this what the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of square metal blocks neatly placed in the metal box. Osborne could recognize at a glance that this was the most common pyrite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pyrite, also known as "fool's gold", was an iron sulfide that exists in nature with the most perfect cubic structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pyrite was very common, not rare, and had very low value. Apart from the fact that it was naturally square, which is a bit rare, there was nothing special about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wanted was pyrite?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned cold. He stared at the Marquis Titan and sneered, "How dare you play tricks on me? Even if I send a thousand tons or ten thousand tons of this ordinary pyrite to the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, he won't even look at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me this is why you're willing to go to war?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was murderous intent in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan was extremely frightened and quickly said, "I didn't lie to you! We really came here for it! Moreover, it is not pyrite. It is different from pyrite. It is Originium!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, that's what the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> calls it! As for the difference between it and pyrite, I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> gave us a special instrument that can distinguish between ordinary pyrite and Originium! Only real Originium can make the instrument </span><span>react!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Marquis Titan finished speaking, he quickly took out an instrument the size of a palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne checked it and found that it was just an ordinary metal analyzer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought the instrument close to the pyrite in the iron box, and immediately the instrument began to flash red lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go find some common pyrite for comparison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, no need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this time, Clarissa stopped Osborne, her pretty face looking a little solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure these are not pyrites! I can feel a very strange and terrifying power inside them! This power is extremely obscure, but if you sense it carefully, you should be able to sense it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face suddenly changed when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly did it, and Osborne's face changed after a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, he also felt a strange and terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really not pyrite?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Originium?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> want to do with these </span><span>Originiums</span><span>? This matter is probably not simple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel that the energy in the Originium was very terrifying, but no matter what he did, he could not trigger it. Maybe that was the reason why the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wanted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must tell the Godfather about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't figure out what the Originium was used for, but with the Godfather's help, he might be able to find it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, notify No. 1 and ask them to take over this rare metal mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll contact the Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne walked aside and contacted the Godfather via the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he took the initiative to contact the Godfather.</span></p><div class="pagination">
