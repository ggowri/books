  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, how dare you! I&hellip;&rdquo; Alison was about to speak, but Osborne stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alison, don&rsquo;t waste time. Time will tell. Look, the uncut diamond that worth 15 million dollars is about to be cut.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s words made everyone look at the cutting machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were no longer in the mood to mock Osborne. They looked over expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The uncut diamond, which Wesley selected, was finally cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley rushed over eagerly. &ldquo;Get out of the way. Let me see it first.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked excited as if he had already seen the beautiful green after the uncut diamond was cut, as if he had already seen a large number of top-quality diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia quickly followed. She was also full of anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison frowned and whispered, &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, if they really cut out top-grade diamond, Luna Jewelry will be in trouble. The Caldwell Group will become famous and seize our business.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled when he heard that. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. They don&rsquo;t look well today. It seems they have no luck in getting top-grade diamond. I guess they can only get a look of disappointment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was stunned. &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, are you a fortune-teller?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne touched his nose and said, &ldquo;Anyway, they are going to be unlucky today. But you are different. You are going to be very lucky today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison tried hard not to roll her eyes. Why didn&rsquo;t she feel that she was going to be lucky?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, there was a sudden noise in front. Alison quickly looked over nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Will it really be possible to cut out top-quality diamond?&rdquo; Alison was worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were too many people around. Alison was too embarrassed to squeeze in. She couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the noise became more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How can it be!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why is this the result? This shouldn&rsquo;t happen. Why is there such a big crack?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. The crack has gone all the way through.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Even the color disappeared. This should worth 10 million dollars. But now it is worth less than one million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a huge loss!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Alison heard the voices of the crowd, she was immediately surprised. She didn&rsquo;t care about anything else and rushed over. She wanted to see the situation with her own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, she saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were both standing blankly beside the cut diamond. They looked extremely gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That uncut diamond was worthless now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t even worthy of the mid-range ones. I won&rsquo;t buy it even its price is two hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison, who had been suppressed for a long time, couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What a rubbish. You spent fifteen million dollars. But you got this kind of garbage. Wesley, Ophelia, I really pity you.&rdquo; Alison&rsquo;s unscrupulous ridicule made the two of them mad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They looked at Alison with eyes as sharp as knives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alison, don&rsquo;t be so proud. The uncut diamonds you asked Osborne to choose have also been cut. I want to see if yours is garbage.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was outraged. The uncut diamonds he picked with great confidence turned out to be a pile of garbage. He spent fifteen million dollars. But now, there was no need to keep cutting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley saw the deep disappointment in Ophelia&rsquo;s eyes, he knew that he could no longer hope to celebrate in the five-star hotel tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison&rsquo;s unscrupulous ridicule was like pouring a bucket of gasoline on his anger. Wesley suddenly became even angrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I want to see what kind of garbage you can cut out of the uncut diamonds you picked. Maybe yours are not as good as mine,&rdquo; Wesley shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison sneered, &ldquo;Even if I cut out a bunch of garbage here, at least I&rsquo;m not as stupid as you to spend 15 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck you. Stop talking nonsense.&rdquo; Wesley was so angry that his fingers were shaking. He almost asked the bodyguards to teach Alison a lesson, but he finally forced himself to hold back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Six pieces of uncut diamonds selected by Osborne had been cut. But the cover of the cutting machine had not been opened yet. So they couldn&rsquo;t see the inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled slightly and nodded. &ldquo;Open them one by one. Otherwise, this spendthrift is going to be pissed off.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley growled, &ldquo;Asshole, I am not the spendthrift.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged and sneered, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a spendthrift? That day at the auction, you gave me 60 million dollars for free. Today you spent another 15 million dollars to buy a bunch of garbage. If this is not considered a spendthrift, then what is?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; Wesley cursed angrily. But he found that he could not find any reason to refute. In just these few days, Wesley had spent nearly 100 million dollars but got nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Wesley almost fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Ashford family was one of the top five wealthy families in Mayby City. If Wesley were born into an ordinary wealthy family, its capital chain would probably have been broken. Even the Ashford family couldn&rsquo;t afford his spending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley wondered, <span style="font-style: italic;">I can imagine that The Wise Order must be extremely dissatisfied with me. If I fail to achieve some results in a short period of time, I am afraid my position as heir will be unstable. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It&rsquo;s all Osborne&rsquo;s fault</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> I feel that I have been unlucky since I </span><span style="font-style: italic;">came into contact with</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Osborne. Osborne seems to be my nemesis. I&rsquo;ll kill him sooner or later</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked at the first cutting machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne asked Alison to open the cover of the cutting machine.</p><div class="pagination">
