  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel that Bram was giving it his all. He had pulled out all the stops, leaving a series of fine, intricate wounds on Osborne's Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even this relentless assault was insufficient to truly wound Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, Bram had no hope of killing Osborne. Although Osborne was only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, logically, he should have been outclassed in a war of attrition against Bram, who was an Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was different. Osborne's divine power was no less formidable than Bram's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, with his Infinite Devouring Eyes always at work, replenishing his divine power, it was clear that in a battle of attrition, the one who would tire first would undoubtedly be Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram had no right to compete in terms of endurance; his current situation was precarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's Multi-thunder Chainstorm encircling him, he found himself trapped within a cage of crackling lightning. While the storm couldn't entirely breach Bram's defenses, it severely drained his strength and confined him to a limited area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as the terrifying lightning carved a path around Bram, forming his prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Shadow Drakes surged forth, serving to further undermine Bram's confidence. Although the Drakes were slow and easily dodged, their numbers piled up quickly. With every passing moment, the safe spaces for him to evade narrowed, and soon he was on the verge of being overwhelmed by the growing tide of Shadow Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?!" Bram exclaimed, horror etched across his face as he frantically tried to dodge the relentless assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram had to continuously channel his divine power for defense; otherwise, the sheer strength of the lightning strikes would leave him severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His panic was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King! How can I possibly lose to you? I won't lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his desperate insistence, it did little to improve his dire circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bram tried to evade, it quickly turned into a futile dance of dodges. He was now forced to attack blindly, trying to destroy the Shadow Drakes closing in on him. But every clash sent shockwaves through Bram, the backlash causing his limbs to tingle with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your dark energy...how is it so powerful?" He was genuinely astonished now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled, unconcerned with Bram's questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was contemplating whether to unleash his spatial power to finish Bram off quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence, enhanced by the Spatial Gold Crystal, had reached a formidable late Level Nine, vastly eclipsing the strength of his dark and lightning elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he decided to tap into that power, taking down Bram wouldn't be a challenge at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite this tempting prospect, Osborne restrained himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an unsettling feeling creeping up on him&mdash;a sense that he was being watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if someone or something lurking in the shadows had its eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he mused, "Could Bram have allies nearby? Or are there other warriors in the vicinity, watching the fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't expose all my cards without knowing if they're friend or foe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought racing through his mind, Osborne began scanning for whoever might be lurking in the shadows while simultaneously intensifying his assault to finish off Bram as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aah!" Bram finally found himself cornered, besieged by the relentless Shadow Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-frightened figures morphed into an overwhelming force, their ferocity crashing down upon him as his divine power defenses shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling wave of pain washed over Bram as the ghastly power struck him, leaving behind grievous injuries that had him coughing up blood repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Damn it all!" he roared, frustration and rage spilling over as he struggled against the tide closing in around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Shadow Drakes crashed repeatedly into Bram, creating violent explosions with each collision. Accompanied by the relentless strikes of thunder from above, Bram quickly turned into a bloodied mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he couldn't afford to continue the offensive, he reluctantly canceled his Divine Ascendance Technique and redirected all his energy into defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the moment Osborne had been waiting for&mdash;a chance to strike when his opponent was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip on the Bloodwrought Bow, a wicked grin forming on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning arrows and dark arrows tore through the air like projectiles, raining down on Bram and making a dire situation even worse for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows pierced Bram's body, sending him flying across the battlefield, blood spraying as massive wounds opened on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed to the ground hard, only to be engulfed by a horde of Shadow Drakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky buzzed with the fury of bolts of lightning, encasing his position in an electrifying storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow Drakes, lightning, and Osborne's unstoppable arrows continued to rain down on the injured Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bram's complexion turned pale as the stench of death clung to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, even with his incredible vitality, such onslaughts would be enough to obliterate him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't die!" Bram bellowed, rage boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Bram's mind, there was no way he would be taken down by a younger warrior of lower rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reality sank in hard, and there was little he could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his desperate state, the only option left was to call for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine, save me!" he cried, his voice echoing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened immediately at the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even brace himself, an icy chill enveloped him, a sinister pressure crashing down, making him grunt and halt his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a figure appeared near Bram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, a daunting force erupted, shattering Osborne's Multi-thunder Chainstorm and sending the Shadow Drakes flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Icy Nine pulled Bram from the wreckage, and a cold smirk crept onto his face as he surveyed the battered figure before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram, taking a moment to collect himself, could only bow his head in humility, grateful for the intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for saving me! That damned guy&mdash;he's trouble! He's definitely more dangerous than you claimed, far worse than the so-called leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, Theodore! We have to eliminate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine let out a scoff. "Fool! Don't you even realize who beat you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's none other than the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' leader&mdash;Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy gaze locked onto Osborne, hatred flickering deep within his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or perhaps 'Theodore' is just a name you're using? Your face before was a disguise? Am I right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your reckless ambush of Osric at Epochal Divine Peak, you were the one who caused our defeat at the hands of the Creation Herald, losing nearly thirty Supernal Deity Kings, weren't you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weight of Icy Nine's words fell upon him, Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure lurking in the shadows had indeed been Bram's ally, and it turned out to be Icy Nine&mdash;the Ascension Five Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had witnessed Icy Nine's incredible strength firsthand. He was a powerhouse capable of going toe-to-toe with the Creation Herald's avatar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he even a match for Icy Nine now? Osborne had no clue, but he felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When confronted with Icy Nine's accusatory glare, he simply replied with a calm chuckle, "You can say whatever you want. I didn't expect you, Icy Nine, one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, to come all the way to the West Zone just to cause trouble. Aren't you afraid the God of Light will discover you and keep you here permanently?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
