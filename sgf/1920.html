  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unique shape of the Central Zone reminded Osborne of the Cosmos Symbol from the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's just a coincidence. After all, the Blue Planet is a fragment of Celestara! Perhaps the Cosmos Symbol was inspired by the Central Zone here..." he mused, but he didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pinpointing his destination, he activated his interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two divine peaks in the Central Zone were known as the Primordial Divine Peak and the Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne set his sights on the Primordial Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he neared the Primordial Divine Peak, he was taken aback by just how enormous and majestic it was compared to the Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nearly ten times the size of the other divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even from 60 thousand miles away, he could feel a weighty presence pressing down on him, as if the very air was thicker with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Osborne most was that his Satan's Eye was being suppressed near the Primordial Divine Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, his Satan's Eye had reached Level Ten, allowing him to see clearly into the core regions of any divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here, it could only show him the surrounding 60 thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything beyond that remained shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, seeing 60 thousand miles isn't too shabby! I'll just stick to searching the perimeter for Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals... and wow, the density of Miracle Elixirs here is off the charts! It's way higher than other divine peaks! Not to mention, most of them are yellow and blue Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't hide his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he desperately needed yellow Miracle Elixirs to boost the Divine Body and blue Miracle Elixirs to enhance elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both types were scarce at other divine peaks, but here at the Primordial Divine Peak, they seemed abundant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a quick glance revealed thousands of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering he was only viewing a small corner of the Primordial Divine Peak, Osborne couldn't help but wonder how many more he'd find by exploring the entire perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne launched into an enthusiastic harvesting spree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed a number of warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan and various other factions cautiously exploring the area, each moving at a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Osborne operated with a speed and efficiency that was on a whole other level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid them no mind, reveling in the delightful bounty of Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers kept climbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by clearing out one tiny corner of the Primordial Divine Peak, he collected over 20 thousand Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a huge win for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, at the most fruitful of divine peaks, he had never even seen such returns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is only one corner of the Primordial Divine Peak&mdash;about ten percent of the area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I manage to scour the entire perimeter, my haul could reach 200 thousand&mdash;and maybe even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, Celestial Crystals will contribute to the total," he thought, adrenaline pumping through him as he envisioned the riches still to be uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just this one-tenth of the perimeter area, Osborne had already harvested over 30 million Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, during his expeditions across the South Zone, East Zone, and North Zone, he had combed through 29 divine peaks and only managed to gather 70 million Celestial Crystals in total. Now, after sifting through merely the outer edge of the Primordial Divine Peak, he was already well past 30 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I complete the entire search, will my total Celestial Crystal haul exceed 300 million? Whoa!" Osborne gasped, a chill running down his spine, and his breath quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Divine Peak was astonishingly bountiful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. "Lord Malevolence controls the Central Zone and these two divine peaks! With such riches here, it's no wonder the Paramount Supreme Clan never runs short of Celestial Crystals or Miracle Elixirs. The Human Community, struggling to survive in the West Zone, can't even compare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, we will defeat Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion and reclaim the Central Zone for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, I need to keep searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's something unsettling about this Primordial Divine Peak, like I'm being watched. I should wrap this up and get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne picked up the pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals continued to rise rapidly. It took him three full days to thoroughly scour the vast perimeter of the Primordial Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the results exceeded his wildest expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had collected a staggering 230 thousand Miracle Elixirs and over 360 million Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a goldmine! I won't have to worry about Miracle Elixirs or Celestial Crystals for a long time! Just need to finish up this last area, and then I'm outta here!" Osborne thought as he approached the final section.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, he surveyed the surroundings, taking in every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a sudden jolt of shock coursed through him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
