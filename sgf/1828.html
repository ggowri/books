  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's face had lost its usual color, his pallor revealing his frantic state of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite his visible panic, he shouted, "What are you babbling about?! Who do you think you are? How dare you slander the Radiant Era Syndicate? We've answered the God of Light's call numerous times, charging into battle against the Dark Deity Legion, earning countless merits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare accuse us of betraying the Human Community and colluding with the Dark Deity Legion? Leaking intelligence to them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is slander! I'll take this straight to the Sanctum of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the esteemed God of Light judge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smirked at Orlando's outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with his tone icy, "Save your breath. What I've said may not be spot-on, but it's close enough. And you know what? I don't even care about the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radiant Era Syndicate? You're just a small fry, barely worth my time. Even if you were colluding with the Dark Deity Legion, I wouldn't bother digging deeper. I'd just wipe you out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I'm really interested in is how the Baxter family, your so-called 'backing,' managed to get tangled with the Dark Deity Legion. Maybe I can find some proof of their betrayal through you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finished, his smirk widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's panic intensified. His body trembled as he stammered, "You... You can't be serious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is insane! Who are you? First, you slander the Radiant Era Syndicate, and now you dare accuse the Baxter family? Do you have any idea who the Baxter family is? They're one of the ten great families of the Human Community! A Dukedom Level Power! They're at the forefront of fighting the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To accuse them of betrayal? You'll tear the heart out of the Human Community if you spread such lies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Baxter family ever hears about this, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I'm slandering the Baxter family or not... Well, you know the truth, I know it, and even the Baxter family knows it. But none of that really matters anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice turned cold as he added, "Because you won't live to see that day. Darren, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's command, Darren's eyes reddened with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward, looming over Orlando like an avenging specter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's fear was palpable. "Darren! You wouldn't dare! I'm with the Baxter family; you know their power! Touch a hair on my head, and you're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren sneered, his voice laced with venom. "The Baxter family? Oh, they're strong, all right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they've betrayed the Human Community, sold their souls to Lord Malevolence. The Baxter family's days are numbered! And as for you... you're the reason my comrades in the Pioneers of Starlight are dead! You're the reason our clan nearly got wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, I'll be the one to send you to your grave, avenging my fallen comrades!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Darren's massive hand shot out, wrapping around Orlando's throat and lifting him off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's eyes widened in terror, the icy grip of death already closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! You can't do this! I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Darren wasn't listening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a brutal efficiency, he began to twist and crush Orlando's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though a mid-stage Deity King powerhouse wouldn't die from such a simple move, the sheer terror in Orlando's eyes was unmistakable as he struggled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Darren wasn't about to give him any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands moved with methodical precision, crushing bone after bone in Orlando's body. Then, with a chilling calm, Darren drew the Supreme Malevolence Sword and began to flay Orlando's flesh, piece by agonizing piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando's screams pierced the air, filled with a desperation that begged for a quicker end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he didn't have such immense vitality&mdash;if only he could die faster and escape this living nightmare of torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Darren showed no mercy. His anger burned hotter with every slice of flesh, every bone he shattered. It took what felt like an eternity, but eventually, Orlando's body was reduced to a ghastly white skeleton, every last scrap of flesh stripped away. Only then did the life finally drain from his hollow eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orlando was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the entire estate had fallen into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the people inside had collapsed to the ground, their unconscious forms a testament to Zoe's deadly song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Deity King at the initial stage couldn't withstand Zoe's soul power attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the nine mid-stage Deity Kings managed to hold their ground, barely standing without collapsing, but they were left severely weakened. They were no match for Anastasia, Kendra, and Bryce, who easily dispatched them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's all taken care of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anastasia and the others returned, they couldn't help but frown at the sight of the devastated Orlando.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see if the Radiant Era Syndicate has truly betrayed the Human Community. I need to find out if it was them who nearly wiped out the Pioneers of Starlight a year ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne focused on Orlando's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sealed Orlando's mind and quickly immersed himself in the search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he opened his eyes, a glint of cold determination in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I suspected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radiant Era Syndicate has indeed allied with the Baxter family! But here's the kicker&mdash;they're not directly connected to the Baxter family yet; they don't have that kind of standing. Their real boss is the Falcon Alliance, a top-tier force that answers to the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A year ago, Orlando from the Radiant Era Syndicate was following orders from the Falcon Alliance when he leaked information to the Dark Deity Legion, leading to the near annihilation of the Pioneers of Starlight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, a menacing glint flickered in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
