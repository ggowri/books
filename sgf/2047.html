  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial! We've arrived in deep space. What's next?" Osborne communicated with Primordial, who resided in the Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His decision to venture into deep space wasn't a spontaneous whim. It wasn't merely a gamble, hoping to strike gold while searching for treasures in a vast ocean of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, Primordial had lured him here, insisting that if Osborne wanted to rapidly enhance his cultivation level, deep space was the only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial promised he had a way to ensure Osborne would find something valuable, but he remained coy about the details, insisting they would discuss it once they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's lazy voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, we're here! Head to the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot. We'll need to utilize something there to get to Elf City. Along the way, I'll fill you in on the ins and outs of deep space."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elf City? What's that?" Osborne asked, puzzled yet intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confusion, he followed Primordial's instructions, setting his course toward the lair of the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial continued, "Elf City is the key to what I'm about to explain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During this time, I've absorbed the Tree Heart energy from the Eighth World Tree offshoot, boosting my power significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has also granted me memories of the Eighth World Tree offshoot, enhancing my understanding of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we think of our cosmos as an egg, then deep space serves as the shell that encases it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep space protects our cosmos, isolating it from the Umbra World. Any beings from the Umbra World wanting to enter must first navigate through deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, this is a simplified analogy; the reality is far more complex! What you need to grasp is that deep space acts as a barrier, preventing any contact between our cosmos and the Umbra World. However, due to certain unique circumstances, many materials from the Umbra World seep into deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What may be ordinary in the Umbra World becomes the most coveted treasures for beings in our cosmos!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take the Spatial Gold Crystal, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Umbra World, it might just be worthless shards of glass, but here, it's a powerful ingredient for crafting divine artifacts and can elevate the level of space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apart from Spatial Gold Crystals, there are also Light Gold Crystals, Lightning Gold Crystals, Time Gold Crystals, and many more! If you're lucky enough to find some, boosting your elemental essence will be a breeze, possibly even reaching level ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's just the tip of the iceberg&mdash;there are Apex divine artifacts, Sacred Artifacts, Sacred Elixirs, and so forth. Essentially, everything from the Umbra World is a treasure to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, attentively absorbing Primordial's insights without interruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given the abundance of treasures in deep space, it's no surprise that powerful beings from our cosmos can't resist the temptation to venture in and search for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our cosmos is vast, filled with intelligent life, and countless beings with the strength to break through into deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not an exaggeration to say that there are more than enough of them to fill a library!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theoretically, any being with Deity King-level strength can tear through the fabric of space and enter deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let me tell you, for an average Deity King-level being, stepping into deep space is akin to signing their own death warrant! A single chaotic spatial current could obliterate them without a trace! Moreover, the dangers of deep space are far more diverse than just chaotic spatial currents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To have even a hint of self-preservation while navigating these depths, you need to be a Supernal Deity King at the very least! Yet, even with such power, there are still countless beings in deep space. The reason you haven't encountered any is that this part is exceptionally remote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In reality, deep space has numerous gathering points where life congregates! These spots are relatively safe, and over time, they evolve into bustling cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many super factions have even moved into deep space, establishing sects and families here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, deep space is quite lively, filled with countless powerful beings from across the cosmos coming together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The nearest city to us is known as Elf City. This place originally started as a stronghold for a warrior of the Elf Race, who led his kin in search of treasures within deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Elf Race, known for their love of making friends, often called for gatherings to trade. Before long, more and more beings began to join in, and thus, Elf City was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your goal for this journey is to reach Elf City!" Primordial concluded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was fully taken aback by the idea of cities populating deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that super factions were building influence here blew his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless warriors from the cosmos were congregating in this vast expanse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that deep space could be home to such a place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does this mean that I can actually encounter aliens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Osborne chuckle to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lord Malevolence was essentially an alien; he came from a massive planet known as the Racial Convergence Planet, often called the World of Racial Convergence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was once the ruler of a formidable empire there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having suffered defeat, he was hunted down by his foes, forcing him and his Dark Deity Legion to flee Racial Convergence Planet and find refuge in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara&mdash;more accurately referred to as Celestara Planet&mdash;was certainly less grand than Racial Convergence Planet, which dwarfed it in size and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there were plenty of beings even stronger than Lord Malevolence back on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, planets as powerful as Racial Convergence Planet were quite numerous within the cosmos, if not more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only issue was the vast distances separating them, making it incredibly difficult for any powerful entity to traverse the endless void of space and reach another formidable planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in deep space, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep space might be expansive, but it was not nearly as vast as the entire cosmos. Here, special spatial rules pulled the distances between super planets much closer together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talented beings and warriors from various super planets could converge with far greater ease within deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Maybe I'll encounter warriors from the Racial Convergence Planet in Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Celestara Planet isn't too far from Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Warriors from Racial Convergence Planet entering deep space would likely be near Elf City..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne could barely contain his anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was more than eager to meet other powerful beings from super planets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the idea of it was thrilling!</span></p><div class="pagination">
