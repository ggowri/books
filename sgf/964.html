  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Class S clones surged forward like arrows, relentlessly assaulting the Blood Demon's ranks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the members' impressive coordination and teamwork, each clash exacted a heavy toll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Casualties were unavoidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With every wave, more Blood Demon warriors fell, their lives snuffed out in the chaos of battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne watched in horror as his comrades were cut down, rage boiling within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't just stand here! I need to fight alongside them!" He made to charge into the fray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian grabbed Osborne's arm. "Hold on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In a battle of this scale, individual strength means very little. Even someone like me&mdash;or Gerardo&mdash;would have to retreat when faced with hundreds or thousands of Class AA clones!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's frustration flared, but Sebastian continued, his tone firm yet calm, "You're going to be the new Godfather, and you need to learn to keep your cool! If you want to save them, we can't get surrounded. We have to take out those Class S clones first. Once they're gone, the rest will be much easier to handle. With the strength of the Blood Demon, they can manage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Osborne nodded, forcing himself to focus on the Class S clones wreaking havoc among their ranks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that taking them down wouldn't be impossible, especially with his grandfather by his side. But the real challenge was their position, hidden among the throng of clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Attacking them would likely lead to being overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once surrounded, they would instantly be faced with attacks from hundreds, even thousands of clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Sebastian, in his prime, would suffer injuries in such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned, deep in thought, trying to devise a plan to deal with those dozen Class S clones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Looks like we'll have to resort to assassination," Sebastian said, breaking Osborne's train of thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Assassination?" Osborne's brow furrowed in disbelief. "They're surrounded by their own! How can we possibly get close? Even if we could, the moment we strike, we'd be swarmed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian smirked. "Who says we can't? Leave the getting close part to me. It's about time you saw what your grandpa can really do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift motion, Sebastian raised his hand, and in an instant, he vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened as he realized he could no longer see or sense any energy fluctuations from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My main power is dark power!" Sebastian's voice echoed beside Osborne, startling him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spun around, searching for his grandfather, but even with his Satan's Eye, he couldn't catch a glimpse of Sebastian anywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, that's some serious stealth!" Osborne exclaimed, a mix of awe and admiration filling him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian chuckled. "If I didn't have these skills, how could I have escaped Gerardo's relentless pursuit? How could I have hidden right under his nose for so long?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now's not the time for reminiscing, though. I'll use my dark power to cloak you, allowing us to sneak up on those Class S clones. But remember, once we strike, we'll be exposed. We'll only get one shot at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make it a point to eliminate as many S-class clones as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, determination etched on his face. "Let's make it count!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian grinned. "Great! How about we have a little competition? Let's see who can take down more Class S clones. Sure, you're still at Class AAA, but I believe you've got what it takes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's spirits lifted at the challenge, a smile breaking through his earlier tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright then! Let's see who can take down more Class S clones. I'll take the left side, and you handle the right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sounds like a plan!" Sebastian replied with a grin, waving his hand to envelop Osborne's body in darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, they shot off, merging into the shadows as they raced toward their targets&mdash;the Class S clones wedged within the frenzied crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sixteen Class S clones were currently at the forefront, leading a charge against the members of the Blood Demon. They shouted battle cries, completely oblivious to the danger that was creeping in on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Push forward! Wipe them out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They can't hold on much longer! For the great King of the Aberrants, finish them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once we exterminate these pests, the Augustine family and the Draco Group won't stand a chance against us Aberrants! The city of Rosmandi will fall to our might!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go! Go! Go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Class S clones surged forward in two sharp formations, flanked by hundreds of regular clones, ready to launch a new wave of attack on the Blood Demon members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their confidence was practically bursting at the seams&mdash;until Osborne and Sebastian slipped into the shadows beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eight Class S clones together over there," Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne melded perfectly with the chaos, undetected among the clones. He surveyed their movements, calculating his next move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Taking them all out at once seems impossible. I have only this one shot&mdash;I have to make it count or the tide won't turn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne steeled himself, determination coursing through his veins. "I guess it's now or never..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought echoing in his mind, he sprang into action.</p><div class="pagination">
