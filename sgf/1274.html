  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eamon's furious hand descended, intent on crushing Sebastian, a shadow darted from the towering heights of Mount Celestial Reach like a bolt of black and gold lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of this shadow was astonishing; in the blink of an eye, it was upon Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's expression shifted dramatically, but before he could react, the shadow struck him with a force that sent him flying across the battlefield, a muffled grunt escaping his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon struggled to halt his momentum, hovering awkwardly in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood began to seep from the corner of his mouth as he stared, wide-eyed, at the source of the black and gold lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadow, having knocked Eamon back, settled onto Sebastian's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes widened in shock and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow?! Is it really you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perched on Sebastian's shoulder was a sleek, black-and-gold cat, its fur devoid of any other colors. Upon hearing Sebastian's voice, it blinked playfully before it turned to face Eamon, cold fury igniting within its eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Divine Shadow sprang into action, transforming back into a streak of lightning, racing toward Eamon once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its claws unsheathed, the cat unleashed a flurry of strikes that seemed capable of rending the very sky. Eamon's face paled as he felt the immense pressure of Divine Shadow's assault. He unleashed his divine power, desperately trying to defend against the onslaught, but the claws sliced through his defenses, leaving a deep, agonizing gash across his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Divine Shadow wasn't done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its speed and agility were unmatched, and its divine power rivaled Eamon's own, perhaps even surpassing it, reaching the pinnacle of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each strike pierced through Eamon's defenses, and soon, he was drenched in blood, his anguished cries echoing through the air as he tried to evade the relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectacle left everyone present in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! How can Divine Shadow be this powerful? Eamon, a Transcendent Deity, is being toyed with like a mere plaything?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many from the Augustine family recognized Divine Shadow but knew little of its origins. They only understood that it was Sebastian's pet&mdash;a constant companion wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had never imagined that this seemingly ordinary cat could possess such overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no pet; this was a harbinger of death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, too, was taken aback. Just when he thought he was facing imminent death at Eamon's hands, Divine Shadow had swooped in to save him, now unleashing its </span><span>wrath upon Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always known Divine Shadow was extraordinary, having been around long before the Augustine family had settled in their current location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian never anticipated it would be this powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow..." Sebastian murmured, his eyes shining with renewed hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he had resigned himself to a fight to the death, Divine Shadow's appearance reignited a spark of possibility in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Divine Shadow is this strong, maybe we stand a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cedric Deschanel, get over here and help me! This damn cat is too strong&mdash;I can't hold it off!" Eamon's voice rang out in a desperate roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the two Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity warriors holding off God of Star remained engaged, while the other raced toward Eamon to lend assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression hardened, determination flooding his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow, I'm coming to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fierce resolve, Sebastian launched himself into the fray, intent on blocking Cedric's advance and supporting Divine Shadow in its relentless assault. Unfortunately for him, he was just a Junior Deity. Even with a Level Five Divine Body and wielding the Godfather's scepter&mdash;capable of unleashing power rivaling that of a Superior Deity&mdash;he still couldn't hold back Cedric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Cedric shattered his assault and closed the gap to Eamon's side, launching an offensive alongside his ally against Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Divine Shadow remained unfazed, taking on both of them without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, three Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan faced off against the God of Star and Divine Shadow from the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five of these Transcendent-Deity-level beings engaged in a cataclysmic battle, their divine powers clashing and sending shockwaves through the air, stirring up winds that could rival a hurricane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like the apocalypse was upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and the others watched with bated breath as the battle unfolded. They understood that the fate of the Augustine family hinged on whether Divine Shadow and God of Star could overpower the three Transcendent Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what they could see, both God of Star and Divine Shadow seemed to have the upper hand in this fierce clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled within the Augustine family members as they witnessed their champions holding their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Eamon, the situation was unacceptable. Here he was, teaming up with Cedric, yet struggling to contend with this mysterious cat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! What in the hell is that damned cat? Where did it come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it helping the Augustine family? They've got way too many secrets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon seethed, directing his fury at his followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All members of the Deschanel Clan, listen up! Attack! I want every last one of the </span><span>Augustine family wiped out! If that cat thinks it can save them, then I'll make it my mission to obliterate the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, the twelve Superior Deities surrounding the Augustine Estate finally sprang into action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
