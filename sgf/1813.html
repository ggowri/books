  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne made the decision to unleash his full power without holding back, the outcome of this battle became a foregone conclusion&mdash;there was no longer any hint of suspense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Hubery stood at the peak of the Deity King, and nearly twenty other late-stage Deity Kings were by his side, even the combined might of over five hundred Deity Kings on their side paled in comparison to Osborne's overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne, who had reached the pinnacle of the Deity King level, stood firm against them, flanked by sixty-four Spatial Clones that mirrored half of his battle strength and an army of one million Dark Undeads, each at the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they were more than sufficient to crush anyone standing in Osborne's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt confident that even an army of Dark Deity Legion couldn't withstand his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire region of Celestara, the number of those who could hope to escape his wrath was minimal&mdash;and Hubery and his allies certainly weren't among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the members of the Blood Demon faction found themselves as mere spectators, their involvement rendered unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, he conjured countless Abyssal Spears&mdash;massive weapons stretching over a hundred yards long, as dark as coal, capable of swallowing even sunlight. They radiated a terrifying energy that sent shivers down the spines of those who beheld them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's command rang out, devoid of any hesitation, as hundreds of these Abyssal Spears hurled themselves toward Hubery and his five hundred comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defend yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair etched across their faces, but Hubery and the others refused to resign themselves to defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they unleashed their divine power in desperate roars, attempting to obstruct Osborne's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their efforts were futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Spear stands as Osborne's ultimate attack, a weapon of devastating power. Its piercing force was unparalleled, slicing through any defense like paper, mercilessly impaling its target before detonating with explosive fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current prowess behind each spear, only Hubery, standing at the pinnacle of the Deity King realm, could offer a slight resistance; the rest didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members from numerous clans, including the mighty Paramount Supreme Clan, fell prey to Osborne's Abyssal Spears, which pierced their bodies and exploded, showering the battlefield with gruesome remnants of what once had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled beneath the weight of destruction, and amidst the chaos, Osborne stood resolute, an emblem of sheer, unrelenting power as he swept away those challengers in a brutal display of might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would be no survivors this day, and the tide had irrevocably turned in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams of terror echoed around the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, over a hundred Deity Kings had fallen to Osborne's Abyssal Spears. The remaining warriors, quick to react, banded together in a last-ditch effort to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Impressive reflexes! Too bad it won't save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, waving his hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having tested his own strength, he decided not to engage any further in a direct fight. Instead, he commanded his Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, sixty-four Spatial Clones and a million Dark Undeads surged forward like a relentless tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of their assault overwhelmed the remaining Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they teamed up, their resistance was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrieks grew louder&mdash;a chilling symphony of despair filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hear cries for mercy mingling with the sounds of slaughter, but most pleas were cut short as the Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads swiftly eradicated the survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within mere moments, the battlefield fell silent. Most of the Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads hadn't even had a chance to engage before every enemy had been dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Hubery remained, still clinging to life, lying on the ground with his Divine Body shattered, his eyes reflecting deep despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his hand, and the Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads halted their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode confidently toward Hubery, a predator approaching its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, and several others appeared at Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger blazed in their eyes as they fixated on the fallen Hubery, who had dealt them grave wounds not too long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, even in her Supreme Sovereign's Armor, had almost been killed by Hubery's earlier attack&mdash;a near-miss that still haunted her. Had Osborne not been available to heal Bryce and intervene, Zoe might not have survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Face to face with Hubery, Zoe was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to kill him myself!" she said, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I spared his life just so you could be the one to finish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's determination solidified as she clenched her Supreme Malevolence Sword, stepping closer to Hubery, who sensed the murderous intent radiating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an elder of the Eldridge family! If you kill me, they won't let you off the hook! The esteemed Lord Malevolence won't forgive you!" Hubery gasped, desperation clawing at his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe laughed coldly. "Is it a bit late to be begging for mercy? You were so full of yourself earlier, plotting to wipe us out. If Osborne hadn't been busy, you wouldn't have had a chance to bully me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she raised her sword, and in a swift motion, she brought it down.</span></p><div class="pagination">
