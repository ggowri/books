  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt increasingly uneasy and thought, "Why is this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence getting stronger and stronger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he possessed both spatial power and time powers, in such a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, he still felt a bit dizzy and had no idea where it was taking them. When Osborne realized they couldn't go on like this and had to leave the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, he was shocked to discover they couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Chrono-Spatial Turbulence generated immense power, trapping the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Even with the Sacred Crystal in the energy core burning wildly, they still couldn't escape the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried to do something, but it was completely useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence here, his spatial power and time powers seemed very weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're in trouble this time. Primordial." Osborne called out to Primordial without hesitation and explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial became serious. "You're too reckless. Relying on your spatial power and time powers to use the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence to escape. The Chrono-Spatial Turbulence in deep space isn't something you can enter casually. And yet, without understanding the situation, you stayed inside. You're practically courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial speechlessly. "What's the point of saying this now? Just tell me what's going on. How can we get out of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't leave," Primordial said without hesitation. "You should be in the most turbulent area of this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. In such a place, even a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness would be in danger. If it weren't for your spatial power, time powers, and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, you would have likely been torn apart by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can only think of a way to leave after passing through this turbulent area. You'd better pray not to be taken to a dangerous zone by this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Otherwise, even I might be doomed because of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one knows where this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence leads. Perhaps, by the time we leave the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, we might have already left deep space and entered the Umbra World."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne immediately became serious, thinking, "Umbra World? Wouldn't that mean we've left the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't want that to happen. After all, the cosmos was his home. Everyone he cared about lived here. He hadn't yet paid respects to his mother from his past life, avenged himself, or found his parents in this life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had so much to do. Besides, Osborne knew nothing about the Umbra World. He had no desire to go to the Umbra World at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, there was nothing he could do but silently hope not to be taken too far by the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence and to pass through this turbulent area as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from waiting, Osborne could do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, though rapid, wasn't particularly chaotic, so it wasn't very dangerous. If they were in an extremely chaotic Chrono-Spatial Turbulence under such intense conditions, they would have been torn apart long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, even Osborne, who mastered time powers, could no longer accurately gauge the passage of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I really hope I won't miss the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Agatha recovered from her injuries and opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared in surprise at the colorful lights swiftly flashing past outside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha asked, "Osborne, are we still in the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence? Why is this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence so fast?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne gave a wry smile. Knowing he couldn't hide </span><span>it,</span><span> he had no choice but to explain the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's expression immediately turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "We're trapped in the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence and can't escape? Are we just drifting along?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the terrifying power of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, Agatha felt a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Did I just escape one danger only to fall into another?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. We should be safe. However, we might be taken to a completely unfamiliar place. I just hope we won't end up too far from the Racial Convergence Planet. Otherwise, getting back will be really difficult," Osborne reassured Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha nodded and said apologetically, "I'm sorry. I dragged you into this. If it weren't for saving me, you wouldn't be facing these dangers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "What are you talking about? This was my own choice. Besides, this might not be a bad thing. This Chrono-Spatial Turbulence could take us to a place full of treasures, right? After all, in deep space, anything is possible. If we manage to get some treasures from the Umbra World, we'll hit the jackpot."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing Osborne was comforting her, Agatha couldn't help but feel touched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "But how could the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence possibly take us to a place full of treasures? That's absolutely impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My luck has always been great. So just relax and wait," Osborne said, then looked outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that the speed of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence seemed to slow down a bit. Ordinary people might not notice it, but with his spatial power and time powers, he sensed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne a bit excited and also somewhat cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence passed through the most turbulent area, they could leave. But no one knew what was outside the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Chrono-Spatial Turbulence might take them to a place full of treasures, or it might lead them to a place filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It all depends on their luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chrono-Spatial Turbulence has slowed down." At this moment, Agatha also noticed the slowdown of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence and became a bit excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "You need to be ready. We'll be leaving the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spread her Dark Phoenix Wings, then let the twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields spin around her and Osborne. Immediately, she gripped the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, ready for battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also summoned the Eclipse War Armor and gripped the Bloodwrought Bow. He even formed three Sacred Power Arrows infused with the Divine Ascendance Technique on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's now." Feeling the sudden slowdown of the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, Osborne controlled the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to rush out swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if breaking through the water's surface, Osborne felt everything around him become clear. But when he saw his surroundings, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha beside him was also stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had unexpectedly arrived in a primal jungle, surrounded by towering trees that nearly blocked out the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These trees were unique. Each leaf resembled a small, intricately designed boat. There were also some fruits on the trees, and those fruits were even more extraordinary, as each one looked like a massive warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne asked in confusion. He didn't sense any danger but kept a firm grip on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha shook her head, also unsure what it was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial appeared on his own. He looked at the massive, peculiar trees, the boat-like leaves, and the warship-like fruits, his eyes filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "This is the Warfare Ancient Tree, a great thing. Where did the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence take you? You actually encountered so many Warfare Ancient Trees."</span></p><div class="pagination">
