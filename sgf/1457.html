  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana said, "And here at our slave market, we just happen to offer black market exchange services. One mid-grade Essence Crystal can get you one hundred and twenty low-grade Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pulled out over a hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals from the pouch and handed them back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, for the 80 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals to deregister those slaves, you'll actually only need to pay less than seven hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, impressed. "I see. Well, thank you for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, he pocketed the mid-grade Essence Crystals with a casual air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! It's time for the auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded, feeling a newfound respect for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had easily settled the hefty fee for deregistering the slaves with mid-grade Essence Crystals, which made her reconsider her initial impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Maybe he really can pull off spending ten million Essence Crystals. It sounds a bit far-fetched, but who knows? Better not to offend him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she turned to the guards, she commanded, "Lock those two up for now and wait for my investigation! If it turns out they did indeed mess with our guest, they won't be getting off easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then flashed a smile at Osborne. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, right this way! Today's auction will be held in the largest hall, and I can guarantee you the finest items!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, falling into step beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back at the Swift Manor, news of Osborne's outburst at the slave market had reached Calvin and Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the air was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's face turned crimson with rage. "What? That idiot! How dare he!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is, causing a scene at the slave market?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't he realize that behind the slave market stands the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Lachlan trying to bring ruin upon the Swift family? If he angers the slave market, neither the Demonic Dragon Clan nor the Soaring Lion Clan will let us off the hook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Lachlan marries into the Gellar family of the Mystic Feather Clan yet, if he stirs up trouble at the slave market, he's signing his own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's expression was equally grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers drummed lightly on the table, sending faint ripples of divine power into the air, betraying his inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's "Dad, we need to make a decision, and fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest we issue a statement severing ties with that fool before the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan decide to take their anger out on us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we act quickly, we might only lose him and avoid their wrath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's voice was icy and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter frowned, weighing the implications. "Cutting ties with Lachlan? Kicking him out of the Swift family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is still my grandson. Besides, we don't have all the details yet. Announcing a break now could be premature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're counting on him to marry into the Gellar family and strengthen our ties with the Mystic Feather Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin scoffed, an icy smile creeping onto his face. "Dad, we can't hesitate any longer! The fact is that Lachlan caused a scene at the slave market. Do you really think he has a bright future ahead of him? Even if we wanted to bail him out, it would come at a steep price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you honestly think Lachlan is worth that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for the Swift family relying on his marriage to Hannah Gellar from the Mystic Feather Clan, that's a pipe dream! It may seem promising, but in reality, it's a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We know what type of person Lachlan is. Do you really believe he's good enough for Hannah from the Gellar family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's expression darkened further as he listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin continued, "We can't keep dragging our feet, dad! If we wait until the slave market retaliates against the Swift family because of that fool, it will be too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we did try to rescue him, it would likely provoke both clans. It's far better to cut him loose now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Calvin's urgent plea, Walter sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. If that's how you see it, then let's go ahead with your plan. After all, once my birthday banquet wraps up in three days, I'll publicly announce that you will be taking over as the new head of the Swift family. This decision is yours to make."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Walter couldn't help but picture Lachlan in his mind and shook his head in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a disappointment he's turned out to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Walter vanished, leaving Calvin smirking to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you thought you could stand against me? Let's see how you manage now! The Swift family will not come to your aid! You're on your own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, summoning one of his aides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go out and issue a statement in the name of the Swift family. Declare that Lachlan is a reckless scoundrel, disregarding his elders. From now on, he's disowned and expelled from the Swift family. Whatever he does from this moment forward is no longer our concern. Get it done immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
