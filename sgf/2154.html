  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the chaos of war, the border battlefield was drenched in blood, with the gruesome conflict raging on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion vastly outnumbered the Human Alliance, boasting nearly five times their ranks. After an intense initial clash, the Human Community found themselves increasingly on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally regaining her composure, the God of Light ordered a retreat, directing the Human Alliance to fall back to Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By leveraging the city's geographical advantages and robust defenses, they hoped to withstand the relentless assault of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Dark Deity Legion wasn't about to let the Human Community retreat unopposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They launched a fierce offensive, aiming for maximum victories before the human forces could regroup within the safety of Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost for the Human Alliance was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they were not far from their destination and eventually managed to reach Peaks City, where its formidable defenses finally halted the Dark Deity Legion's advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What ensued was a grueling war of attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Peaks City as their stronghold, the Human Community struggled against the onslaught. The Dark Deity Legion was relentless, aiming to breach the city's walls, knowing that capturing it would spell disaster for the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance, aware that a retreat was not an option, stood firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Peaks City, they would be crushed under the weight of the Dark Deity Legion's five-to-one odds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every second brought new casualties, with countless warriors from the ranks of Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, and even Deity Kings falling in battle. The bloodshed exceeded everyone's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet deep down, they all understood that the true outcome of this war hinged not on the vast numbers&mdash;the 50 billion of the Dark Deity Legion versus the 10 billion of the Human Alliance&mdash;but rather on the elite Supernal Deity Kings on both sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the God of Light represented the Human Community, while the Paramount Supreme Clan was backed by powerful figures like Icy One, Icy Two, and other Dark Sovereigns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their clash would ultimately determine the fate of the Human Community against the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the God of Light were defeated, Icy One and the others would easily dismantle the defenses of Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conversely, should Icy One fall, the God of Light, alongside her immense army, would stand firm against even the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High above, the atmosphere vibrated as the God of Light clashed fiercely with Icy One, Icy Two, and the other three Dark Sovereigns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One roared, brandishing the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, "God of Light, stop struggling! </span><span>There is</span><span> no hope</span><span> left for y</span><span>our Human Community! This time, the esteemed Lord Malevolence is dead set on annihilating the Human Community in the West Zone and rebuilding his Malevolence Empire on Celestara Planet. You humans, attempting to be an obstacle to his ambitions, will only be crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light retaliated, maneuvering the Sanctum of Light to counter the relentless assault. She scoffed, saying, "Malevolence Empire? That's a laugh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your so-called empire was obliterated on Racial Convergence Planet! If you've got the guts, go back to Racial Convergence Planet to try and rebuild your empire! Think you can resurrect it here on Celestara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't succeed because I won't allow it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With unwavering resolve, the God of Light fought valiantly, capable of holding her ground against Icy One and his fellows. But the presence of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower was a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its defensive capabilities were monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her incredible power and the strength of the Sanctum of Light, she knew she couldn't breach the defenses of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grim reality was that as long as the Paramount Supreme Clan had access to Celestial Crystals, the tower's defenses could be replenished and restored with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the God of Light's resources were limited when it came to Celestial Crystals. If their battle fell into a grind, she knew in her heart that she didn't have the upper hand. Eventually, she could very well be overwhelmed by Icy One and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One, fully aware of the battlefield's dynamics, wore a smug grin despite being temporarily on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, does it really matter if you disagree? You can't stop us, and you certainly can't stop the esteemed Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion! And let's not forget, the esteemed Lord Malevolence hasn't even entered the fray yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he decides to step in, taking you down would be a walk in the park. But you know what? His real opponent is the God of Night, and he wouldn't waste his time on you...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better recognize your place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the Human Community in the West Zone has two choices&mdash;either submit completely and become vassals, slaves to the Paramount Supreme Clan, or face total annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Malevolence Empire will be rebuilt on Celestara Planet, and that's something you can't prevent. Not even the God of Night can stop it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression darkened at his words. "You're living in a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night will thwart your plans! Celestara Planet belongs to the Human Community, not to the Paramount Supreme Clan or Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You invaders deserve to be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the God of Light unleashed a flurry of attacks, but they were futile. The Ninefold Heaven's Tower absorbed every blow, its defenses impenetrable even for someone of her caliber, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One taunted, a smirk on his face, "Stop wasting your energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just look at the situation below! Even with the advantage of Peaks City, your Human Alliance is no match for the Dark Deity Legion! They're dying, bleeding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really bear to see them all perish? If you lead them to surrender, they could live..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light retorted, her voice icy, "Shut your mouth! The Human Community will never be enslaved! You can forget about me leading them to surrender; that'll never happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Icy One's face darkened. "You're truly foolish, God of Light! If you're looking for death, don't say we didn't warn you! Once we take you down, the Human Alliance will collapse like a house of cards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed ferocity, Icy One and his comrades ramped up their assault, and the battle grew even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they were all too familiar with each other's tactics, and without any significant changes in strategy, neither side could gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two suddenly sent a message to Icy One. "This woman is a real headache! We shouldn't waste any more time with her. Let's pull out the big guns and take her down for good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Alliance, even with Peaks City's advantages, is causing us considerable losses. While we still hold the upper hand, breaking through Peaks City under these conditions would cost us a billion Dark Deity Legion warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Lord Malevolence finds out about such massive losses, even if we end up conquering the West Zone, we might not only gain nothing but also incur his wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression soured at this, revealing a flicker of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two pressed on, his tone persuasive. "Stop hesitating! We need to unleash our ultimate moves! If we can just injure the God of Light, we'll have the breathing room to take Peaks City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Peaks City falls, the Human Community is done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire West Zone will be ours for the taking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, we might suffer some losses, but it'll all be worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One clenched his teeth, nodding firmly. "You're right! Let's not waste any more time! It's time to unleash our ultimate techniques!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, we take down the God of Light!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
