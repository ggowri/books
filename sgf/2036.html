  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!" Icy Six's face turned ghostly pale as he felt his divine power defenses rapidly erod</span><span>ed</span><span>. Panic surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence had always stemmed from his impenetrable defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six believed that while Osborne was undeniably powerful, Osborne lacked the strength to pierce through his barriers completely, allowing him to hold out for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne's divine power arrow exploded, it clung to Icy Six's defenses, unleashing a terrifying corrosive force that began to eat away at his protective layers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the attack was astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corrosive effect of the Bloodstrike Orb energy was notorious for overwhelming even beings as formidable as the Eight World Tree offshoot and Creation Herald. The two wield the strength of an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Not only did it corrode their divine power defenses, but it also nearly dissolved their very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's divine power, while not nearly as potent as the Bloodstrike Orb, was still more than sufficient to deal with Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific corrosive effect tore a massive hole in Icy Six's divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, over a hundred Spatial Clones seized the opportunity, unleashing a barrage of Dimensional Razors through the breach, striking at Icy Six's Divine Body and leaving gruesome gashes in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream erupted from Icy Six as he transformed into a bloody mess in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Explode!" he roared, unleashing a surge of divine power that manifested a second layer of defense, sending Osborne's residual divine power flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like it worked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement as he witnessed the devastating effect of his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Icy Six, being an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, quickly concocted a countermeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how long you can hold out!" he taunted, drawing back the Bloodwrought Bow once more, a blood-red arrow materializing in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift release of the string, the arrow shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it could even hit Icy Six, Osborne was already nocking another arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A relentless stream of blood-red arrows flew toward Icy Six, not giving him a moment to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows struck Icy Six's divine power defenses, quickly adhering to them and beginning </span><span>to corrode</span><span>. Before long, Icy Six was enveloped in a swirling mass of Crimson Energy, resembling a blood-soaked sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, the divine power merely corroded his defenses, but soon it seeped into Icy Six's Divine Body, voraciously eating away at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another anguished cry echoed as Icy Six desperately unleashed his power, trying to dispel the terrifying divine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was futile. Osborne's divine power was like a relentless parasite, locking onto his essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't rid himself of it without exhausting every last bit of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to draw his bow, releasing arrow after arrow, the blood-red energy swirling around Icy Six growing denser by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, Icy Six's divine power defenses had completely crumbled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred Spatial Clones sprang into action simultaneously. This time, instead of the blood-red divine power arrows, Osborne locked a transparent spatial arrow onto his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of sheer power, spatial arrows far surpassed divine power arrows, and with Icy Six's defenses shattered, it was the perfect moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, the moment my arrow flies, despair will take hold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, you're drowning in it. Welcome to hell! Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was icy as he released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial arrow shot forward, reaching Icy Six in the blink of an eye, slamming into his defenseless Divine Body with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow unleashed a terrifying explosion within Icy Six, piercing through his form and tearing apart flesh and bone, obliterating his very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding space collapsed violently, reducing Icy Six's insides to a mere shadow of their former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at his chest, watching as his organs crumbled into nothingness. Life surged out of him like a dam breaking, and a look of utter disbelief and despair washed over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Am I... dying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns under Lord Malevolence, ranked sixth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've led the Dark Deity Legion against the Human Alliance on the border battlefield of the West Zone for nearly a century. I've even faced the God of Light multiple times and managed to escape each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now... we, the Eight Dark Sovereigns, came together just to take down a few young Human Community brats, thinking it would be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet... I'm going to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Supernal Deity King at Ascension Six, falling to a mere Human Community brat who is only at Ascension Two or even One?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't I be able to crush such a being with a flick of my wrist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This can't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I refuse to accept this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was merciless. Icy Six felt the last remnants of his life force slipping away, the spatial energy from Osborne still tearing at his Divine Body, the divine power corroding everything it touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled his eyes as he realized his Divine Body was beyond saving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Goddess of Life were alive, there would be no hope for him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great effort, he lifted his head to face Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... you won't get away with this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed Lord Malevolence will avenge me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire Human Community will pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six's voice roared with fury, but his Divine Body continued to dissolve rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, watching as the combined might of his Spatial Clones engulfed and shredded Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a violent wave of spatial fluctuation, Icy Six's Divine Body was utterly obliterated from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blurred shadow shot out from the remnants of Icy Six's shattered Divine Body, desperately trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his soul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his Divine Body had collapsed, his soul still clung to life, seeking refuge in the cycle of reincarnation or hoping to seize another</span><span> person</span><span>'s Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was ready for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snap of his fingers, a soul attack erupted. Icy Six's fleeing soul hadn't gotten far before it ignited in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a silent scream, it was reduced to nothingness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six was dead&mdash;truly dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the highest leaders of the Dark Deity Legion, he had been slain by Osborne in a one-on-one battle, not even given a chance to reincarnate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!" Osborne exhaled deeply, a weight lifted from his shoulders as he turned his gaze toward the battlefield where Anastasia and the others were fighting.</span></p><div class="pagination">
