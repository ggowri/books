  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are the names of my parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was ridiculous that Osborne still didn't know his parents' names until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the Godfather sighed, "Your father's name is Theodore Augustine, and he is my only son. Your mother's name is Vivienne Augustine. She is a good woman, and Theodore is lucky to marry her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, remembering these two names firmly because these were the names of his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and continued, "How did they disappear? You've been investigating for so many years, so do you have any clues?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather sighed and closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed reluctant to recall those painful memories. At this moment, The Godfather appeared to be like an ordinary old man. Only by closing his eyes could he prevent the tears from rolling down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he finally said, "The disappearance of your parents is all my fault! I only have Theodore as my son, so I have high expectations for him and regard him as my only heir. But not everyone can take my position. If his abilities are not enough, taking my place will only make him meet his demise more quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore is very exceptional, and he is also confident. He effortlessly completed the test tasks I assigned to him every time, so I started feeling proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I assigned Theodore even more dangerous tasks, asking him to investigate the </span><span>situation of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. He agreed without any hesitation. At that time, neither he nor I knew that Vivienne was already pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, your parents gave birth to you quietly in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. But at the same time, they were also targeted. I only got the news that Vivienne gave birth to you, and before I could rush over, they got into trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I rushed to </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and saw only a destroyed hospital...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your parents and you are gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been searching for you for over 20 years but I can't find you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather said this, and his fingers trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly felt a little pity for the Godfather. Although he held a high position, his only son, Theodore, was missing, and the Godfather had been searching for him for more than 20 years without success. This kind of pain was definitely very torturous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you find any clues?" Osborne gritted his teeth and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather nodded. "I did find some clues. At that time, Theodore's strength was already Class AA, and Vivienne was even stronger than him, having reached Class AAA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised as he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne was actually stronger than Theodore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be surprised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled, "She is one of the most talented people I have ever met. Vivienne reached Class AAA at the age of 20! In the year she disappeared, she was only 22 years old and was already striving for Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have lived for 80 years and have seen countless geniuses. However, I have only seen one person who is more talented than Vivienne, and she may not even be considered a human being."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. Vivienne was already Class AAA at the age of 20. At the age of 22, she was already striving for Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of genius was she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, among the people the Godfather had met, was there anyone more genius than Vivienne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is that person?" Osborne was extremely curious at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled but did not answer, "You will know who it is soon. Let's get back to business. Although I haven't found your parents in the past 20 years, I have found some clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your parents were very powerful. Only the Class S Supreme Overlord could defeat them! And during the time they went missing, there were only three Class S Supreme Overlords who appeared near </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was a Class S Supreme Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, his parents were most likely abducted by the Class S Supreme Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Godfather refused to tell him the truth before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Osborne was indeed much weaker and had no understanding of what the Class S Supreme Overlord was. He couldn't even come into contact with beings of that level. But what difference did it make for him to know now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne went looking for them rashly, he would just be seeking death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was still not qualified to fight against the Class S Supreme Overlord, but at least he could investigate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three Class S Supreme Overlords? Who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, and his eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather also clenched his fist and said, "They are, respectively, the leader of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>; the number one killer of the world's number one assassin organization, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, Emperor Dare; and the deputy leader of the League of Divine Descent, the head of the Hastings family, Reginald Hastings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying this, the Godfather was full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, do you know why I haven't found your parents in more than 20 years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because the three people, I suspect, are not only extremely powerful, not weaker than me at all, but the forces behind them are equally terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, or the League of Divine Descent, their strength is not weaker than Draco Group, and they are even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is only the weakest among them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather was in great anguish because his power was insufficient to rescue Theodore and Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emperor Dare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reginald Hastings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His parents were abducted by one of those three Class S Supreme Overlords, who were leaders or important figures of three different superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should Osborne find his parents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he couldn't help but feel a little desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, his eyes became firm and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember their names!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter which one of those three individuals abducted my parents, I will investigate it and rescue them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how powerful they are, I will definitely do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this firmly, Osborne suddenly felt the energy around him begin to surge wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he showed surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, Osborne broke through to Class AA at this time!</span></p><div class="pagination">
