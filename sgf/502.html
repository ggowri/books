  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of </span><span>Augustines</span><span>, led by Isaac, surrounded the Walker Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker family was instantly alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless members of the Walker family emerged, glaring at the Augustine forces with rage. The fact that the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> dared to surround their estate enraged them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, there were nine ancient families in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Walker family was undoubtedly one of the strongest, comparable only to the Paltrow family and the Luther family. As for the Augustine family, they had never </span><span>even considered them a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the Augustine family had the audacity to surround them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was sheer madness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Walker family were thinking the same thing&mdash;that the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> had lost their minds. They were certain that as soon as the Walker family's elders arrived, the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> would immediately beg for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as time passed and no Walker family elders appeared, unease began to spread among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secret operation by the four ancient families to eliminate Osborne was highly classified. The Walker family warriors had never imagined it could fail, so they hadn't informed anyone else in the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't know was that their elders would never appear again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all dead, killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac stepped forward, his cold gaze sweeping over the Walker family members before he finally spoke, "Hear me, Walker family. Your patriarch, Shawn Walker, your elders, and all your warriors, who conspired with the Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne families to kill our heir Osborne, are all dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared, "Now, on behalf of the Augustine family, I am declaring war on the Walker family! All members of the Walker family, surrender immediately! If you try to run, you'll die! If you try to resist, you'll die! If you refuse to submit, you'll die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Isaac finished speaking, the hundreds of </span><span>Augustines</span><span> behind him roared in unison, "Surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bloodthirsty cries struck fear into the hearts of the Walker family. Their faces turned pale, and their eyes widened with terror as they stared at Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their patriarch, Shawn, was dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their elders and all their warriors were dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to believe it. Some began frantically trying to contact the elders, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can make the Walker family surrender? You think we'll submit to you? Never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice rang out from among the Walker family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Walker family members, listen to me! Attack! Fight the </span><span>Augustines</span><span> with everything you've got! Fight your way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words were spoken, several Walker family members moved, attempting to break through the Augustine forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac watched, a cold smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! A few </span><span>Class</span><span> B+ fighters think they can break through? Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac extended his hand, and in an instant, a terrifying flame engulfed the charging Walker family members, reducing them to ashes amidst their screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dealing with mere Class B+ fighters was child's play to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll say it one more time. Surrender immediately. If you try to run, you'll die! If you </span><span>try to resist, you'll die! If you refuse to submit, you'll die!" he warned, effortlessly killing several Walkers as if it were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isaac's display of power and his deadly warning, no one dared to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll submit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the immense pressure broke some of the Walker family members, and they began to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once the first few surrendered, the resistance crumbled like an avalanche. In an instant, the idea of fighting back vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resist?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the top fighters of the Walker family were gone, likely killed. The strongest among them were only Class B+, no match for Isaac, a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resistance would only lead to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrendering and submitting, while humiliating, was the only way to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the entire Walker family surrendered, falling under the control of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next was the Marion family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of Augustine elders, leading a team of skilled fighters, surrounded the Marion Estate. The resistance they faced was stronger than what the Walker family had put up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, after several of the Augustine elders&mdash;Class A- fighters&mdash;quickly killed a dozen or so of the Marion family's Class B+ warriors, the Marion family, too, chose to surrender and submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came the Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then the Hawthorne family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one day, the four ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>&mdash;the Walker, Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne families&mdash;all surrendered to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Paltrow family having already submitted, five of </span><span>Dampston's</span><span> nine ancient families were now under the Augustine family's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that the Augustine family had suddenly become the most powerful ancient family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>&mdash;without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the remaining three ancient families received the news, they were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that </span><span>Dampston</span><span> had finally seen the rise of a dominant power&mdash;a hegemon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that power was the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they, too, were ancient families, they were now no longer on equal footing with the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>. In fact, they had to worry about whether the Augustine family might wipe them out as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne stood in the highest tower of Augustine Estate, listening to the reports coming in from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top fighters of the four ancient families had all been killed by him, so he hadn't </span><span>participated in the final operations, leaving it to Isaac, Brian, and the others to lead the assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the sieges were finally complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four ancient families were now vassals of the Augustine family, and a significant portion of the wealth they had accumulated over centuries now belonged to the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a long breath, a smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, it's done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Godfather's fifth trial is finally, completely done! That was tough! But it's over now. I wonder what the reward will be. And what will my sixth trial be?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
