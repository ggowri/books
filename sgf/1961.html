  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the West Zone's Sanctum of Light, the breathtakingly beautiful God of Light stood by the window, gazing out at the landscape with a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep sigh escaped her lips as she murmured, "God of Night, where on earth are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't return soon, we won't be able to hold the West Zone! The last refuge of the Human Community is about to be overrun by the Dark Deity Legion..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, determination flickering in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't you worry, I'll do everything in my power to protect it, even if it costs me my life! God of Death, God of Life, God of Space, God of Time, and God of Destiny have all faced death before. Perhaps it's my turn now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, her brow furrowed again, calling out, "Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a shadowy figure materialized behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light, how may I serve you?" the figure inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any updates from the Sanctum of Night?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure shook its head. "No new developments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time is still stuck outside the Sanctum of Night, but Isa and her group have ignored her completely, not even granting her entry. God of Time is furious, but she can't breach the Sanctum of Night's defenses and is left waiting outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light sighed heavily, "What a mess! God of Night, if you don't return soon, it won't just be the West Zone in trouble. Your Sanctum of Night will be in jeopardy too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning serious, she added, "Keep a close watch on the situation at the Sanctum of Night! If God of Time and Isa end up clashing, I want to know immediately! No matter what, God of Time died for him once before. We can't let her come to harm! At the very least, she must not die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure's expression shifted, concern evident. "The esteemed God of Light, are you suggesting that God of Time might struggle against Ms. Bowin? That shouldn't be the case. Her strength is nearly fully restored!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light let out a cold laugh. "Nearly restored? Sure, with time power, recovery can be quick! But even if she were at her peak, she still wouldn't stand a chance against Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just God of Time. Even I wouldn't be a match for Isa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure gasped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light waved a hand dismissively. "Just know this much! There's no need for further questions. Once God of Night returns, everything will become clear! I wonder what Isa is up to in the Sanctum of Night. I can't even reach her! If she would just step up and take charge, it would make everything so much easier...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she were willing to emerge, even if Lord Malevolence himself led an assault on the West Zone, we could hold out for a considerable time and avoid this dire predicament."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a weary gesture, she rubbed her temples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your eyes glued to the Sanctum of Night! The moment Isa shows up, let me know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure, still in shock, nodded and hurried off to carry out the orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light continued to gaze out the window, her thoughts heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, where are you? Can this risky plan of yours truly succeed? It's far too dangerous! If you fail, what will we do? What will become of the Human Community in Celestara? I can only hope you find success..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final deep breath, the God of Light returned to the main hall. "Gather the Dukedom Level Powers for a meeting! I have a feeling that the Dark Deity Legion will launch a full-scale attack within a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, within the Hudson family's residence, the members were deep in a frenzied state of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the endless supply of Celestial Crystals at their disposal, each member of the Hudson family was rapidly increasing their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro had gathered the most talented among them, distributing ample Miracle Elixirs to help them push toward the Supernal Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Hope Haven, Osborne and his companions were also engrossed in their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With better talent and greater resources, their progress was even swifter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was fully focused on his cultivation, immersed in a world where time seemed to stand still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the effect of a two-hundred-fold time acceleration, what felt like a single day outside stretched into 200 days for him. He was entirely absorbed in solidifying his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "To break through to Supernal Deity King, I need to merge the Divine Flame with the Divine Body! For me, it's the Infinite Sacred Flame and Infinite Sacred Body that must unite!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This step is incredibly challenging, requiring exceptional talent. Many can't even complete this stage, let alone ascend the Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real difficulty lies in standing firm on the Ascension Stairway once you're there. They say that after merging the Divine Flame and Divine Body, an infinitely long Ascension Stairway will appear before you. You must traverse it and pass its trials to become a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the trials? They vary for everyone... Some face direct divine power attacks, others battle against soul assaults, and some endure tests of will!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what my trial will be like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, I must take this step! Only by becoming a Supernal Deity King can I protect myself in the impending all-out war between the Dark Deity Legion and the Human Community, and perhaps even shift the tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been in seclusion for two years! My power is fully stabilized! Now, it's time to push for the Supernal Deity King Level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne appeared as ordinary as any other person, with no hint of power radiating from him, a testament to his mastery over his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled deeply, and an overwhelming force erupted from him, a power so intense it transcended mere purity, sheer dominance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Primordial expending 40 percent of the Tree Heart energy, Osborne's strength was compressed to its utmost limit, giving rise to a force that was leagues beyond others at the same level, far stronger by hundreds, even thousands of times, setting him in a league of his own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This overwhelming power filled Osborne with confidence. He felt assured that even now, he could stand toe-to-toe with an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this formidable power surged forth, it rapidly expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope Haven trembled violently, as if it could barely contain the force radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I can't break through here in Hope Haven! If I do, even if I don't destroy it outright, it'll be reduced to ruins! I need to break through in deep space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he vanished from Hope Haven, reappearing in the vastness of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by a kaleidoscope of shimmering void, Osborne's power swelled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Infinite Sacred Flame blazed fiercely, merging with his Infinite Sacred Body under the influence of an inexplicable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakthrough had begun!</span></p><div class="pagination">
