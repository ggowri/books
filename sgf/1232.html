  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep beneath the vast ocean, Mila sat on the ocean floor, her surroundings parting like the Red Sea to avoid her. She hugged her knees, boredom etched across her face as she waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are my mom and dad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the deal with the Sanctuary Necklace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ms. Divine Shadow a cat or a tiger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't remember anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Mister? Why isn't he back yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl murmured to herself, her perfect features illuminated by the shimmering water around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with innocence and purity, embodying the essence of a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl untouched by the complexities of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, if one looked closely, one would notice five blue Divine Flames flickering above her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila was no ordinary child; she was a deity&mdash;a Celestial Deity, to be precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hierarchy of divine beings, one Divine Flame indicated a Junior Deity, two for an Intermediate Deity, three for a Superior Deity, four for a Transcendent Deity, five for a Celestial Deity, six for a Deity Overlord, and seven for a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The structure of divinity resembled a pyramid, with higher-tier deities being increasingly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Celestial Deity warrior would be considered elite even in the Age of Gods, yet here she was, just a young girl!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her Divine Flames were blue, signifying a Divine Body far superior to that of an average deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Level Six Divine Body meant her divine power was more robust and potent than that of her peers, granting her extraordinary strength and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, she was a prodigy&mdash;an exceptional talent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though only two of her five Divine Flames were currently burning, with the others flickering dimly, this still indicated that her current strength was at the Intermediate Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was impressive enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mila wasn't training at all. Instead, the rich energy of the ocean was flowing into her body, slowly reigniting her third Divine Flame, which began to glow brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it wouldn't be long before her third flame blazed back to life, restoring her to Superior Deity strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, where is Mister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wouldn't just leave me here, would he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He promised to take me to see Ms. Divine Shadow! How could he break his word? How could he lie to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom and Dad, I'm scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After waiting for what felt like an eternity, worry crept into Mila's heart. The thought that Osborne might have abandoned her in this deep ocean weighed heavily on her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a figure appeared in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still disguised as a middle-aged man, he approached her with a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes lit up with joy as she darted towards him, her small frame moving faster than the eye could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, a wide smile spreading across her face, "You're back! I knew you wouldn't lie to me or leave me behind! I could feel a sense of trust and safety from you the moment I saw you! You wouldn't break your promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down at her, Osborne chuckled, scratching his nose. "You didn't deceive me, so I wouldn't deceive you, either! Now that I know for sure you're not connected to the Deschanel family, let's go back. I'll take you to meet Divine Shadow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's eyes sparkled with excitement at his words, her expression brimming with anticipation. She nodded vigorously, her enthusiasm palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get to see Ms. Divine Shadow again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she tightly grasped the hem of Osborne's clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne didn't hesitate. He used his interdimensional travel ability to teleport directly back to the Augustine Estate in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of heading to the Augustine Bastion, he made a beeline for the Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a doubt, Divine Shadow would be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, most of the Augustine family members had already relocated to the Augustine Bastion for safety&mdash;the place offered not only security but also a hundredfold more ambient cosmic energy for accelerated cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne once considered bringing Divine Shadow to the Augustine Bastion as well, but it was having none of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even his grandfather Sebastian could persuade her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was adamant about staying at Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suspected there might be some greater secret hidden in Mount Celestial Reach and even employed his Satan's Eye to scan the area thoroughly, only to find nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he reluctantly allowed Divine Shadow to remain on the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne and Mila stood at the top of Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their journey progressed, Mila gasped suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her little nose twitched as she sniffed the air, radiating an adorably canine quality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke with wide-eyed wonder, "I smell it! This is Ms. Divine Shadow's scent&mdash;she's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's excitement was palpable; she dashed off in a particular direction at incredible speed. Even Osborne struggled to keep pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swiftly, Mila arrived at the peak of Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She halted abruptly, fixing her gaze on a point where a dark gold cat lay lazing atop the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached, it lifted its head, its bright eyes meeting theirs, then sprang to its feet in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your Holiness, Sublime Saintess Mila!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
