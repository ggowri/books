  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing the situation of the battle, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It seemed that Serena had the upper hand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her weapon was a long and thin sword, which was usually hidden in her cane, but it was very sharp and was an ancient magic weapon.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The energy fluctuations above were not weaker than Osborne&#x27;s level three ancient magic weapon, Bronze Mirror.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So it&#x27;s at least a level three ancient magic weapon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne stared at Serena&#x27;s sword closely. The sword was very fast. Under Serena&#x27;s control, it completely turned into a ray of light and kept attacking Bruce.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if Osborne activated Satan&#x27;s Eye, it was difficult to capture the attack of the sword light.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bruce&#x27;s weapon was his cane. Although it was also strong and could bring up crazy waves every time it was swung, it still couldn&#x27;t withstand the sword light of Serena&#x27;s sword.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There were already several wounds on Bruce&#x27;s body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne knew that if Bruce continued to fight like this, he would be defeated, and it would be hard for him to escape.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ms. Hernandez is so strong.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are they just Class A masters? I feel like her level is more than one level higher than mine.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was shocked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There had been several Class A masters who died at his hands, but at this moment, he couldn&#x27;t fight against either Bruce or Serena.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If they wanted to kill Osborne, it was difficult for him to escape.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ms. Hernandez is so powerful, but she is just Godfather&#x27;s maid. When Godfather was young, he had eight maids like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So Godfather must be much more powerful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The King of the Aberrants can fight against Godfather and even return to Rosmandi to seek revenge on Godfather. He must also be powerful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m still weak.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s face was solemn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Originally, he felt that he was very good when he broke through to Class A, and he was strong in the world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although he didn&#x27;t say it, he felt proud in his heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But now, all his smugness was gone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Class A was not the end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It couldn&#x27;t ensure that he could live safely in this world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He still had to keep working hard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Boom!</p><p style="text-align:left;">The fluctuations of battle continued to erupt in the deep trench. After five minutes, both Serena and Bruce suddenly stopped.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Serena also suffered some injuries.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bruce was in a worse condition. His body was covered with wounds, and he was breathing heavily.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Bruce, I&#x27;ve said before that you were no match for me decades ago. Now, you are still no match for me. I let you run away last time, but this time, you will stay here forever.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Serena&#x27;s face was cold, filled with murderous intent.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bruce grinned and said coldly, &quot;Serena, I didn&#x27;t expect you to have made progress again. I lost to you again. But you can&#x27;t kill me. The one who will die today will not be me, but you!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Bruce&#x27;s words, Serena sneered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What other skills do you have?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bruce shrugged. &quot;No, I have used all my skills and can&#x27;t do anything to you. I have to say that Godfather is quite capable. He trained eight orphans into such masters. It&#x27;s amazing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But unfortunately, you will die here today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Godfather will die too. No matter how powerful he is, he is a human. Humans can&#x27;t compete with gods, and the great King of the Aberrants is a god.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;When he comes to Rosmandi again, the Draco Group will fall apart, and Godfather will die.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;This day will come soon.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Bruce finished speaking, Serena&#x27;s face became ugly, and she said coldly, &quot;The King of the Aberrants is nothing. Even if he is a god, Godfather will defeat him, and Godfather will kill the god himself.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Really? Hahaha.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Childish!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Bruce looked disdainful and said, &quot;Serena, you overestimate Godfather. He has been holding on for all these years. Forget it, I don&#x27;t want to talk to you about this. Now I will kill you first.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying this, Bruce made a whistling sound suddenly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In an instant, the trench began to shake violently, as if an earthquake had occurred. The surrounding reefs began to collapse and shatter, making Serena&#x27;s face become gloomy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She stared at the broken reef and tightened her grip on the sword.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was also surprised. As he looked at the broken reef, his face changed drastically.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After the reef collapsed, a figure appeared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a middle-aged man, who looked to be around 40 or 50 years old. He had been hiding among the rocks, and even Serena didn&#x27;t notice him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At this time, holding a huge black sickle in his hand, he looked at Serena with a smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Ms. Hernandez, long time no see.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Staring at the huge sickle, Serena said, &quot;Are you the disciple of the King of the Aberrants, the Soul Reaper, Chris Wood?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You have become so strong.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
