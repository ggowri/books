  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, who was frantically fleeing, suddenly felt an extreme danger. But she was too weak to dodge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only watch as the space around her shattered, collapsed inward, and unleashed a terrifying force that shattered her body, collapsing into a singularity and disappearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From start to finish, she didn't even have time to scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the Spatial Collapse was so powerful that even at her peak, she would have died if she hadn't escaped the core area in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the immense force of the Spatial Collapse restored the surrounding frozen space back to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered as he looked in the direction of Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, he waved his hand to open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, wait for me here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne stepped into the rift and appeared before Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and drained the air within a 328-foot radius. He used the Breath of Celestial to increase the flow, then punched Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan, towering at 33 feet tall, was instantly shattered by Osborne's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, only the fastest runner, Werewolf, was left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprinted away on all fours, fleeing rapidly. In no time, he had escaped several miles away, his speed leaving only a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne had Satan's Eye to lock onto him and spatial power to catch up quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tore open another rift with a cold laugh and stepped through it. In the next second, he appeared in front of Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf was terrified and immediately turned to change direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a futile struggle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne intercepted him again by warping through dimensions. This time, Osborne had already launched his attack before Werewolf could turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched Werewolf's waist, instantly breaking his spine. His body folded over, rolling on the ground several times before stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Werewolf was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed up blood violently and glared at Osborne with hatred. "Osborne, you won't have a good end! The King of The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will avenge us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Werewolf spat out blood mixed with bits of his organs. His head drooped forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a long breath and finally relaxed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five AAA-level powerhouses from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had surrounded and tried to kill him. Now, they were all dead by his hand. No one would believe this if it were told.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even encountering one AAA-level enemy, surviving would have been a miracle, let alone counterattacking and killing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne faced five AAA-level opponents. He not only survived but also killed all five. The battles were extremely difficult and dangerous. Several times, Osborne was on the verge of collapse and almost died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't learned the Deadly Force, which perfectly countered Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't had the Blood Cross, he could have transformed into a Blood Clan member, perfectly countering Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't had the Light of Redemption, which could cleanse negative effects, instantly heal his injuries and restore his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clarissa hadn't shown up in time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have been dead already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the ending was good. After killing the five AAA-level powerhouses, Osborne had a clearer understanding of his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne glanced at Werewolf's corpse and suddenly had an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the dense blood energy around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blood energy contained immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After transforming into Vampire, Osborne became incredibly sensitive to this blood energy. He hadn't paid much attention before. After fighting Vampire, he realized controlling blood energy was Vampire's greatest power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he controlled the enemy's blood, he could control their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the enemy died, the immense energy within their blood could still be used by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand slightly, and countless blood streams sprayed from Werewolf's body. The blood and scattered blood around him formed into a blood sword that Osborne grasped in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf's body instantly withered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the swirling blood energy in his hand. With a slight clench of his fist, the blood energy compressed into a bright red blood pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blood pearl was filled with immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate. His blood-red hair pierced the blood pearl. Within a few breaths, the blood pearl disappeared, and all its power was absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the Blood Cross within his body becoming more active. It seemed to be slowly awakening more power, providing Osborne with greater strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
