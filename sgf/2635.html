  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, we meet again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby's voice echoed in Osborne's mind, seeming more lively than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He directly asked, "Toby, I've passed the eighteenth trial. Can you give me the key to the Skyfall Casket now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said calmly, "The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is on the eighteenth level. As long as you clear the eighteenth level, you can obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the four of you cleared it together. If the other three agree to let you keep the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I can give it to you directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Toby fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps he is communicating with Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Toby said, "The three of them agreed to let me give you the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, so here, take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne noticed a faint red light appear in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the red light flickered, a space rift opened in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, something emerged from the space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blood-stained bronze spear looked very ordinary, and Osborne didn't sense any overwhelming energy. However, for some reason, the moment he saw the spear, Osborne couldn't help but widen his eyes. His entire body&rsquo;s blood seemed to boil, as if it was about to surge out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. As long as you insert it into the corresponding keyhole of the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you can open it and gain the qualification to venture into the Eighth Skyfall Casket," Toby said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Violet-blooded Bronze Spear? The key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is a spear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, gripping the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear with his hand. Instantly, he felt a chilling aura of slaughter surge from the bronze spear into his body. His body stiffened immediately, and the skin on his palm felt an intense sting, as if it were being corroded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly let go of the spear, as if a moment's delay would destroy his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately looked at the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear in astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What level of weapon is this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Man, even though most of the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear's power is sealed, it's still equivalent to an Imperial Artifact. Moreover, its quality is excellent. With your current strength, you can't control or use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Put it away. Maybe in the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you can find a way to repair the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear and restore its power from the Primeval War."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne felt utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this an Imperial Artifact? And of excellent quality? Most importantly, is most of its power sealed? What level was it originally?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is a Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It used to be the highest-level Sovereign Artifact in the cosmos. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the Primeval War, so its power had to be sealed to prevent it from shattering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sovereign Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial once said that the strongest people in the cosmos are called Masters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation level has all reached Sovereign Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, Drum's mother, the empress Kira, who ruled the cosmos for countless years, was known as the strongest Master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't expect this Violet-blooded Bronze Spear to be a Sovereign Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is the highest-grade Sovereign Artifact in the cosmos. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the Primeval War, so its power could only be sealed in the end, preventing it from shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even so, this Violet-blooded Bronze Spear still possesses the power of Imperial Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt incredibly excited. He originally planned to exchange battle points with Toby for an Imperial Artifact. Even if he couldn't use it for now, he could lend it to Adriana to better deal with Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he doesn't need to exchange it now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, is a powerful Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very excited and quickly put away the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued to ask, "There are nine Skyfall Caskets in total, so are there nine keys to the Skyfall Caskets hidden in this Celestial Spire? Have the other keys to the Skyfall Caskets also lost their power as Imperial Artifacts like the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby heard this and shook his head lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt very disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what Toby said next made Osborne excited again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby calmly said, "The keys to the other Skyfall Caskets are even more powerful than the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. They were once Sovereign Artifacts, but all of them have been damaged to some extent. Except for the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket, which is only comparable to an Imperial Artifact, the power of the keys to the other Skyfall Caskets far surpasses that of Imperial Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the key to the First Skyfall Casket is almost a complete Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened, and his breathing became extremely rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket also an Imperial Artifact? Do the keys to the other Skyfall Caskets surpass the power of Imperial Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that possible?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, is the key to the First Skyfall Casket an almost complete Sovereign Artifact?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is a Sovereign Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the very center of the universe, only a very few Sovereign Artifacts are held by those Masters, possessing earth-shattering power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, within the Celestial Spire, a nearly complete Sovereign Artifact is hidden."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened. According to the pattern, the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is on the twenty-seventh floor. They just need to clear the twenty-seventh floor to obtain it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to the Sixth Skyfall Casket is on the thirty-sixth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key to the First Skyfall Casket is on the eighty-first floor of the Celestial Spire. As long as they can clear the eighty-first floor, they will obtain the key to the First Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's breathing became even more rapid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he keeps clearing the levels, wouldn't his gains be...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne quickly shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew it was impossible. They had only reached the eighteenth floor, and he had to face a hundred warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate of difficulty increase, Osborne wasn't even confident he could clear up to the twenty-seventh floor and obtain the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearing all the way up is too hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, it's simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This isn't easy for anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought he could at most just covet the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket on the twenty-seventh floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but ask, "Can I ask in advance what the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby responded calmly, "If others asked me, I certainly wouldn't tell them. Since you've already obtained the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, and you have a chance to get the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket next, of course, I can answer you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is a bow..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is the Apocalypse Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apocalypse Bow was once the top-tier Sovereign Artifact, known as the number one bow in the cosmos. It had destroyed countless star clusters and killed innumerable warriors. Even warriors who reached Sovereign Empyrean Sacredness were slain by it. Unfortunately, it was also damaged. Now, most of its power is sealed, leaving only the strength of an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Toby finished speaking, Osborne widened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Apocalypse Bow?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The number one bow in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did it really destroy countless star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a celestial unit larger than a galaxy. Dozens of Racial Convergence Planets form a galaxy, and hundreds of galaxies make up a star cluster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did the Apocalypse Bow really destroy countless star clusters?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne felt his heart pounding wildly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must get the Apocalypse Bow!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
