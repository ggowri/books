  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, what are you doing back here?" Gerardo frowned as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the storage place for divine corpses, and he was in the middle of extracting the heart's blood from one of the fallen gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you hated it here. The sight of these corpses makes you feel uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She disliked being in the place. Somehow, seeing the four divine bodies filled her with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her first visit, she made it twice until today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Mr. Aniston, I have a question about my training and I can't wait any longer! I know you're waging war against </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and planning to take down the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Osborne's true identity&mdash;he's the grandson of Godfather Sebastian and the core of the Augustine family. If you destroy them, you won't let Osborne go, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said I want to take my revenge on him by myself! But I don't want to interfere </span><span>with your plans, Mr. Aniston. So, I hope to break through to Class S before you attack the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I can join you in the assault! I want to defeat Osborne myself, to humiliate him and take my revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's eyes burned with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression grew troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen, Ophelia. There's no need to rush. You're progressing at a fast pace! You're my most promising disciple! Right now, the important thing is to build a solid foundation rather than just chase after quick breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, if you continue to train, you'll become one of the </span><span>top Class</span><span> S warriors in no time&mdash;surpassing even me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, then added, "As for Osborne... you don't need to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to take revenge personally, I'll capture him alive! I'll bring him right to you, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia frowned tightly at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo said, "Look, what I'm about to do is really important! I promised I'd help you get your revenge, and I would keep that promise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait for me. Once I finish what I'm doing, I'll come find you and help you strengthen your abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Ophelia finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll head back! But remember, Mr. Aniston, you have to leave Osborne for me! I want him to regret everything he did to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise you, I will!" Gerardo smiled reassuringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ophelia turned to leave, Gerardo didn't notice the coldness that suddenly appeared on her face, her eyes flashing with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Gerardo, you're still deceiving me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne is already locked up in a Human Slave cultivation tank. In just three or four days, he'll be your Human Slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet you act like I don't know everything and promise to capture him for me to deal with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You are lying to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it has to be this way, then don't blame me for what I&rsquo;m going to do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, the reason I seek you as my mentor is simple. You have the power to make me strong&mdash;strong enough to finally take my revenge on Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since you want to turn Osborne into a Human Slave, cutting off my revenge, I'll change things my own way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You think I don't know you wiped out the entire Caldwell family? I've just been pretending, taking the time to build my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You made me do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stormed into her room, her heart raging with fury, yet her face remained eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed to a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she would allow Gerardo to turn Osborne into a Human Slave, stripping him of his consciousness and memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia mused, "I have to save him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmph! Osborne, you never expected that in your darkest hour, I would be the one trying to rescue you, did you? When you finally learn the truth, will you be shocked? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will you regret turning me down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crept onto her lips at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But saving you won't be easy! I need a good plan. Gerardo is no pushover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia fell into deep thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the heart of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' base, and even as Gerardo's disciple, she was under tight restrictions. Sneaking Osborne out without Gerardo catching wind of her intentions was very tricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it's not impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just needed to wait for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every few hours, she would freeze time and slip away to the Human Slave cultivation chamber, checking on Osborne to ensure he hadn't been enslaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the moment Ophelia had been waiting for arrived!</span></p><div class="pagination">
