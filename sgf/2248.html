  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's icy words sent a ripple of intense murmurs through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is toast! He's really pissed Vadim off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim follows through on his threats. If Osborne runs into him in the ring, he's going to be in serious trouble&mdash;Vadim won't hold back; he'll make sure he's badly hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can dodge Vadim for a bit longer and score a few wins, he might luck his way into the top ten! Otherwise, he's definitely looking at a last-place finish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over! The biggest dark horse is about to crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does he expect, acting all cocky and betting on himself to win like Vadim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comments caused Osborne to halt mid-step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to face Vadim, his voice calm but probing. "Have I offended you somehow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim sneered at him in contempt. "You? An Ascension Eight inner disciple? You're not even worth my anger for whatever offense you think you've committed. I just can't stand having scumbags like you tainting the Sect Tournament!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you've got the balls to hold your own when we face off in the arena. If you do, maybe I'll start to think of you differently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretty full of yourself, aren't you? You think you can take me down and kick me out of the tournament? I'm actually starting to look forward to crossing paths with you in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because when that happens, I'll give you exactly what you're asking for! It'll be so ironic to see a supposed championship hopeful end up in last place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's expression faltered for a second, and his face turned grim. "Trash, you really think you've got what it takes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you've got the goods!" Osborne retorted, locking eyes with Vadim unflinchingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't itching for a fight, but he sure as hell wasn't one to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Vadim was the hot-shot favorite to win the Sect Tournament and, on top of that, the nephew of Lenny. But he'd have to up his game if he thought he could rattle Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the arena, it was anyone's guess who'd come out on top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Just great!" Vadim </span><span>sneered,</span><span> his laughter laced with venom. "We'll see how this all shakes out! I can't wait to watch you, an Ascension Eight loser, eat dust behind me. Just remember&mdash;don't come crying for mercy when it's your turn to get thrashed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in the ring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vadim spun on his heel and walked away, leaving behind a menacing aura that hung thick in the air, palpable to everyone in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People looked at Osborne with a mix of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That dark </span><span>horse is</span><span> toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's poked the bear. I can already imagine the beating he's going to take in the arena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait to see it go down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne brushed off the whispers and walked away. To him, Vadim's provocation was nothing but a fleeting annoyance; he couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached the area at the foot of the arena and waited in silence while the buzz of conversation around him persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before too long, the high-ranking figures of the sect started to show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peak Lords, Elders, and even Lenny himself made their way onto the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela also joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this Sect Tournament, just as she'd foreseen, the other disciples from Peak Seven had completely bombed; not a single one of them had made it into the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Osborne's unexpected success, at least Peak Seven had a representative. Otherwise, they would have been in for even more humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angela tuned in to the chatter around her, her expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne picked a fight with Vadim? And he bet a hundred Sacred Crystals on himself to win the championship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel he was taking unnecessary risks.</span><br><span>He's getting a bit too full of himself, even for my standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it's because he's new to the Mystic Sirius Sect and has no idea how powerful Vadim really is. Or maybe yesterday's matches were just too easy for him, and now he's getting carried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betting on himself to win, and a whopping hundred Sacred Crystals! He's really riled up Vadim. I just hope they don't face each other too soon, or his chances of making it into the top ten will go down the drain, and he might end up at the bottom of the pack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head and let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire Peak Seven, Osborne was the only one who'd managed to make it into the top twenty. She had no choice but to pin all her hopes on him, secretly hoping he could make a splash and at least secure a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela didn't dare to set her expectations too high; deep down, she didn't really think Osborne could pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attention, everyone! The top twenty matches are about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All contestants for the top twenty, please come up to draw lots!" an Elder from Mystic Sirius Sect announced, his voice booming across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes wide, rising to his feet as he made his way to the stage, ready to draw his lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne felt a chilling gaze fixed on him from the side. Turning his head, he found Vadim standing there, a cold smirk plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Vadim's voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're in big trouble! I've got it all planned out. I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> be your first opponent! Hahaha. You'll end up flat on your back in the hospital! You thought you could mess with me? You're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Vadim, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Vadim has rigged the draw?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But considering Vadim was Lenny's nephew, it made sense he could pull some strings to ensure they faced off right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne wasn't intimidated in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained completely unfazed. He just flashed a smile at Vadim and said, "Hope you won't live to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took to the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it was time to draw lots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got number one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd be the first to go up against the other contestant who'd also drawn number one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot a look at Vadim, who'd just finished drawing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching Osborne's eye, Vadim let out a sneer and waved the number in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Number one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt Vadim had rigged the draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First match&mdash;Vadim from Peak One versus Osborne from Peak Seven! Contestants, get ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Elder made the announcement, the crowd went wild. Excitement was written all over countless faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it comes! Here it comes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought they'd go up against each other this early!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The defending champion and the front-runner up against the most unexpected wildcard! Hahaha, is the wildcard's journey about to end before it even begins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you reckon he'll throw in the towel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most likely! If he doesn't, Vadim will wipe the floor with him! He won't be fit to continue in the tournament after that&mdash;he's surely headed for last place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were him, I'd bail out right away! Vadim is a beast. Losing to him is no disgrace, and admitting defeat isn't embarrassing. After all, a good ranking matters more than blind pride!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! He's probably kicking himself for getting on Vadim's bad side. Who'd have thought they'd meet in the very first match..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yikes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's chatter only made Vadim's smile widen. He dashed up to the stage, beckoning Osborne with a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, get up here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weren't you just so cocky? If you've got the guts, don't you dare surrender! I promise I won't kill you. I'll just keep you in bed for a few months!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wore an expression of pure provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, stepping onto the stage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
