  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Deschanel family, among the thirty-six awakened divine warriors, only Joseph boasted a Level Four Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest, thirty-five in total, primarily possessed Level Two Divine Bodies, with only a handful reaching Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that during the Age of Gods, the Deschanel Clan stood as a formidable divine clan in the east, home to numerous divine warriors. They had ultimately selected just one hundred of their finest to take refuge in the Sanctuary Casket, escaping the impending disaster brought on by Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each chosen one was a prodigy of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite their talents, most of them only achieved Level Two or Level Three Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elevating a Divine Body was far more challenging than merely advancing in rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a Divine Body was forged, it could only undergo three further transformations, no matter how diligently one trained. This meant that if a Divine Body was initially forged at Level Two, the highest it could ever attain was Level Five. Conversely, if it was forged at Level Four, it could reach up to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why using Phoenix Ascension on Blood Demon members to elevate their Divine Bodies by two levels&mdash;bringing them to Level Three or even Level Four&mdash;was nothing short of a miracle for those with average talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It transformed them into overwhelming powerhouses almost overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!" Osborne </span><span>declared,</span><span> his eyes gleaming with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family and the Thornberry family were on the brink of an epic clash, and he was determined not to miss out. After confirming that each Blood Demon Vanguard member had mastered Phoenix Ascension, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast blood energy he had gathered surged forth, flooding into the bodies of the Blood Demon Vanguard members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy was so potent that it would allow each of them to refine their Divine Bones and Divine Flesh. If they had attempted to absorb such a colossal force on their own, it would have taken them months, if not years, to achieve even a Level One Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Osborne being the progenitor of the Blood Clan and their direct ancestor, he infused them with this immense blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies reacted violently, their Divine Bones and Divine Flesh rapidly taking shape at an astonishing pace&mdash;dozens, even hundreds of times faster than a regular person's refining process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Activate Phoenix Ascension!" Osborne commanded in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the power within each Blood Demon Vanguard surged along specific pathways, igniting a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spectral phoenixes materialized behind them, majestic and divine, exuding an aura of untouchable grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred Blood Demon Vanguard members, each accompanied by a phoenix apparition, created a breathtaking spectacle as overwhelming power coursed through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member of the Blood Demon Vanguard had successfully activated Phoenix Ascension. At that moment, their Divine Bones and Divine Flesh began a deeper refinement, unlocking their potential and enhancing their innate abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eyes closed and sweat pouring down their faces, the one hundred members expelled thick, dark impurities from their bodies. These were the deep-seated toxins that, once eliminated, would purify and strengthen their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how many </span><span>Level</span><span> Four Divine Bodies will emerge from this?" Osborne murmured, filled with eager anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for now, there was no way to tell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Phoenix Ascension, the unique characteristics of the Blood Demon members meant that, given enough blood energy, they could quickly forge Divine Bodies and ascend to divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of the intricacies of Phoenix Ascension, their bodies required a more profound refinement, which would take additional time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne estimated it might take three days, but that was still remarkably swift!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, I'll command a hundred Junior Deity-level Blood Demon subordinates! Each one at least possesses a Level Four Divine Body, if not more!" Osborne </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having a hundred Junior Deities under his command was no small feat. Apart from the League of Divine Descent, he doubted any other superpower could boast such a formidable force at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in just three days, Osborne's grandfather Sebastian, along with Bryce, Anastasia, and Matthew, were expected to successfully forge their Divine Bodies and ascend to godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all extraordinary talents, and with the Phoenix Ascension, their Divine Bodies wouldn't be anything less than Level Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Deity-level warriors in the Augustine family was set to skyrocket, making them even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending some time at the Augustine Bastion to ensure the Blood Demon Vanguard's recent breakthroughs were stable and without issues, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about time. The gods of the Deschanel family should have arrived in Marcelin by now. And then there's the Thornberry family&mdash;the strongest Divine Family within the League of Divine Descent. Just how powerful are they? I'll find out soon enough! I can only hope the League and the Deschanel family weaken each other in the process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne casually tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Newport City, </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, lay over three thousand miles away from Marcelin. It took Osborne five interdimensional travels to finally breach Marcelin's borders.</span></p><div class="pagination">
