Her spine had been severely compromised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength eclipsed even the peak prowess of Cuthbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne's transformation into a Vampire, his power more than doubled, and with the Breath of Celestial, it surged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, he could threaten ordinary Class S Supreme Overlords without any martial arts techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett, while formidable, relied heavily on her Stealth Art and the Level Three Plant Realm; her physical abilities were no match for Osborne's overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, Scarlett was badly injured, blood pouring from her lips as she flew backward over a hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could even hit the ground, Osborne appeared directly in front of her, icy indifference etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another calculated kick sent Scarlett's body slamming down onto the arena like a rag doll, her consciousness slipping away before she could utter a single sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her defeat, the Plant Realm dissipated into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp echoed through the crowd gathered to watch the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone rose to their feet in disbelief as they took in the sight of the unconscious Scarlett and the undeniably victorious Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock painted their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments prior, they had seen Osborne struggling and desperately losing ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed he was on the verge of defeat, his energy rapidly draining against Scarlett's tireless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed impossible for him to overcome her&mdash;her Level Three Plant Realm and devastating Stealth Art positioned her as a substantial threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, in the blink of an eye, the situation had flipped completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most onlookers hadn't even registered the moment Osborne turned the tide until he had delivered one brutal kick after another, leaving Scarlett battered and unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had emerged victorious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into a cacophony of cheers and gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Class S warriors on the elevated platform stared wide-eyed in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members' joyful cries rang out above the rest. Many had tears in their eyes, overwhelmed by a mix of disbelief and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won! He actually defeated Scarlett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's feat not only ended the match but also secured him a remarkable hundred consecutive victories, marking him as the first legend in the Augustine family's history to achieve this milestone and the tenth in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone had suggested just hours earlier that Osborne would accomplish such a feat during the Honor Quest Ceremony, none would have believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would've felt like nothing short of bragging rights&mdash;an impossible dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here Osborne was, defying all expectations and completing a legendary hundred consecutive victories while everyone else had counted him out, convinced he'd somehow turn this prestigious event into a disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each face among the Augustine family radiated pride, a swelling sense of honor filling the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the ecstatic family celebrated, someone dashed to Scarlett's side, scooping her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly woman glared at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her face etched with fury as she assessed Scarlett's severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Osborne! How dare you hurt Scarlett? Do you even know who she is? You're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely scoffed in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't care less who she is! She stepped into the arena, which makes her my challenger. In the ring, punches and kicks are blind; her injuries are just proof of her weakness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old woman's anger only intensified at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine!
