  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa began to tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face appeared in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's mother died when she was very young. It was Donna who raised her and who always stayed by her side to take care of her and protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Clarissa, Donna didn't give birth to her, but she was no different from her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offended Newport City's Augustine family, and they would definitely retaliate. If she insisted on being with Osborne, it would kill everyone in the Radcliffe family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna would die...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Barlyn would die...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was a little ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan seemed to sense her hesitation and quickly continued, "Clarissa, you are my daughter. Everything I did was for your own good. I admit that I made mistakes in judgment before and underestimated Osborne. But the situation is different now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He offended the Augustine family. No matter how powerful Osborne is, he will be doomed sooner or later! The Augustine family is not the Paltrow family. Even if there are a hundred Paltrow families, they are definitely not a match for the </span><span>Augustines</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I won't agree to you marrying Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trembled even more violently, turning to Osborne and biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sad smile suddenly appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally spoke, "Dad, I understand what you mean. Then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan looked at Clarissa expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So did Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled and continued, "Then, I will... sever ties with the Radcliffe family! The Radcliffe family can just disown me, so there's no need to worry about revenge from the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I will face it together with Osborne! Even if the Augustine family wants to kill Osborne, I will stand in front of him and protect him with my body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever wants to kill Osborne must kill me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body shook, and he stared at Clarissa's pretty face intently, feeling warm and touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Clarissa's hand tightly and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deeply moved. Clarissa didn't know the true relationship between him and Godfather, but she was very clear about the consequences of offending the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, Clarissa still chose to be with him and face it with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne not be moved?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that he must have done too many good things in his previous life, so he was so lucky in this life to have Clarissa's love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged Clarissa tightly and swore in his heart that he would protect her no matter what and never let her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Dylan and Eugen looked extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan snarled, "Asshole!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, we are your family! The Radcliffe family raised you, gave you the best life, and offered you the best education, but you want to cut off ties with us for a man? You want to leave with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shivered and left Osborne's arms, biting her lip and looking at Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'm grateful for your kindness in raising me, and I've never forgotten that you are my family. However, if it weren't for Osborne, I would have died fifteen years ago! If it weren't for Osborne, I would have died when the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> assassinated me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Osborne, I would have been forced by you to marry Alexander. My life would have been ruined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you tell me, what should I do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are worried about being retaliated by the Augustine family, but I am not! Nothing can scare me as long as I'm with Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's not me who wants to sever ties with the Radcliffe family, but you guys who force me to do so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please! Stop forcing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes were filled with tears, and her look was a whole of pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been forced all her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a child, Clarissa yearned for the world beyond the manor walls, desiring the freedom to play and enjoy herself as other children did, yet her family compelled her to master various skills that she had no interest in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon growing up, she was labeled the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, which led to her exile from the Radcliffe family to prevent an ill fortune. In </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, Clarissa resided alone in a manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Donna not pitied her and opted to care for her in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, she would have been even lonelier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she was forced to become Apollo's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa resisted. She didn't want to marry Apollo, but no one cared about her feelings at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Apollo died. Clarissa thought she was free and could finally pursue her own happiness. She even announced in public that she and Osborne were together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was forced to separate from Osborne, come to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, and marry Alexander against her will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was forced!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From birth, her family had pressured her to comply with unwanted tasks under the guise of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she didn't want that anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having found her true love, she would not relinquish it again, even if it meant death, as she was resolute in her choice. No one could make her back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Clarissa's eyes as she stared at Dylan with a highly determined look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke word by word, "I will be with Osborne and bear the consequences with him! Please don't force me anymore!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
