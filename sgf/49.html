  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia nodded in agreement, sharing the same thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They all believed that someone as noble as Clarissa could never have any feelings for a commoner like Osborne. Her previous embrace was just out of excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was out of Clarissa&rsquo;s league.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ha, Osborne dreaming of snagging to the Radcliffe family? That&rsquo;s pure fantasy. Unless Clarissa has lost her mind, there&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;d have anything with him. And to top it off, there&rsquo;s Donna standing in the way.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both of them felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, the first stage of the assessment had reached its end, with the tenth group finishing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Among them emerged a powerhouse who completed the challenge in a remarkable one minute and forty seconds, leaving even their competitors in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, it was Osborne&rsquo;s turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As there were only a hundred and one participants, he was the last to go, entering the stage alone without any competitors alongside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All eyes were on Osborne at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at the rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fifth spot was secured at exactly two minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In other words, to make it to the top five, he had to complete the challenge within two minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Two minutes, huh?&rdquo; Osborne murmured, ultimately choosing a handgun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite the disadvantage of handguns in long-range target shooting, as proven by the previous participants, and the time wasted in reloading due to their smaller magazines, Osborne still opted for a handgun with a thirty-round capacity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why? Because he was most familiar with handguns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Number one hundred and one, are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne confirmed, securing two spare magazines and nodding at the assessor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, begin!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the assessor&rsquo;s command, the timer started, and Osborne dashed out like a cheetah, swiftly aiming and firing at the first target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Osborne&rsquo;s hands, the handgun seemed to transform into a semi-automatic rifle, hitting target after target at close range as if they were dominoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gasps filled the air, but Osborne remained unfazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been diligently practicing his marksmanship for the past few days, firing tens of thousands of rounds. With his increasing physical strength and steady hands, his shooting skills had vastly improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the assistance of Satan&rsquo;s Eye, his accuracy was impeccable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whether it was mid-range shooting while moving, long-range sniping after vaulting over obstacles, or rapid-moving target shooting, Osborne handled it all with just a handgun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not a single bullet missed its mark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maintaining his rhythm, Osborne swiftly cleared all sixty targets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced at the timer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He only took one minute and ten seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A smile crept onto Osborne&rsquo;s face as he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The previous top time was one minute and forty seconds, and he had surpassed it by a whopping thirty seconds, establishing a significant lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And this was without giving his all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was confident he could improve his time to under a minute, but that would be too extravagant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, his one hundred competitors watched him in shock, realizing he was their biggest threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the high platform, Wesley and Ophelia were both dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, didn&rsquo;t you say Osborne would only rank in the middle? Is this middle? This is bloody smashing, way ahead of second place.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia bit her lip, unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She, too, was astonished. With three years of marriage to Osborne and three years of him silently acting as her bodyguard to ensure her safety, she had no idea his marksmanship was this exceptional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna chimed in, &ldquo;This guy surprises me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Beside her, Clarissa fought back a smile, maintaining her icy composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just average,&rdquo; Clarissa remarked coolly. &ldquo;In the same assessment, my head of security, Paul Duncan, could probably manage it in about a minute. Mr. Augustine has quite a ways to go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna glanced at Clarissa upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Clarissa&rsquo;s indifferent and almost disdainful expression, she couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa, you&rsquo;ve got it wrong. Who is Captain Paul? He&rsquo;s a marksman and top-tier in martial arts. That&rsquo;s how he manages it in about a minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, Osborne is quite impressive already.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa said indifferently, &ldquo;Really? I don&rsquo;t understand these things, I just know he&rsquo;s not the best.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna smiled faintly, leaving it at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, the second phase of the assessment had commenced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second phase involved an emergency retreat scenario, where participants had to protect a dummy while dodging a barrage from ten simulated firearms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fewer hits the dummy took, the higher the score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once the second phase concluded, both Wesley and Ophelia fell silent because, once again, Osborne had taken the lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The dummy he protected hadn&rsquo;t been hit by a single simulated bullet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, the runner-up had been struck five times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clear dominance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the firing range, Osborne had now become everyone&rsquo;s target.</p><div class="pagination">
