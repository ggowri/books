  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The site of their mission, the 53rd mining area, was located right beneath Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived, Osborne could clearly feel the energy of the surroundings intensifying, though it was thick with a heavy scent of death that made it impossible to absorb for power enhancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the unique energy that could elevate one's comprehension was also incredibly potent here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to what Osborne had learned, entering a meditative state in this area could boost one's insight tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, the speed of refining Essence Crystals could increase several times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But training here was fraught with danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful boost in insight came at a cost&mdash;hallucinations could easily arise, and those with insufficient soul power risked losing their sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher one's level, the more susceptible they were to these dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered these risks, Riley, Emmett, and the others came to a halt ahead of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, looks like our luck is holding out this time. We haven't run into any trouble along the way. This mission might go smoother than usual," Emmett said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let your guard down! You know the situation here. Just because we haven't faced any danger doesn't mean we're in the clear. Let's all stay on high alert and head to the extraction zone first," Riley replied, casting a glance back at Osborne and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you take the lead and scout ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at the unexpected command. Riley hadn't given him any orders throughout their journey, but now, at the 53rd mining area, he was finally </span><span>calling the shots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Sending me to scout ahead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked toward the dark, foreboding tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extraction zone lay 30 miles underground, and they would have to navigate a winding tunnel over 60 miles long to reach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This section of the tunnel was notorious for unexpected dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne arrived, two early-stage Deity Overlord warriors had always scouted ahead together. Their strength allowed them to handle any surprises while waiting for Riley and the others to back them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Riley was sending Osborne in alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett and the others exchanged smirks at this turn of events, while Diana's expression turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Raglan, this isn't right! The tunnels are dangerous. In the past, it was always Hayden Rance and Dakota Rance who scouted together. Even then, they often ran into trouble. Are you really sending Osborne to his death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is just at the early stage of Celestial Deity! If he encounters any trouble, he won't stand a chance. He could easily die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice was filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley scoffed at her words. "Diana, this isn't your concern. Just focus on your own duties! Besides, we're in Divine Peak Nine. We all have to face danger and be prepared for the worst!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since Osborne is part of the guard team, he needs to contribute. We've all taken turns scouting for the last thousands of miles, and now it's his turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a 60-mile tunnel. If he can't handle scouting, what good is he to us? Moreover, this is an order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all know the consequences of disobeying orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley's expression was cold and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cheeks flushed red with anger; her fists clenched tightly as if she wanted to argue with Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne reached out and gently held her arm. "Diana, it's okay. As a member of the guard team, I need to contribute and follow orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just scouting, so I'll do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped boldly into the depths of the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cruel smile appeared on Riley's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a pathetic Human Community member, thinking he can defy my orders? Offending the Soaring Lion Clan? I could make your death a reality in countless ways."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett and the others snickered at Osborne, their faces painted with disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seethed with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne walk</span><span> bravely into the dark tunnel all alone hurt her deeply. She bit her lip, determination set in her eyes, and rushed after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go with Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley shrugged, his dismissive smirk growing wider. "Suit yourself! Having you, a </span><span>cursed individual, away from us just makes us safer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana was furious but held her tongue. She quickly caught up to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not familiar with this place; let me handle the scouting. I have good luck&mdash;I wouldn't have survived this long otherwise! Just stay half a mile behind me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, touched by her concern, smiled back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for looking out for me, but this is my job. I don't let my friends take risks for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he continued further into the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, staring at Osborne in disbelief, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you just call me... friend?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
