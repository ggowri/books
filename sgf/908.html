  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a pained scream as Isa's kick sent him flying across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the force behind her strike wasn't overwhelming by Class AAA standards, but with her martial arts finesse, it was enough to send him flying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being stronger in raw power, he was completely unprepared for the skill she wielded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Explosive Force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that what she's using? At such a refined level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly recovering, Osborne scrambled to his feet, his expression grave. Isa's control over her power was beyond his imagination. With controlled force from Isa, Osborne was actually uninjured though he looked battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Isa nodded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just average Class AAA strength, but with a refined level of Explosive Force! This is all I'm bringing to the table today. If you can beat me, then I'll let you call the shots."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it! I'm going to take you down today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Transformation! The Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he knew his Explosive Force wasn't as potent as Isa's, he felt confident that with his transformation and the Breath of Celestial, his absolute strength surpassed hers by at least tenfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, victory was a sure thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go again!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne charged at her with renewed vigor, ready to unleash his Explosive Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked out with all his might, and Isa</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s leg struck out in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no fancy tricks this time; it was a straightforward clash of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Osborne's face as their legs collided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, he was sent flying once more, crashing hard onto the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained rooted in place, unaffected by the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was like a child pitting himself against a grow-up and got kicked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded. To the onlookers, it was a shocking display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had proven his strength time and again, having bested Scarlett, Bradley, and Marlon, who had ended up being in a bad shape after the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many believed his power had already surpassed the Class AAA threshold, putting him above even some Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now they were witnessing something extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, a powerhouse in his own right, was being toyed with by Isa as if he were a child facing a strong grown man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in disbelief as they watched Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally get it! This is why the Prophet Alliance made her the top ranker in the Godson Rankings! With that kind of strength, she must make even the average Class S Supreme Overlords look like toys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne doesn't stand a chance; he's got no hope left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Augustine family were left speechless, watching in shock as their once-mighty Osborne was treated like a plaything. Their hearts sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Clarissa and Emma stared tightly at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They, too, were stunned by the display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really the Isa that Osborne warned us about?" Emma murmured, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it all made sense. She finally understood why Osborne had cautioned her to steer clear of Isa. Back then, Emma couldn't imagine that anyone could be stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as Emma witnessed Osborne being tossed around like a rag doll, she understood what Osborne was saying. Fear crept into her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't shake off the feeling</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>Isa was terrifyingly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What frightened her the most was that Osborne, despite looking utterly defeated and humiliated, hadn't sustained any real injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had, he wouldn't be able to get up at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a testament to Isa's mastery over her power, a level of control that was simply beyond their imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there really anyone in Class AAA who can take her down? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn't shake off these thoughts as they watched the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lay sprawled on the arena floor, his gaze unfocused, panting heavily. He was exhausted, drained of any strength to rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's power was overwhelming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he hadn't been physically harmed, his energy had been run out from the relentless exchanges, leaving him struggling to even lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his efforts, Osborne hadn't even managed to scratch the surface of Isa's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who wouldn't feel hopeless in such a situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that Isa was holding back, not even fighting at full throttle, yet he found himself utterly outmatched, crushed from all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey? Giving up already?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sauntered over, a playful smile lighting up her face as she leaned down to peer at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to have your own way with me? Is this how it ends? I told you to recover to your peak before challenging me, but you rushed in too soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Get up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Your Light of Redemption should be ready, right? Hurry up and restore yourself; I want to see your full strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Osborne snapped to attention, sitting up with a determined glare and gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Light of Redemption!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
