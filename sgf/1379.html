  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself at the deepest part of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path ahead ended abruptly, but that posed no challenge for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his injuries, which had diminished his power to the point where even a Junior Deity could easily overpower him, Osborne still had the ability to carve out tunnels with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he possessed earth elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't his primary power, navigating through the soil was a breeze for him. As Osborne reached the end of the tunnel, he felt as if he had plunged into the water, his form vanishing into the depths of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For me, mining is a walk in the park. With my powers and the combination of my Satan's Eye and earth elemental abilities, I can easily gather a mountain of Essence Crystals. But for others, it's a different story. They have to rely solely on their own strength to break through the rock. The stone here is incredibly tough; even a Junior Deity would struggle to make headway. Finding Essence Crystals really comes down to luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he ventured deeper into the mountain, sensing stronger energy fluctuations emanating from the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Osborne encountered numerous Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was, after all, a mining area that hadn't been fully exploited yet, and the number of crystals here was impressive. This time, he didn't hesitate; he collected every Essence Crystal he came across and stored them in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence was severely depleted, and opening the Dimensional Space was pushing his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Osborne pressed on, moving deeper into the mine for several hundred miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of his journey, he had amassed at least 30 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals, all neatly tucked away in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's more than most human miners would gather in years. Yet, 30 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals won't do much for my injuries or the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the Lotus won't even absorb low-grade energy! I need mid-grade or even top-grade Essence Crystals to help it recover. I can only hope there are some down here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued his descent, he couldn't shake the feeling that the heart of the mountain held something more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mining area was massive; even with thousands of human miners from hundreds of villages working tirelessly, it would take centuries to fully excavate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Essence Crystals he had gathered were merely a drop in the bucket compared to what lay hidden within the mountain's depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rock was so solid that even his Satan's Eye could only penetrate a few hundred yards. Beyond that, he was blind to the crystals that might be waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed on, hoping to uncover mid-grade or top-grade Essence Crystals and see if they could aid in the recovery of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single mid-grade Essence Crystal contained ten times the energy of a low-grade one and was ten times purer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one could be exchanged for a hundred low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for a top-grade Essence Crystal, it was worth a hundred mid-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, these were exceedingly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had traversed hundreds of miles within the mine, yet he still hadn't stumbled upon a single mid-grade Essence Crystal, let alone a top-grade one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the number of low-grade Essence Crystals in his Dimensional Space had surpassed 50 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, deep in thought. "Could it be that this mining area is completely devoid of any mid-grade or top-grade Essence Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry did mention that </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> sometimes roam these depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here I am, making my way through without having spotted a single one. Have I just been lucky so far?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he froze. As if his thoughts had summoned it, something strange caught his eye in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an entity, slick and without form, glowing a sinister blood-red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It moved with an eerie grace, swimming effortlessly through the dark earth like a wraith. Osborne felt its presence keenly; it was honing in on him, zeroing in with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes narrowed, tension coiling in his gut. "What a coincidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mention </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, and one shows up? How can it sense me from such a distance, traversing through all this rock? Can it smell my life force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as the implications settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had caught his scent, and he faced a choice: should he flee this place, or was it better to confront the creature and continue his quest for mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking stock of the situation, he sensed the creature's energy. "This </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> doesn't seem too formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy signature indicates it's just a Class S. Even in my weakened state, I should be able to handle it. Guess it's time to test its mettle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolved, Osborne tightened his grip on his power and moved toward the approaching creature, determined not to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he closed the distance, Osborne could see the </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> feral nature clearly&mdash;its intelligence barely flickering, more beast than anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sensed Osborne's life force, its instinct kicking in as it lunged forward recklessly, uncaring of the gap in their strengths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
