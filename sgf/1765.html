  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, what do you mean by that?" Cicero and Benno shot back, and their anger was palpable at Jethro's insinuation that some might have already aligned with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cicero's voice dripped with disdain. "Are you suggesting that we've turned traitor to Lord Malevolence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've lost your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone is cozying up to him, it's you, Jethro! After all, you're the one who keeps sneaking into Lord Malevolence's territory under the guise of searching for your daughter. You come back each time unscathed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows what kind of deal you've struck with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benno chimed in with a mocking laugh, "Exactly! Your search for your daughter is just a cover for leaking information about Human Community! If anyone's betrayed us, it's undoubtedly you, Jethro!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What has Lord Malevolence promised you? How could you betray your own people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men leveled their accusations at Jethro, and their expressions were twisted in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro remained calm, unfazed by their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they raged, the more his disdain for them grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep down, you know who's truly betrayed Human Community and aligned with Lord Malevolence. Save your slander for someone who cares. I'm not afraid!" Jethro shot back, and his voice was steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Cicero and Benno, he turned to God of Light, and his tone was earnest. "Esteemed God of Light, I stand by my position! While the origins of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings may be shrouded in mystery, their identities as members of our community are genuine! Even if it's a trap, it's a risk worth taking. We've reached the edge of a cliff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If no one else is willing to venture into East Zone, I, Jethro, will volunteer to lead the warriors of the Hudson family to bring back the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jethro finished, murmurs erupted among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I think you just want to lead the Hudson family warriors off to East Zone to escape!" Cicero sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benno joined in, scoffing. "Right! You're just looking for a way out! We all know that some among us have betrayed Human Community, and you, Jethro, are the prime suspect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried your identity will be exposed? Trying to take the Hudson family warriors and run? That makes perfect sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Esteemed God of Light, I propose we place Jethro and the entire Hudson family under house arrest! They shouldn't be allowed to leave, and if it turns out Jethro has betrayed us and aligned with Lord Malevolence, we should eliminate the entire Hudson family without hesitation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a cold glint of malice flashed in both Cicero and Benno's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro frowned at their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, God of Light finally spoke, and her expression was as calm as ever, as if she were in complete control of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of this bickering! There's no need for debate on this matter. I will handle it myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether we go to East Zone to rescue the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings is a decision I will make alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a decisive wave of her hand, she commanded, "You all may leave! And remember Paramount Supreme Clan is preparing to lead Dark Deity Legion in a full-scale assault on Human Community in West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not a rumor. It's a looming reality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The final battle is upon us, so everyone must be ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words sank in, the atmosphere shifted dramatically. Faces turned pale, and fear flickered in many eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final battle was imminent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the current strength of Human Community, how could they possibly withstand Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Lord Malevolence chose not to intervene, they would likely struggle to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all present felt the weight of the impending crisis, and the urgency of the situation overshadowed their previous concerns about the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Jethro bit his lip, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the others filed out of the vast Sanctum of Light, the grand chamber fell silent, leaving only God of Light seated on her throne. Her chin rested on her hand, and she was deep in contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a figure materialized beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a stunning woman, whose gaze was sharp and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light exclaimed, surprise flickering across her features, "God of Time, did you finally decide to show yourself? Did you actually leave your time nest? Have you fully regained your strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not completely, but I'm close enough. I came here to ask you about Isa. Where is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's brow furrowed at the mention of Isa. "What do you want with Isa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an icy smirk, God of Time replied, "What do I want? I just got word that Isa is claiming to be both God of Night's disciple and his... woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does she think she is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me where she is! I need to confront her and find out what her relationship with him really is. God of Light, I won't hold it against you if you don't tell me where God of Night is, but if you refuse to tell me where Isa is, then we might as well not be friends anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's piercing gaze locked onto God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's expression tightened, and her struggle was evident as she weighed her options.</span></p><div class="pagination">
