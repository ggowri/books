  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Nine realized the negotiations had collapsed and the Shadow Terror Fiend was charging at him, his expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While deflecting the Shadow Terror Fiend's onslaught, he called out, "Creation Herald, you're being foolish! You're barely holding on, and yet you cling to this crumbling divine peak? Why not just open it entirely to us, the Paramount Supreme Clan? If the esteemed Lord Malevolence gains strength from this, he won't forget your assistance. Who knows? He might even come to your rescue! Don't seek your own doom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend burst into laughter, a sound filled with derision. "Ha! You think I'm seeking my own doom? You Paramount Supreme Clan are truly delusional! Even if Lord Malevolence were here, he wouldn't dare speak to me like that! If it weren't for my... well, let's just say, you asking me to open up the divine peak to you is a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll wipe you out and send a clear message to Lord Malevolence! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Shadow Terror Fiend's attacks intensified, his power surging several times over. Icy Nine, who had been able to hold his ground, suddenly found himself overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can still increase your power? Have you lost your mind? Don't you care about your own well-being? Stop!" Icy Nine shouted, but his warning came too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend struck him with a devastating blow, sending him hurtling backward, blood spraying from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, as Icy Nine flew through the air, three other Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan rushed in, intercepting the Shadow Terror Fiend's follow-up attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a massive surge of life energy erupted from one of the Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, enveloping Icy Nine and beginning to heal his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed from a distance, his eyes wide with surprise, "Life power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really the rare life power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fixated on the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, and a flicker of murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life power was incredibly scarce. If he could eliminate this Supernal Deity King and extract his memories to give to Hannah, her strength would undoubtedly skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, having an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King with life power on the battlefield was a game changer. With him around, even if his allies faced deadly attacks, they could recover quickly, just like Icy Nine was doing now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion is gathering in the West Zone! It's only a matter of time before they launch a full-scale assault on the Human Community. If I could take out that life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, it would produce a massive benefit to the Human Community! But alas, with my current strength, taking down an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King is beyond my reach, even if he is a support type..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the Shadow Terror Fiend, thinking, "I can only hope the Shadow Terror Fiend manages to wipe out these Paramount Supreme Clan's Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are over fifty of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they all fall, it would be a tremendous loss for the Paramount Supreme Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after watching for a while, Osborne quickly realized that with the Shadow Terror Fiend's current strength, it was nearly impossible to eliminate this group of Paramount Supreme Clan's Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend was only slightly stronger than Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with three Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings and more than ten Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings backing Icy Nine, they worked together seamlessly, making it incredibly difficult for the Shadow Terror Fiend to take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless the Shadow Terror Fiend could somehow boost his power even further!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to their exchange, Osborne pieced together a chilling revelation&mdash;the Shadow Terror Fiend, referred to as the "Creation Herald," was not his true form. His real body possessed immense power, possibly even surpassing that of Lord Malevolence. Yet, it was currently facing a dire calamity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this calamity be connected to the World Tree's offshoots? Every divine peak houses a humanoid statue at its core, and that statue bears an uncanny resemblance to the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those statues are entwined with massive roots. Could it be that the offshoot of the World Tree is battling against the Shadow Terror Fiend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne observed the fierce battle unfolding before him, his mind raced with possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conflict was intense, yet as he had anticipated, despite the Shadow Terror Fiend gaining the upper hand, he was struggling to defeat Icy Nine and his allies, let alone wipe them out entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The primary reason for this was the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King wielding life power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that life power in play, Icy Nine and his team felt no fear of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the Shadow Terror Fiend couldn't take them out in one shot, their wounds would heal rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend was acutely aware of this, and his fury grew as he repeatedly attempted to charge at the life-powered Ascension Three Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could eliminate that life source, the Shadow Terror Fiend was confident he could defeat Icy Nine and his companions, possibly even annihilate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But each time, Icy Nine and his team managed to intercept him just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene unfold, Osborne felt a surge of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King is entirely focused on healing! The others are fixated on the Shadow Terror Fiend. If I strike now, I bet no one will see me coming. I could have a real shot at success!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I can't kill the life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, I could severely injure him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a single wound could tilt the balance of this fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Osborne had only intended to observe, but now he saw an opportunity. If he could land a debilitating blow on that life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, Icy Nine's group would be left vulnerable without their healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they didn't all fall, they would certainly suffer significant losses, drastically weakening the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I take the risk?" Osborne pondered for just a moment before deciding to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that letting such a prime opportunity slip away would haunt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if these Paramount Supreme Clan super warriors launched an attack on the Human Community in the West Zone, countless warriors might perish at their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's now or never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of resolve flashed in Osborne's eyes. But he didn't rush in. He waited for the perfect moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that he only had one shot at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't manage to severely injure the life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King in that single attempt, the others would undoubtedly become alert and protect him, making it nearly impossible to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to ensure his attack landed flawlessly, delivering the most powerful blow possible in one swift motion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained patient, watching intently as time dragged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle continued, resembling a war of attrition, with neither the Shadow Terror Fiend nor Icy Nine's group willing to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook with each clash, the intensity of the battle reverberating through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend, while not quite at Ascension Six, was undoubtedly formidable, and this was not even his true form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paramount Supreme Clan warriors were getting injured left and right in the fray, and the life-powered Ascension Three Supernal Deity King was increasingly overwhelmed, tirelessly healing his comrades.</span></p><div class="pagination">
