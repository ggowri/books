  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out the intel was spot on</span><span>. T</span><span>his place was indeed a Celestial Crystal Mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe his eyes when he spotted a dazzling Celestial Crystal gleaming under the sun, radiating a spectrum of colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced with excitement as he reached out and picked it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he held it, a surge of pure, immense energy flowed through him</span><span> and made </span><span>every pore in his body feel alive with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is a Celestial Crystal? The energy is incredible!" Osborne exclaimed, his voice tinged with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others gathered around, their eyes wide with curiosity and excitement as they admired the crystal in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded</span><span>. A</span><span> grin spread</span><span> </span><span>across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like the entire canyon is filled with Celestial Crystals. There are plenty just lying on the surface. Everyone, spread out and start searching! There's no danger in the canyon, but don't wander too far," he instructed, his enthusiasm infectious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cheers erupted as the group scattered, eager to hunt for more of the precious crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, kept his focus on the ground beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that more Celestial Crystals lay deep below the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Satan's Eye, he peered into the depths and saw a treasure trove of Celestial Crystals, all shimmering like gems in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Training with Celestial Crystals not only boosts our speed but also enhances our potential! The Blood Demon members have reached the peak of the Deity Overlord realm</span><span> and </span><span>exhaust</span><span>ed</span><span> all their training potential. Normally, they wouldn't be able to advance further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with these crystals, their potential can be replenished, and they might even break through to become Deity Kings! We have to mine every last one of these Celestial Crystals!" Osborne declared, determination burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly activated eight Spatial Clones to assist in the mining efforts, and together, they worked tirelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, the group reconvened, their faces alight with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member had found at least a few Celestial Crystals, and Sebastian, who also possessed a Satan's Eye</span><span>, </span><span>albeit less powerful than Osborne's</span><span>, </span><span>had managed to uncover over a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye hadn't mutated, and it was only Level Seven, far inferior to Osborne's. However, even at that level, his vision was still sharper than most others</span><span> and gave</span><span> him a significant edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He distributed the Celestial Crystals evenly among the group</span><span> and </span><span>ensur</span><span>ed </span><span>everyone received more than ten each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten Celestial Crystals are enough for most of us to advance our realms!" he said, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia chimed in, her eyes sparkling, "My Divine Body is already at Level Seven. If I break through, it'll evolve into Level Eight! But my elemental essence is still at the peak of Level Six, so I need to focus on that next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once my elemental essence hits Level Seven, I'll finally be a true Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded enthusiastically. "With these Celestial Crystals, our potential will skyrocket! Soon, our realms, Divine Bodies, and elemental essences will all meet the requirements to become Deity Kings. It's only a matter of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice brimmed with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought he'd be stuck at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm forever, but now, with the Celestial Crystals in hand, everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian genuinely believed he would soon become a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star shared in the excitement, too. Their potential had been drained, but now, with the Celestial Crystals, they could continue to climb higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan was clear</span><span>. F</span><span>irst, they would use the Celestial Crystals to break through their realms and become Quasi-Deity Kings. Then, they would work on enhancing their Divine Bodies and elemental essences to ultimately become true Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they discussed their next steps, a thought struck the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Osborne? Why hasn't he come out yet? Is he okay?" someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that they realized they had completely forgotten about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne delved deeper into the underground depths of the Celestial Crystal Mine, his unique spatial power allowed him to navigate through the tunnels with unparalleled ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne still hadn't emerged from underground after an unusually long time. Concern began to creep into their minds, and the group exchanged uneasy glances, wondering what could be keeping him down there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shimmer of vibrant colors caught his eye as he and his eight Spatial Clones scoured the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Crystals down here were far more abundant than the few they had found on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each moment spent underground only fueled Osborne's excitement. He was amassing a staggering amount of Celestial Crystals</span><span>. E</span><span>verywhere he turned, they seemed to beckon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of discovery kept him pushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Crystals, which even the geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan struggled to use, were now scattered abundantly in the depths of this underground cavern. The deeper he went, the more densely packed these crystals became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just over two hours, he had collected at least 100 thousand Celestial Crystals, and his clones had managed to gather nearly as many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, that put him close to a whopping million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is going on? Why are there so many Celestial Crystals down here?" Osborne murmured to himself, perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered such a vast collection of these precious gems before, each brimming with pure, potent energy. The thought of all that power was intoxicating</span><span>. A</span><span> million Crystals could yield an unfathomable sea of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could there be something more down here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity ignited within him. The deeper he ventured, the more Osborne wondered if there was a treasure hidden beneath the surface, something that could explain the </span><span>sheer abundance of Celestial Crystals. Determined to find out, Osborne dispatched one of his Spatial Clones further into the depths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
