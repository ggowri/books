  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, a divine artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca smiled faintly and said, "To kill you, I have to bring out the big guns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, take this axe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Luca gripped the axe with both hands, raised it high above his head, and then it burst with dark light as he swung it down at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Osborne felt the earth shake violently as if an earthquake had struck the island, sending massive waves across the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before the axe came down, Osborne sensed a force locking onto him. It felt like no matter how he tried to dodge, he couldn't escape the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt the presence of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack! What kind of divine artifact is this? It can lock onto me? It won't stop until it sees blood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned grim. He had no choice but to unleash all his strength and punch forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a violent tremor erupted. The axe carved a massive fissure through the island, like a canyon, and Osborne was sent flying. A deep wound ran from his forehead to his stomach, with blood pouring out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> was torn to shreds, with bone visible beneath the blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca looked at Osborne and smiled lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only used forty percent of my strength, and you're already struggling? Looks like you're about to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Luca raised the axe high once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, drawing in all the air from hundreds of yards around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Breath of Celestial!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his body surge with power. The fourth layer of the Breath of Celestial increased his strength by eighty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the giant axe came down again, giving him that same inescapable feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only grit his teeth and brace himself for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The axe fell once more, this time creating an even larger fissure, almost splitting the </span><span>island in half. The attack extended into the sea, causing massive waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was trembling violently, nearly split in two by the blow. The severe injuries made it difficult for him to even stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and glared at Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine artifact in Luca's hand was too powerful. Osborne could tell that Luca hadn't even used his full strength, and he already couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've disappointed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca chuckled again. "I thought this fight would be interesting, but it turned out to be boring. So, I'll send you to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca raised the axe high and brought it down again, as if he were cleaving the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne truly felt the presence of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch as the giant axe swung down toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his body wouldn't be able to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Osborne. She threw a small shield, which instantly expanded into a massive one with the image of a flaming divine bird engraved on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swallow Shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Emma!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the crucial moment, Emma finally arrived. She raised the divine artifact, the Swallow Shield, to block the axe's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the axe slammed into the Swallow Shield, making it shudder, but it didn't break. A terrifying shockwave spread out in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a powerful energy surged through the Swallow Shield and into Emma's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face flushed red, as if she had drunk too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such powerful energy. Take it back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shouted as she threw a punch. A massive force erupted, making Luca's face change as he blocked with his axe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca staggered backward, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Emma, utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma then turned to Osborne, frowning. "Are you okay? Why didn't you call us if you couldn't handle it? If I hadn't arrived in time, you'd be dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave an awkward smile in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're really strong. I was worried you guys would be in danger if you came."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew they were strong and still didn't call us? Were you just planning to get yourself killed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was speaking, Clarissa finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Osborne's battered state and the deep wounds on his body, nearly split open, her eyes immediately reddened with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly waved her hand and cast Divine Healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After casting Divine Healing three times in a row, Osborne's injuries finally started to heal significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Clarissa let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gripped Osborne's arm tightly and scolded him, "Osborne, how did you get hurt this badly? Why didn't you call us for help sooner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne awkwardly rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, Luca burst into loud laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! You finally decided to show yourselves! Now that everyone's here, I won't hold back anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, come out now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
