  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, almost everyone was focused on this battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a "performance event" of the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, many people, especially the big shots, didn't pay much attention to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To them, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was merely a contest among the younger generation, a clash below the level of Empyrean Sacredness, akin to children fighting&mdash;of course, they didn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, almost everyone was watching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Yvonne from the Royal Family had lost a match earlier. If she lost this one too, she would be eliminated and wouldn't even make it to the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, this would be an unprecedented humiliation in hundreds or even thousands of years. Whether it was the royal members, the empire's generals and officials, or people from other major powers, everyone was now waiting for the outcome of this battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difference was, some hoped Yvonne would win and restore the Royal Family's dignity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some, however, hoped Yvonne would lose, waiting to mock the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the high platform, even Frederick was watching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Telepathy, Callista smiled and said, "Darling, don't worry too much! Yvonne is still very strong. She won't make the same mistake twice. I believe she can win the match and restore our dignity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded calmly. "It better be so! To enter Necropolis City and uncover its secrets, I had them suppress their cultivation levels hundreds of years ago. Under such circumstances, their strength at the same cultivation level has already reached supreme! I even gave them countless treasures to enhance their power, granting whatever they asked for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If under such circumstances they still lose to others and disgrace the Royal Family, it only proves they're useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, a cold light flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That place can only be entered by those below Empyrean Sacredness! The stronger they are, the more likely they are to obtain the key! I hope none of the nine will disappoint me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can no longer wait for another millennium!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista nodded upon hearing this. "Trust Yvonne! After all, she's your child and has inherited your strong genes. She'll definitely be fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, however, shook his head. "Compared to our child, they are far behind Weston! And they're even further behind Lorenzo and Lilith."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista felt a surge of joy upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was praising her child!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as the queen, she couldn't show favoritism. So she simply smiled and said, "Actually, they're all the same! They're all your children, so they're equally outstanding! For example, Prince Quinn's strength is almost surpassing mine. Although he's still far behind Weston, he's already very impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista seemed to be praising Quinn, but she was actually telling Frederick that although Quinn was excellent, he was still far behind her son Weston. If Frederick were to choose an heir, Weston would be the most suitable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick did not continue the conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch the match!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne unleashed her full power. The glory and dignity of the Royal Family felt like a mountain pressing down on her shoulders, leaving her no choice but to fight with all her might.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she absolutely couldn't lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, she unleashed all her power. Not only did she wildly swing the Legendary Sacred Artifact Sword to defeat Leroy head-on, but she also activated the Legendary Sacred Artifact Bell to attack Leroy's soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was actually very dangerous for Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because right now, she could only fully wield one Legendary Sacred Artifact. Handling two artifacts at the same time was still too difficult and risky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If these artifacts lost control and backfired, she would die even if Leroy didn't make a move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Yvonne wouldn't take such a risk.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now she had to do it. Fortunately, nothing went wrong. The two Legendary Sacred Artifacts unleashed terrifying power simultaneously at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy faced two terrifying attacks simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Soul Attack was faster than the Energy Attack and harder to defend against. Just as Leroy was about to act, an incredibly clear bell sound suddenly echoed in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Leroy felt as if her mind had been struck by a heavy hammer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each bell sound was like a heavy hammer striking her head. Instantly, her expression changed. Her body swayed, almost losing balance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation immediately delighted Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers, seeing this situation, couldn't help but shake their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soul Attack is too bizarre.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Leroy can't withstand the Soul Attack, she'll instantly fall behind, or even lose outright. Yvonne can also wield two Legendary Sacred Artifacts at the same time, so it's normal for Leroy to lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the terrifying blade energy unleashed by Yvonne's sword had already reached Leroy. Leroy, seemingly affected by the soul attack, showed no reaction at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, everyone believed that Leroy couldn't possibly block Yvonne's attack and would inevitably be defeated with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the terrifying blade energy struck down, hitting Leroy's surrounding defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a Defensive Sacred Artifact, it's impossible to block such a terrifying attack with just Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Leroy's Sacred Power defense began to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her situation was extremely dangerous. Once the Sacred Power defense collapsed, the terrifying blade energy could inflict severe injuries on her, or even kill her outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro was already prepared to step in and save Leroy's life if she couldn't hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Today is the day of the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, so no one can die in this place!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Leroy finally reacted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed to quickly suppress the effects of the Soul Attack and suddenly swung the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear in her hand, unleashing an incredibly terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scorching energy erupted, instantly shattering Yvonne's blade energy. Although Leroy was blasted backward by the immense explosive force and her face turned slightly pale, she was not injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Yvonne even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She never expected Leroy to regain clarity at the critical moment and unleash an incredibly terrifying power, directly shattering her blade energy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means Leroy's power is stronger than hers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne clenched her teeth, once again activating two Legendary Sacred Artifacts to repeat her tactic, and this time she moved even faster, not wanting to give Leroy any time to react.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ding!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the Legendary Sacred Artifact Bell rang out, instantly appearing in Leroy's mind, like a heavy hammer striking her consciousness, shaking her Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Leroy seemed unaffected. Her gaze was utterly cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The same attack, trying to get me twice?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad! If it were the old me, I definitely couldn't withstand such a Soul Attack. My Soul Current Ocean might have collapsed, shattered, and I would have been seriously injured!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, I'm not afraid of such a Soul Attack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir allowed me to enter the Enlightenment State a hundred times, making my Soul Current Ocean incredibly stable and powerful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such an attack can't hurt me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Leroy suddenly made her move. The flames of the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear in her hand erupted, fiercely striking toward Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will defeat you head-on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
