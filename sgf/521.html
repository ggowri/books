  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Explosion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had once told him that his control over his powers was too coarse and only at an elementary level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The application of powers still included intermediate, advanced, and even ultimate levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intermediate application of Thunder Power was Thunder Explosion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two days, Osborne had been pondering what it was and how to create it, but unfortunately, he hadn't yet found a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, he witnessed it with his own eyes now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it was against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder Power was one of the most potent powers. Its intermediate application would naturally be even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not dare to be careless at all and instantly pulled out the Guardian Shield from the dimensional space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, his martial aura rapidly contracted, nearly adhering to his skin to protect his body and thereby boost his defensive strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when he was ready, ball lightning exploded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's vision was overwhelmed by terrifying thunder and lightning. Waves of immense power struck the Guardian Shield, causing it to flare with brilliant light, and a phantom of a grizzly bear materialized in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in just a moment, it was reduced to ashes under the attack of the Thunder Explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A charred crack instantly appeared on the Guardian Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This caused Osborne's expression to darken significantly. The Guardian Shield was one of the most formidable ancient magical weapons of the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Despite being only at level two, it was close to level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was actually cracked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This demonstrated the sheer ferocity of the Thunder Explosion. After penetrating the Guardian Shield's defense, its force diminished slightly but immediately began to assault his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the strength of Osborne's martial art aura, it couldn't withstand Owen's Thunder Explosion and began to collapse instantly. The thunder and lightning pierced through Osborne's defense and struck his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he experienced sharp pain and felt his body go numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his body had mutated and was strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even absorbed the power of the Blessing of Thunder, giving him immunity to lightning far greater than that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the thunder and lightning were absorbed by his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, Osborne still couldn't withstand the Thunder Explosion. His face turned pale, and he was blasted away with a bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the Thunder Explosion faded. Scorched, he crashed heavily a hundred yards away, creating a large crater in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sneered, "Thunder Power is my real primary power! How can you resist its intermediate form? You can be proud that you've pushed me to unleash the Thunder Explosion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn couldn't help but cheer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, I always know you are the best! You didn't take things seriously before, but now that you're putting in a bit more effort, he's really no match for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne being blown away and falling into the crater with his body charred, she just breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you offend me and slap me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you are doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie and the others were also extremely shocked. They looked at Owen with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not everyone could master the powers at the intermediate level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Newport City, only the top few among the younger generation could make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could manage to do so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen is so awesome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish I were as powerful as him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How cool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing their praises, Owen regained his composure and appeared humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, you didn't beat him to death, did you?" Evelynn suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen cast a glance at Osborne and replied calmly, "He could force me to use the Thunder Explosion, so his strength is indeed commendable. However, the Thunder Explosion is so potent that I can't even control it. If he was accidentally killed, I apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he dies, I will compensate his family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in a crater a hundred yards away, Osborne slowly got to his feet and staggered out of the crater after coughing up a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in disbelief, "How could you walk out by yourself? How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored him, yet his excitement was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is a Thunder Explosion. It doesn't seem that difficult. I've never encountered one before, so I have no idea how to perform it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I should thank Owen! He personally demonstrated the Thunder Explosion, and I felt its attack process directly. With this experience, I'll surely master the </span><span>Thunder Explosion quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his eyes on Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "It's mighty, but unfortunately, it's not enough to defeat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's expression was extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated you, but you're still doomed! Here comes another move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three bolts of ball lightning materialized in Owen's hands instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe you can resist the three Thunder Explosions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly became extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sensed Owen's strong murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen wanted to kill him!</span></p><div class="pagination">
