  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible?!" Caesar exclaimed, his face draining of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was an unprecedented situation for him. Ever since he learned the Dark Whirl of Oblivion under Lord Malevolence's guidance, he had used it against many powerful foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Dark Whirl of Oblivion was formed, the only option for his enemies was to flee in terror; they never dared to confront it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet now, Osborne merely pointed at the vortex he had created, and suddenly, he lost control over it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a situation he had never imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a scowl, Caesar summoned his soul power, desperately trying to reclaim control over the Dark Whirl of Oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his relief, the vortex began to descend once more, and a smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, Osborne chuckled, "Still trying to fight back? When it comes to dark power and soul power, I'm leagues ahead of you! What makes you think you can resist me? Turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed at the vortex again, and then, with a gentle motion of his hand, he began to rotate it as if stirring a pot. The massive vortex in the sky followed the direction of his hand, starting to spin in reverse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faster Osborne's hand moved, the quicker the black vortex spun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Scatter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a commanding shout, Osborne unleashed a powerful force, and the enormous black vortex shattered with a thunderous explosion, sending shockwaves rippling through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the Dark Whirl of Oblivion collapsed, Caesar let out a pained scream. His face turned ghostly pale, a trickle of blood escaping from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shock and disbelief filled his eyes as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually controlled my Dark Whirl of Oblivion? You shattered it? You hurt my soul?!" Caesar ground his teeth, fury radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you, that move won't work on us! Now, show me what else you've got," Osborne replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furious, Caesar shot back. "So, as the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, you have some tricks up your sleeve! But what does it matter if you've countered one of my moves? My level is higher than yours, my strength surpasses yours, and my divine artifact is far more powerful! Plus, I've got stronger teammates than you can imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you have to fight back against me? I'll crush you head-on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take down your leader, and the rest are all yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's wipe them out! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Caesar brandished the Supreme Malevolence Sword and launched a powerful strike at Osborne. The dark energy coalesced into a terrifying blade of light that zipped toward him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne countered with a punch, shattering the blade of light with ease, though he was forced to take a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What raw power! No wonder you're a late-stage Deity King!" Osborne murmured, quickly adding. "Everyone, stay alert! This is the final battle; no holding back now! Protect yourselves, and if you get the chance, take them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne charged toward Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anastasia and the others exchanged serious glances, steeling themselves as they prepared to face Tristram and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fierce battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar faced off against Osborne alone, while Tristram and his other teammates engaged in a fierce clash with Anastasia and her group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the surface, it appeared to be an uneven matchup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The average level of Caesar's team was a full tier higher than that of Osborne's group. Typically, such a disparity would lead to a swift conclusion to the battle, as they were not even in the same league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, their divine artifacts were on an entirely different level as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of Caesar's team members wielded both the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the Supreme Malevolence Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Osborne's side was equipped with just three Supreme Malevolence Swords and two Supreme Malevolence Shields, held by Bryce, Diana, and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given such a significant disparity, this battle seemed destined to be one-sided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers shared this belief, anticipating a swift victory for Caesar's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the outcome defied their expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon facing Caesar, Osborne showcased remarkable strength, holding his ground despite being at a lower level and with fewer weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The same could be said for Anastasia and her team against Tristram's group; they stood strong and even gained the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially between Caesar and Osborne, where the odds seemed stacked heavily against Osborne. Caesar, a late-stage Deity King, held a two-tier advantage over Osborne, who was only at the early stage of Deity King. Everyone believed that Caesar would quickly overpower him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, as soon as they clashed, it was Caesar who found himself on the back foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne moved like a war god, easily dodging Caesar's strikes. Despite Caesar's wielding of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he couldn't land a single hit on Osborne. Instead, with each assault, he was forced to retreat, unable to mount a defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Caesar's Supreme Malevolence Shield shattered under the relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, his resplendent outfit flared with dazzling light, effortlessly negating Osborne's powerful blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise. "What?! Is that a defensive armor? Its protective capabilities are stronger than the Supreme Malevolence Shield?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
