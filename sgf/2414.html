  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referees fell silent after hearing Gerald's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a referee whispered, "Actually, we could hide with the participants. Abyssal Planet is so vast, with our abilities, we could easily hide for a few days, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Magma Devourer is too powerful. We've worked so hard to reach this cultivation level. If I die here, I just can't accept it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald immediately looked over and said coldly, "Hide with the participants? You make it sound so easy. How do we hide? The Magma Devourer is so furious and violent, killing anyone it sees. Besides, it's clearly the master of Abyssal Planet. The native creatures on Abyssal Planet are all under its control."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, these native creatures have become aggressive and started attacking us. Moreover, judging from the Magma Devourer's movement pattern, it's hunting down the participants. No matter where they are, it can find them. If we hadn't been holding it back, many participants would already be dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's words once again silenced everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued, "I know none of you want to die. I don't want to die either. But if all the participants die here, even if we, the judges protecting them, survive, our future won't be easy. Don't forget, most of these participants come from First-rate Power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If all the participants die, do you think those from First-rate Power will let us go? We must do our best to fend off the Magma Devourer and protect the participants. Only by fulfilling our duty will the Glorious Divine Kingdom protect us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Gerald looked at the Magma Devourer and gritted his teeth, saying, "I've said everything I needed to. The Magma Devourer is going after the participants again. We must act immediately to stop it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" In the end, the judges could only agree, as they knew what kind of outcome awaited them if all the participants were killed by the Magma Devourer while they survived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill it!" The judges, led by Gerald, once again engaged in a fierce battle with the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, it wasn't a fierce battle, as the Magma Devourer had no intention of paying attention to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its targets were Dustin, Mckinley, and others hiding among the participants, as they carried the scent of the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer would only fight back in anger when it couldn't tolerate them anymore, killing a few judges before continuing to chase the participants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't very intelligent, but it had a strong obsession.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And its obsession was to kill whoever stole its Beast Soul Flower. It believed that anyone carrying the scent of the Beast Soul Flower deserved to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, most of the participants had already gathered together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what they didn't know was that doing so would only make them more dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After gathering together, they also got the scent of the Beast Soul Flower on them, becoming targets of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, they still didn't know why the Magma Devourer was so furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A participant shouted, "Run! The Magma Devourer is after us again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another roared, "Damn it! What the hell is that monster? Mr. Norton and those judges can't even stop it. Why is it chasing us? Who the hell provoked it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, deep in the desert, hundreds of participants were desperately fleeing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, they were too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the Magma Devourer, their speed was like that of snails, completely unable to shake it off. If it weren't for Gerald and the other judges risking their lives to block the Magma Devourer, they would have been caught long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was utterly terrified and panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were also in the crowd, running for their lives with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch out!" Clara suddenly exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The black iron chain in her hand swiftly shot out, entangling an Abyssal Snake that suddenly appeared beside Leroy, and strangled it to death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Abyssal Snake is a native creature of the Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They aren't very strong. Any contestant can easily deal with them when prepared. But they hide in the sand, making them hard to spot. They only launch sudden attacks when contestants get close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their most terrifying trait is their venom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once bitten by an Abyssal Snake, a person is immediately poisoned, their Sacred Power suppressed, and they completely lose the ability to move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the panic of fleeing, many contestants have already been bitten by Abyssal Snakes, collapsing on the ground after being poisoned, desperately crying for help but ignored by others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, they are fleeing in panic. Who would be willing to carry someone who can't move?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara quickly killed the Abyssal Snake near Leroy and let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also breathed a sigh of relief. "I almost got bitten by it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Leroy suddenly became serious and shouted to Clara, "Clara, watch out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy quickly acted, throwing the Inferno Drake Lance in his hand, striking a Bloody Ivy that appeared at Clara's feet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before she could relax, an Abyssal Snake suddenly sprang out from beneath the Bloody Ivy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Abyssal Snake swung its head and bit Clara's calf.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's Sacred Power defense couldn't withstand it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ouch!" Clara couldn't help but cry out. She endured the pain and killed the Abyssal Snake. Looking at the marks on her calf, her expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was bitten by the Abyssal Snake!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Clara felt the terrifying toxin enter her bloodstream, spreading throughout her body. She immediately lost control of her Sacred Power. Her body became weak and powerless, and she couldn't help but collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara!" Leroy quickly rushed over, holding Clara with a worried face. "Clara, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara bit her lower lip and said with difficulty, "I was bitten by the Abyssal Snake. I can't move now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said remorsefully, "It's all my fault. It's all my fault. If it weren't for saving me, you wouldn't have been bitten by the Abyssal Snake. Hold on. I'll get you out of here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy enveloped Clara with her Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara gave a bitter smile and said, "This has nothing to do with you, it was my own carelessness. That Abyssal Snake was hiding too well and even coordinated with the Bloody Ivy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy, don't worry about me. If you take me with you, you won't escape either. Just leave quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Leroy gritted his teeth and said, "You can't move now. If I leave, you're as good as dead. Before the Magma Devourer catches up, the surrounding Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snake can easily kill you. If I abandon you, isn't that just sending you to your death?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy set off with Clara. However, by this time, they had already fallen behind the main group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the two of them were in danger, no one paid attention to them; everyone had fled far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Leroy suddenly heard an unusual sound. She quickly looked over and saw the nearby sand dune shaking violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the sand dune exploded. Countless Bloody Ivy and Abyssal Snakes emerged from it, coldly staring at the two of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, their faces turned deathly pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're done for!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
