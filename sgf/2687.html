  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum was extremely excited at this moment, like a child who had found a fun toy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could speak, her dozens of wings started flapping. She quickly appeared in front of May, stopping above May's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, one of Drum's legs or arms forcefully pierced into May's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face changed drastically, unable to stop it in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was equally shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, don't hurt her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne only had time to shout once before seeing Drum's claw pierce into May's head. Yet, the claw seemed intangible, leaving no wound on May's head. It moved swiftly, and then a centipede-like bug was pulled out by Drum's claw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum looked even more excited after grabbing the bug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's really a Soulbane Parasite! Too bad there's only one. If there were more, I might be able to cultivate them like I did with the Ice Beetle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum held the Soulbane Parasite in his hand, constantly flipping, examining, kneading, and fiddling with it, while the Soulbane Parasite, unable to resist, could only tremble in fear in Drum's grasp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Soulbane Parasite felt a suppression deep within its soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left it completely unable to resist Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It really worked!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing the Soulbane Parasite being handled by Drum, Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum can really suppress the Soulbane Parasite!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this is quite normal. The Soulbane Parasites were originally Empress Kira's subordinates, a sharp blade in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira controlled the Soulbane Parasites to infest the supreme warriors of other races and unleashed them at critical moments, winning the Cosmic Ultimatum Battle and becoming the cosmos's first absolute master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira naturally had ways to counter, deal with, or suppress the Soulbane Parasites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, why would the Soulbane Parasites obey Empress Kira's orders?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Drum, as Empress Kira's daughter, can naturally counter and suppress the Soulbane Parasites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The current situation has already proven Osborne's suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum effortlessly pulled out the Soulbane Parasite lurking deep in May's Soul Current Ocean without harming May in the slightest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May was saved!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just needs some rest to fully recover, at most losing a bit of memory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is already very good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May's eyes turned blank but quickly returned to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened to me? Why am I here? Is this the Fairy Moon Sect? When did I come back? Ms. Alba, did you save me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May looked at Adriana in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was extremely excited at this moment. "May, you're okay? That's great! Truly great!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May said in surprise, "Ms. Alba, what exactly happened? I only remember being on the Ancient Battlefield in the Skyfall Casket. Suddenly, an emperor fruit flew over, and I sensed an incredibly rich spiritual power. Drawn by the spiritual power, I entered an extremely terrifying forest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that forest, there were so many bugs that couldn't be killed! We tried to escape, but the forest came alive and blocked us, then the branches pierced through my body. I passed out after that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, was it you who saved me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing that May had indeed recovered, Adriana cried with joy and quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It wasn't me who saved you, it was Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time Adriana finished speaking, May's eyes were wide open. She stared at the Soulbane Parasite in Drum's hand, which looked like a centipede, with fear in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's this kind of bug!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They can actually parasitize in our Soul Current Ocean!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also looking at the Soulbane Parasite at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "It seems that May isn't the only one parasitized by Soulbane Parasites! Among everyone who came out of the Skyfall Casket, aside from Emperor Frederick and Queen Callista, the others are likely already parasitized and controlled by Soulbane Parasites!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and all those from the major forces have all been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Adriana's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone who entered that forest must have been parasitized by Soulbane Parasites! But their lives have nothing to do with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Adriana, it might not matter, she might even be pleased with such a situation, but for Osborne, it's a whole different story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne even felt a bit relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relieved that those people were only parasitized by Soulbane Parasites, rather than dying directly in the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to take revenge on them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, as long as the Soulbane Parasites parasitizing their Soul Current Ocean are removed, they will regain consciousness like May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne can take his revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Drum wants more Soulbane Parasites to cultivate Soulbane Parasites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne must find all those people and capture all the Soulbane Parasites parasitizing their Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those who have no grudge against him must be treated the same because these Soulbane Parasites are too dangerous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If these Soulbane Parasites are left unchecked, who knows whose Soul Current Ocean they might parasitize. Perhaps accidentally, they could parasitize his Soul Current Ocean, suppress his consciousness, devour his memories, and take control of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, with no one controlling these Soulbane Parasites, they are an extremely dangerous bomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They must all be captured and handed over to Drum to control them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then will it be safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, ask this Soulbane Parasite why they are inside the Skyfall Casket? Weren't the Soulbane Parasites in the universe supposed to be extinct long ago?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded upon hearing this and quickly started communicating with the Soulbane Parasite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It says it doesn't know either!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was born inside the Skyfall Casket and has never encountered other living beings, unable to leave the Skyfall Casket. Its ancestors were likely sealed inside the Skyfall Casket by someone, and they just wanted to escape. That's why they lured those people into the jungle and parasitized their Soul Current Ocean."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sealed inside the Skyfall Casket by someone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know the origin of the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the only certainty is that it definitely hides many secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne will definitely go to Necropolis City again, and will also enter the Skyfall Casket, perhaps encountering the Soulbane Parasites inside the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Soulbane Parasites' method of parasitizing in the Soul Current Ocean is too cunning, so Osborne doesn't know when he might be controlled by these bugs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he asked, "Drum, do you have any way to prevent me from being parasitized by the Soulbane Parasites?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum tilted his head, thought for a moment, and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Simple! As long as I leave a trace of my aura in your Soul Current Ocean, the Soulbane Parasites absolutely won't be able to parasitize you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Drum waved his paw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, a barely noticeable aura merged into Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. Osborne didn't feel any changes in his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew that Drum wouldn't lie to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Then leave a trace of your aura in this lady's Soul Current Ocean too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum didn't hesitate and waved his hand again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt relieved. Next, he would have Drum leave traces of his aura in the Soul Current Ocean of Isa, Clarissa, and others to prevent them from being parasitized by Soulbane Parasites.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even his relatives and friends far away on Celestara Planet must do the same!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had a feeling... Osborne had a feeling that these Soulbane Parasites escaping from the Skyfall Casket this time would cause a massive disaster on the Racial Convergence Planet, and even in the surrounding star clusters!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If preparations aren't made early, big problems might arise!</span></p><div class="pagination">
