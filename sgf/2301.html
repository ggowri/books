  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "Damn, this place is brutal. I seriously doubt I could survive here with just my Sacred Power and the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow if I didn't have the Ascending Sacred Sanctum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden wave of doubt washed over him.</span><br><span>Did Agatha really make it to the seventh layer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If she did, how in the world is she surviving in this environment? Could she actually find the Frost-kissed Heart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Would that make her stronger than me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She probably has a few tricks up her sleeve. I mean, if I can roll around in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, why couldn't she have a Sacred Artifact of similar caliber? She is a super-genius from the Ember Phoenix Clan, after all...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slammed the brakes on that train of thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum was chugging Sacred Crystals like water, at least 50 thousand a day, he estimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's highway robbery!</span><br><span>Even with his recent winnings, Osborne felt the sting of that kind of expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time to find that Frost-kissed Heart, and pronto! Otherwise, this whole trip will be a total bust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a renewed focus, his gaze locked onto the colossal snow mountain in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was wide open, and a scan with Satan's Eye revealed nothing of interest. The only thing that stood out was the mountain itself, its peak shrouded in swirling clouds that even Satan's Eye couldn't pierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That mountain's definitely hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this is really the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer, and if the Frost-kissed Heart is actually real, then it's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be on that mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed resolve hardening his gaze, Osborne began his trek toward the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, surprise flickered across Osborne's face. In the snow, he spotted faint footprints, not yet completely buried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from the footprint size, it appeared to be a </span><span>woman's</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Agatha! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really did make it to the seventh layer! And she's beelining straight for that mountain! Looks like she's already climbing, maybe even past those clouds. Otherwise, Satan's Eye would have picked her up by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a beat of hesitation, Osborne decided to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew next to nothing about Frost-kissed Hearts or the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer, but Agatha clearly came prepared. Following her breadcrumb trail would be the most efficient way to snag the treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with Satan's Eye, he was confident she wouldn't even know he was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Osborne set off, tailing Agatha's tracks toward the looming snow mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each step sank into the soft snow, sending a bone-chilling cold creeping up his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's constant protection, he'd be a popsicle by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Sanctum's defenses, Osborne felt the creeping cold nipping at him, his blood threatening to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The environment was so brutal that flight was out of the question; he was forced to trudge on, step by agonizing step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne reached the base of the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of the mountain became even more apparent here. Standing at its foot, Osborne felt as insignificant as an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air grew palpably colder, and he noticed the Ascending Sacred Sanctum burning through Sacred Crystals at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more alarming, Osborne could hear faint crackling sounds emanating from the Sanctum's defensive barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grim expression settled on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it. Is the Ascending Sacred Sanctum </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gonna</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> fail me here? It's only got thirty percent of its defense runes left... Still, I've come this far. I have to see what's up there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, Osborne planted his foot on the mountainside and began his ascent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, an even more terrifying chill shot up from Osborne's feet, sending shivers through his body and stiffening his muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, that's cold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confirming that the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was holding its own, Osborne pressed onward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued his climb, encountering no immediate problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the dangers were ever-present, simply held at bay by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, Osborne felt relatively at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye continued its scan, searching for anything worthwhile. Alas, nothing turned up, not even Agatha's footprints, which vanished the moment she stepped onto the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't worried. Just knowing Agatha had climbed the mountain was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain was vast; running into her wouldn't be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About an hour later, Osborne reached the mountain's halfway point. Ahead lay a bank of fog so thick one could cut it with a knife. Even Satan's Eye couldn't penetrate what lay beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fog was made up of countless tiny water droplets, each radiating an intense, bone-chilling cold far more potent than the frigid winds swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne first replenished the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's energy core with 100 thousand Sacred Crystals before stepping into the mist. Immediately, the Sanctum's defensive barrier emitted a series of crackling sounds, as if it were about to freeze and shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My own strength is still lacking! I can't fully unlock the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's power! Otherwise, this level of cold shouldn't be putting so much strain on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Good thing the Sanctum has an energy core and can be powered by Sacred Crystals! If I had to rely solely on my own Sacred Power, I might not be able to withstand this terrifying cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne stepped fully into the fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the fog began to thin around him, allowing Satan's Eye to see a considerable distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of excitement coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His primary mission on the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer was to find the Frost-kissed Heart, and Satan's Eye was his greatest weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the fog rendered Satan's Eye useless, finding the Frost-kissed Heart on this colossal mountain would be like finding a needle in a haystack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, time was ticking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state duel only lasted seven days. A day and change had already passed, and on the final day, everyone had to haul their butts back to the first layer to compete for points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That left Osborne with just over four days to explore and search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he could visually scour this entire mountain in such a short time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Satan's Eye functioning, the game had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is a Frost-kissed Heart, anyway..." Osborne muttered as Satan's Eye continued its scan, searching for any anomalies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, he found </span><span>nothing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Then I'll keep climbing! The higher I go, the more intense the cold, and the more likely I am to find a Frost-kissed Heart!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then resumed his ascent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a day passed in this manner, Satan's Eye constantly scanning, leaving Osborne feeling dog-tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he found absolutely nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum has already burned through over 50 thousand Sacred Crystals! And for what? If I have to leave empty-handed, it'll be a huge loss!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a glint of light caught his eye, as if something had reflected the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped his gaze toward the source and saw something sparkling in the distance, and a look of excitement spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is that a Frost-kissed Heart?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
