  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buried deep beneath the earth, the root loomed immense, with its widest point stretching over hundreds of yards in diameter and a length reaching tens of thousands of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Extracting it would be an insurmountable challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the rocks and soil on Divine Peak Nine were enveloped in a layer of special energy, making it nearly impossible for even a Deity King to stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the face of Osborne's spatial power, it was merely a walk in the park. He could easily peel the root away from the rock and soil, storing it in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his space elemental essence having reached Level Seven, his Dimensional Space was incredibly stable and vast</span><span>. H</span><span>e could fit an entire mountain with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident that everything would go smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as his Spatial Clone used spatial energy to extract the root and pull it into the Dimensional Space, an unexpected incident unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground began to tremble violently, and a chilling aura surged near the Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a shadow</span><span>, </span><span>a bizarre, black figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stood before the Spatial Clone, its features hidden in darkness, but the Clone could feel those invisible eyes boring into it with an unsettling focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the shadow lingered, the surrounding space warped, and the earth roared in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in an instant, a terrifying killing intent erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the shadow sprang into action, extending a colossal arm to strike down upon the Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's consciousness resonated with that of the Clone; instead of succumbing to panic, it swiftly activated its spatial power and slipped into parallel space, attempting to escape through Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was self-assured. After all, not even a Deity King could stop his escape with such powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment brought devastation. The eerie shadow's arm pierced through the fabric of space, following the Spatial Clone into the parallel realm, then delivered a crushing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An explosion echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Clone shattered, obliterated as if struck down with a hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Osborne's true self was left in shock, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, his voice rising in alarm, "What the hell?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is that thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned grave. "Could it really be</span><span> </span><span>the legendary Shadow Terror Fiend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana had warned him of a strange and fearsome Shadow Terror Fiend lurking atop the divine peak, a creature so terrifying that nearly every soul who encountered it had met their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Lord Malevolence had survived the encounter, and even he emerged gravely wounded, too terrified afterward to approach the divine peak again, relying instead on his Dark Deity Legion for exploration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's definitely the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No doubt about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's as powerful as they say! It crushed my Spatial Clone like squashing a mosquito! Even in parallel space, it was able to wipe it out with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the impending threat of death, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to flee without a second thought. But then his expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that the Shadow Terror Fiend was pursuing him, weaving through the rocks with the ease of a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It moved with an unsettling grace, yet Osborne could feel its murderous intent creeping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's trying to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened as he picked up the pace, racing toward the surface while ordering his Spatial Clones to intercept the relentless Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, the Shadow Terror Fiend struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its arm came down with casual ease, obliterating Osborne's second Spatial Clone in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like trying to stop a tsunami with a twig</span><span>, </span><span>utterly futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Osborne's Clones were smashed to smithereens, their efforts barely slowing the merciless advance of the shadowy creature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation clawed at Osborne's insides. His face was a picture of intensity as he gritted his teeth and surged upward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, above ground, Sebastian, Anastasia, and the others were anxiously waiting for Osborne's return. The tremors had only heightened their concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then</span><span>, </span><span>like a bolt from the blue</span><span>, </span><span>Osborne burst onto the scene, wild-eyed and gasping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..." Anastasia started, an eager smile blooming on her face as she rushed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could reach him, Osborne shouted, "Everyone, get into the Dimensional Microcosm right now! The Shadow Terror Fiend has appeared! Move, move, move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others exchanged fearful glances, the panic in Osborne's voice sending a shockwave through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Terror Fiend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's face went ashen as she realized the severity of their plight. She had heard the horror stories, and they were all too real now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, they activated the portal to the Dimensional Microcosm and hurried inside, hearts pounding in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they vanished from view, a wave of relief washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dimensional Microcosm is protected by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of </span><span>Eternity. It should hold! No matter what happens, the Primordial Crimson Lotus must safeguard the Microcosm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination fueling his flight, Osborne pushed himself to escape the canyon, adrenaline coursing through his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he sprinted forward, a chilling realization hit him</span><span>. H</span><span>e felt his last Spatial Clone shatter into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend was closing in on him now, its sinister presence relentless and inescapable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
