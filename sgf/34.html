  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Idiot, are you out of your mind?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s not over just because you say so? Who do you think you are? And if I recall, you&rsquo;re out of money, right? Even if the auction wasn&rsquo;t over, what could you possibly have to compete with me? You really are an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, &ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m out of money?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face was disdainful. &ldquo;Ophelia and I have accounted for every penny you have.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Osborne glanced at Ophelia and said calmly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I was out of money, but thanks to you both, I&rsquo;m not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley frowned. &ldquo;What do you mean by that, you loser?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne replied nonchalantly, &ldquo;I just stepped out to use the restroom.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;Did you run off there to borrow money?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head. &ldquo;Of course not. I merely asked Ms. Lewis to add an extra item to the auction at the last minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, and that item? It&rsquo;s the pistol you just bought for sixty million and ten thousand dollars. So, I must thank you for that. Thanks to you, I have 60 million dollars more in my pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, and guess how much I initially bought that pistol for? Just 300 thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Tsk tsk, a pistol I bought for 300 thousand dollars was just bought by you for 60 million dollars. I&rsquo;ve made a 200-fold profit. I almost feel guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, you are truly my benefactor!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;So now that I have 60 million dollars again, how do you think I should spend it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne finished with a playful tone, and suddenly, silence fell over the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s smile froze as he stared at Osborne in disbelief. It was as if thunder was roaring in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long pause, his mouth twitched slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said with a displeased expression, &ldquo;What did you just say? You consigned that pistol to Draco Auction House? That&rsquo;s impossible. You can&rsquo;t fool me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled but offered no explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Debbe approached. &ldquo;Mr. Augustine is right. The mini-handgun was indeed consigned to us by Mr. Augustine just moments ago. As a VIP client, he has the right to request the auction house to add items to the auction at the last minute.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Debbe finished speaking, the room erupted into a buzz of chatter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No, this loser just got lucky and received a VIP experience card. He&rsquo;s not a real VIP,&rdquo; Wesley exclaimed in agitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe smiled faintly, &ldquo;A temporary VIP with an experience card is still a VIP. Mr. Augustine is entitled to all the privileges of being a VIP.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t just a temporary VIP.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He owned the prestigious Draco Star Wristlet, a status far superior to that of an ordinary VIP.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Debbe wasn&rsquo;t going to share this detail with Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Wesley as if he were a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was utterly stunned. He finally realized the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No wonder Osborne had been goading him into spending money. The last auction item was Osborne&rsquo;s, added to the auction at the last minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne knew that Wesley wouldn&rsquo;t accept losing the bet and would spend a fortune to win the final auction item.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, Osborne set a trap, arranging for his own item to be the last one in the auction and waiting for Wesley to bid wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley spent 60 million dollars on the Draco Model H mini-handgun, which went into Osborne&rsquo;s account, but Osborne had only paid 300 thousand dollars for it. That was a net profit of 59 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s eyes turned red with fury. &ldquo;You bastard! You tricked me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne replied coldly, &ldquo;So what if I did? You&rsquo;re such a fool. Who else was I supposed to trick? You have only yourself to blame for being both stupid and rich.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s blood boiled at his words. He clenched his fists tightly, his breathing becoming rapid as if he was about to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at him with disdain. &ldquo;Do you dare?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley calmed down instantly, gritting his teeth. &ldquo;You bastard, I still won the bet even if the last auction item was yours. You still have to submit to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Wesley as if he were an idiot and said calmly, &ldquo;You really are dumb. Ms. Lewis already said I&rsquo;m a VIP. I can add items to the auction at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;So now, I&rsquo;ll add another item to the auction, another Draco Model H mini-handgun and the auction will continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, would you like to bid again? How about another 60 million dollars to buy it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll buy it myself, which means I&rsquo;ll have spent more money in the auction than you. And that means I win the bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The one who should admit defeat and submit to me is you.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
