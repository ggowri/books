  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auction wrapped up, representatives from various factions made their way backstage to finalize their transactions and collect the slaves they had purchased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, their haul was far less than they had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the human slaves had been bought by Osborne alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this level of auction, opportunities were rare, and the slaves available were top-tier. With most of them now in Osborne's possession, the others couldn't help but feel a sting of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Zion from the Rainbow Viper Clan glared at Osborne with icy contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as Tiana personally handed Osborne a Super VIP badge, a mix of envy and fury swirling in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion mused, "Hmph, what's there to gloat about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if you're now a Super VIP at the slave market, you won't last long! You've crossed the Deity Overlord warrior, Fabian, and no amount of status will save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's probably lurking outside the slave market, waiting for you to step out. Once you do, you're as good as dead! You won't even need the Margery family to handle you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Zion collected the slave he had bought and made his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't leave just yet; he wanted to see Osborne meet his demise at Fabian's hands, to witness the moment he was reduced to nothing more than a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other factions, too, lingered after leaving the slave market, their hearts set on seeing Osborne brought down by Fabian. They were eager to see Osborne get what was coming to him after he had overshadowed them at the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the backstage area was left with only Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, please take good care of this Super VIP badge. With it, most people won't dare to make a move against you. Of course, if it's someone like Fabian, well, that's another story. So, do be cautious," Tiana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I understand. Now, let's go collect my slaves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right this way," Tiana replied, leading him through the corridors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaves available at the auction were all exceptional in terms of strength, talent, and beauty, securely held in specially designed cages. These cages were incredibly sturdy, fortified with powerful divine power locks. Even a Celestial Deity warrior would find it impossible to break free from these divine restraints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, their limbs were bound with divine artifact chains crafted by the Artisan Institute, which suppressed their divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once shackled, their abilities would be reduced to a mere one percent of their true potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a state, even a Celestial Deity warrior would be no more than an ordinary Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived first at the cage holding three exquisite female slaves from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was a Celestial Deity warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent a staggering 50 million Essence Crystals to secure their freedom, a decision that had put him at odds with the Deity Overlord warrior, Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne felt it was worth every penny. Their bodies, appearances, and talents were top-notch, and he couldn't bear the thought of them falling into Fabian's hands, destined to become his breeding machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing outside the cage, Osborne locked eyes with the three female slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared back at him, their expressions a mix of gratitude and apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had witnessed the lengths he went to at the auction, risking his standing to save them from a fate worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Osborne, they knew they would have been sold to Fabian, forced to endure his unwanted advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being at the mercy of the grotesque warrior made them shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the idea of being under the control of Osborne, a fellow Human Community member, was at least somewhat comforting, even if it was still a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the reality of their situation weighed heavily on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were now slaves, and the thought of being owned by a master left them feeling hollow. They couldn't muster a warm reception for Osborne, their expressions reflecting their inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unfazed, offering the three women a soft smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Tiana Hart, could you please unlock the cage and let them out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's expression turned serious. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, are you sure about this? These women are Celestial Deity warriors. Even with their divine powers suppressed down to one percent, they're still as powerful as any Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They haven't been trained or tamed yet. Are you certain you want to just open the cage like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded calmly. "It's fine! In fact, not only do I want you to open the cage, but I also want the chains binding their hands and feet unlocked! And please, let's cancel their slave registrations and restore their identities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's jaw dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mr. Lachlan Swift, did I hear you correctly? You want to remove their chains and cancel their slave status, just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spent 50 million Essence Crystals to buy them, risking the wrath of Deity Overlord Fabian, and now you want to set them free?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disbelief in her eyes was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women in the cage exchanged stunned glances, struggling to comprehend Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought they must have misheard him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
