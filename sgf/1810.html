  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's furious roar echoed. In his mind, he couldn't fathom how Osborne had pulled off such a trick. He could only assume that the Osborne they had killed earlier was just a mere projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth was far more astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't killed a mere illusion; they had obliterated Osborne's true form. What they didn't realize was that with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;now fused to the eighth level&mdash;Osborne could resurrect even if his Divine Body was completely shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could choose to revive anywhere within a radius of over 6000 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had orchestrated this moment, deliberately putting himself in harm's way to exploit his resurrection ability and slip out of their grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have chosen to resurrect farther away, where Hubery and his crew wouldn't have a clue he was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he resurrected close enough to taunt them, letting them see him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of murderous intent flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sneaking away quietly? That had never crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he had something far bolder in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After provoking Hubery and the others, he turned on his heel and sprinted deeper into Divine Peak Nine, the mist swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, consumed by rage, led a pack of late-stage Deity Kings hot on Osborne's heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After him! He's still within the range of the Supreme Origin Colossus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't use interdimensional travel, and at his speed, there's no way he can escape us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we catch him, he's as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Deity Kings above, follow me! I want to see him die with my own eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was a thunderclap of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five hundred Deity Kings surged into Divine Peak Nine, leaving the weaker warriors behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew the dangers that lurked within; without Deity King's strength, survival was nearly impossible in this treacherous terrain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they wouldn't be able to keep pace with Osborne anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for chasing him with the Malevolence Airships?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was out of the question. Everyone knew that flying those ships inside Divine Peak would attract the dreaded Shadow Terror Fiends&mdash;creatures so powerful that even Lord Malevolence would think twice before facing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, only the elite cadre of over five hundred Deity Kings plunged into the depths of Divine Peak Nine, relentlessly pursuing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peak itself was colossal, shrouded in thick fog that obscured vision and dulled senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such conditions, even Hubery, at the pinnacle of the Deity King level, had to push himself to the limit just to keep up with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery bellowed, his voice echoing ominously, "Damn it! You better not let me catch you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do, I'll skin you alive and make you suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, "Oh, old man, you think you can flay me? You'll have to catch me first! Honestly, your speed is like that of a snail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's blood boiled at the insult. "You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of fury, he accelerated, closing the gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he was right behind Osborne, launching a furious barrage of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's laughter rang out, a mix of triumph and madness as he finally managed to corner Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face lit up with glee as the other Deity Kings caught up, ready to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five hundred Deity King warriors once again surrounded Osborne, each wearing a cold smirk on their face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery sneered. "Run, coward! Why aren't you running now?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly human, you were so arrogant a moment ago. Why aren't you fleeing now? Come on, try to escape! Do you think you can escape from my grasp?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old man, do you really think it's you who caught up to me? I was simply waiting for you," he stated nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face darkened at this remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retorted harshly, "What do you mean? Did you wait for me on purpose? Hahaha! On your deathbed, you still have the nerve to talk tough? You're not an idiot; you should be fleeing for your life instead of waiting here to die. Are you suicidal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery looked down on Osborne with disdain, not believing his words for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again, calmly saying, "Of course, I'm not here to die willingly. I just thought it would be quite satisfactory to eliminate all of you right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, everyone fell silent, staring at Osborne as if he were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were filled with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminate us here? You pathetic human, on what grounds? We have five hundred Deity King warriors here! We could drown you with our spits. Yet, you have the audacity to say you'll eliminate us? Don't you find that amusing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face was overflowing with disdain. He was about to order an assault to finish Osborne off, fearing that delaying would only create more problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne smiled once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see. Blood Demon members, come forth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Undead Cataclysm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reveal yourselves!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
