They pretended not to notice, biding their time until the trio was close enough to unleash a devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely the scenario Osborne had orchestrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was a risky move, he needed to keep his intentions subtle; otherwise, suspicions would arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the God of Light was in a state of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recognized the trio for what they were&mdash;Osborne's disguises&mdash;and understood that his goal was to "sacrifice" himself. He needed her to play along in this dangerous charade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy One prepared to strike, she had to hold back, ensuring that </span><span>s</span><span>he didn't try to save Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she intervened with her formidable power, it would be nearly impossible for Icy One and his crew to finish the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, anxiety gnawing at her, "This is too risky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he really think he won't be killed by Icy One? What kind of trick does he have up his sleeve to ensure he comes out alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of internal struggle, she resolved to follow Osborne's lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze away, feigning ignorance of the unfolding drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne survived, the Paramount Supreme Clan would have no hope of winning the competition, and a full-scale war would erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of millions of Human Community warriors would perish on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope this plan works and that he can truly deceive Icy One, buying us time before the inevitable war begins..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her mind made up, the God of Light intensified her attacks, focusing on Icy One and his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Icy One and his crew maintained their facade of battling the God of Light, but their attention was laser-focused on the advancing trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One said, "Everyone, get ready!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to strike decisively&mdash;no hesitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our priority is to take down Osborne! Icy Four, Icy Five, you two hold the God of Light at bay. If she tries to intervene, you must stop her, even if it's just for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all we need to finish Osborne! It looks like the God of Light hasn't caught on yet, but stay sharp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Six and the others are likely already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how Osborne managed to take down Icy Six, but it's clear he has the means to threaten an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not let our guard down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's eyes gleamed with cold determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, Icy Six is finished! If we don't eliminate Osborne, we'll be in deep trouble. I can't even imagine how to explain this to the esteemed Lord Malevolence. If Osborne survives, we'll have no choice but to launch an all-out assault on Peaks City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now... Osborne, it's time for you to meet your end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing you will make Icy Six, Seven, and Eight's sacrifice worthwhile!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished his thoughts, he saw Osborne and his companions draw closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his voice thundered in Icy Two and the others' minds. "Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-prepared Divine Ascendance Techniques erupted in a synchronized burst of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One, Icy Two, and Icy Three, the three strongest Dark Sovereigns, had been facing the God of Light just moments before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they spun around, unleashing a fierce assault that engulfed Osborne, Diana, and Bryce in a wave of terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and panic washed over the faces of the three as the onslaught descended upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no mere disguise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio was genuinely taken aback by the sheer ferocity of the attack. Earlier, they had witnessed the five of them struggling against the God of Light, barely managing to hold her at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thought the so-called Dark Sovereigns were overrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, faced with their onslaught, Osborne finally grasped their true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How foolish I was to worry about Icy One's ability to actually 'kill' me! The strength of an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King is far beyond anything I can contend with now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I unleash everything I've got, I'm no match for Icy One. I'm not even on the same playing field! I'm leagues behind a real warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he felt the weight of his predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he quickly summoned his divine power, erecting a defensive barrier around himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, the attack struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Bryce barely had time to react before they were obliterated by the overwhelming force. Their Divine Bodies, though formidable at level ten, were no match for such an onslaught, given their cultivation level of only Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only </span><span>Osborne was left to fend for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power shield was crumbling under the relentless assault, but he wasn't dead yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had to keep up the act. With rage bubbling beneath the surface, Osborne shouted in a voice that mimicked Icy Six, "Icy One, what the hell are you doing? Why are you attacking us? Have you lost your mind? Stop this at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!" Icy One laughed derisively, his face twisted in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't play games with me! You think this little charade can fool me? It's laughable! We've known who you are </span><span>long ago</span><span>! You're such a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his mocking words, Icy One didn't let up; his attacks intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll hand it to you&mdash;you've lasted longer than I expected! But no matter how talented you are, it all leads to the same end&mdash;your death! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A more terrifying wave of energy crashed down upon Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power defenses shattered completely, and his Infinite Sacred Body began to show horrific wounds, crumbling before the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of sheer terror, Osborne cried out, "God of Light, help me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light gritted her teeth, torn between her instincts and the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's desperate plea echoed in her mind, she heard his calm voice cutting through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, don't actually save me! Just pretend! Once I'm 'killed,' make sure your fury is palpable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, caught in a whirlwind of conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she decided to follow Osborne's instructions. She feigned a frantic charge toward him, as if trying to rescue him, but Icy Four and Icy Five blocked her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her strength, she could have easily overpowered them and reached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, her anxiety led to a critical mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She missed the perfect moment to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's Infinite Sacred Body finally gave way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless barrage from Icy One, Icy Two, and Icy Three, he could no longer withstand the assault. His body shattered completely, exploding into nothingness in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a boom, Osborne was "dead".</span></p><div class="pagination">
