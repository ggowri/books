  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did we pass the seventeenth level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When they entered the eighteenth level, Clara, Leroy, and Casey still looked utterly amazed, feeling as if they were dreaming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is already the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Frederick's ultimate goal. He spent countless years just trying to find a way to obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Caskets on the eighteenth level of the Celestial Spire."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On Racial Convergence Planet, everyone knows that the twelve top warriors of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet once teamed up to enter the Celestial Spire, but they only reached the seventeenth level and ultimately failed to pass it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In contrast, the four of them have successfully passed the seventeenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"More precisely, Osborne easily passed the test of the seventeenth level alone, while the other three seemed like mere spectators, simply being led through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This seemed too easy for them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, in reality, it was not easy at all. In the test of the seventeenth level, fifty out of the one hundred warriors' projections had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could someone who just broke through Empyrean Sacredness handle warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only people like Seraphina, Emiliano, or Clara, Leroy could handle warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness right after breaking through Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, even for them, it's tough to handle too many advanced Empyrean Sacredness at once."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the test of the seventeenth level was actually very challenging."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, Osborne's strength was too overwhelming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In front of Osborne, those warriors' projections at advanced Empyrean Sacredness seemed no different from those who broke through primary or mid Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, he could pierce them with just one arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, looking at Osborne's back, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were filled with shock."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, just how strong are you now?" Clara finally couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and stopped using the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide his energy and cultivation level. In an instant, the energy of advanced Empyrean Sacredness spread out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Yes! Actually, I&rsquo;ve already surpassed advanced Empyrean Sacredness. Princess Seraphina, Prince Emiliano, and the royal princes and princesses can suppress their cultivation level while temporarily storing their power. Once they break through Empyrean Sacredness, they will directly advance to mid Empyrean Sacredness. Actually, I can do that too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the power I&rsquo;ve stored will be greater than theirs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, after breaking through Empyrean Sacredness, my cultivation level directly reached the peak of advanced Empyrean Sacredness, not far from Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clara, Leroy, and Casey took a deep breath again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not far from breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at each other, completely shocked by Osborne. They finally understood why he could easily lead the three of them through and reach the eighteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As early as the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Osborne had already proven his unrivaled cultivation level and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Osborne has reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and he's even close to Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. How could ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projections possibly compare to Osborne?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, they would be easily obliterated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're really so lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey smiled helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought they were already quite strong, but compared to Osborne, they felt so weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and once again concealed his energy with the Sublime Concealment Orb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you know about this, don't tell anyone else. Although we might not be able to keep it hidden for long, hiding it for a while isn't bad," Osborne told Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey nodded firmly and said, "Don't worry. We won't tell anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Let's quickly head to the trial area."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've already reached the eighteenth level. As long as we pass, we can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket. Plus, the battle points we earn can be exchanged for treasures to enhance our strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne began searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the fifteenth level, Seraphina and the others still hadn't found the trial area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Seraphina feel very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't have much time left. Outside the Celestial Spire, Frederick and the others were still anxiously waiting for her and the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every three days, the concentration of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance outside would increase, and so would everyone's danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick had said they only had six days, at most no more than nine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, the concentration of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance outside would kill most people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's the second day now. The third day is coming soon..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina murmured, "We definitely have enough time, but let's hurry a bit. We must split up; that way, we'll search more efficiently."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina began organizing everyone to act separately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, good news finally came. Someone had found the trial area on the fifteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, everyone gathered there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when they entered the light beam and found that all one hundred warriors' projections on the other side had already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, many took a deep breath, their eyes filled with unease and panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all warriors who had reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these fifty-six people, only Seraphina, Emiliano, and other royal princes and princesses had reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others had just broken through primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On average, each person had to face almost two warriors, and they had already lost confidence. Let alone defeating these warriors, they couldn't even hold out for long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Seraphina's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She finally took out her Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Blackstar Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, listen up!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the battle begins, some of you need to use Defensive Sacred Artifacts to block attacks and buy time for others. There are only a hundred warriors there. As long as we work together seamlessly, we can easily get through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Everyone nodded in response.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the battle began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina took out her Supreme Sacred Artifact, Blackstar Bow, showcasing immense power. She easily defeated the warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emiliano, Matthew, and others also quickly defeated those warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others found it difficult; they couldn't even defend against those warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, one person unfortunately faced attacks from three warriors' projections at once. Even using Defensive Sacred Artifacts, he couldn't withstand it. As his defense shattered, his body was torn apart and dissolved into light before everyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone was eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first person eliminated from their team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina looked displeased. They were only at the fifteenth level of the trial, with even harder challenges ahead on the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even eighteenth levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone gets eliminated now, can they really make it through the eighteenth level?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina muttered under her breath and shouted, "Everyone, come here! Stop attacking. Focus only on defense, block the attacks for us six, and protect us. We'll take down these warriors' projections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone quickly moved after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, as they focused on defense without attacking, they finally felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they finally defeated all the warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They took more than a hundred breaths, so each of them only received the minimum reward.</span></p><div class="pagination">
