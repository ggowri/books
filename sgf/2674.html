  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly led them away from here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't in a good mood at the moment. Because Weston, Quinn, and Naomi all died in that forest, Osborne had no way to avenge them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who does that forest belong to? And why did he do that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial couldn't be sure either. The only thing he could confirm was that the owner of that forest must be a big shot. Nearly forty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't resist and were all consumed by the forest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was glad he listened to Primordial and didn't enter the forest, even stopping them in the process. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that the Skyfall Casket was becoming more and more mysterious. Here, not only could one gain opportunities and quickly enhance their strength, but there were also unimaginable dangers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire Ancient Battlefield was incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wonder where Adriana went? Luckily, Adriana didn't enter that forest... But May did and got her body pierced by branches! Adriana will probably be very upset when she finds out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, May is one of the deputy leaders of the Fairy Moon Sect. Losing May greatly weakens the Fairy Moon Sect's strength! However, the Royal Family's loss is even greater..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Except for Frederick and Callista, all the Royal Family's warriors were swallowed by that forest!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go find Adriana first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that without the astral projection on the Ancient Battlefield, there was no danger anymore. As long as he stayed away from that forest, he should be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began searching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still couldn't understand why Frederick and Adriana didn't enter that forest. Didn't they sense the spiritual energy emanating from it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they sensed it, they would definitely be curious and go check it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be... they are not on this Ancient Battlefield?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of a possibility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Ancient Battlefield was vast, but without any danger, Osborne managed to search the entire area in just two days with his speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't see Adriana, nor did he see Frederick or Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;&#30475;&#26469;&#20182;&#20204;&#30495;&#30340;&#19981;&#22312;&#36825;&#29255;Ancient Battlefield&#19978;&#65281;&#37027;&#20182;&#20204;&#20250;&#21435;&#21738;&#37324;&#65311;&#38500;&#20102;&#37027;&#29255;&#19995;&#26519;&#30340;&#20869;&#37096;&#65292;&#25972;&#20010;Ancient Battlefield&#25105;&#37117;&#24050;&#32463;&#25628;&#26597;&#36807;&#20102;&#12290;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Osborne, stop looking! With Adriana's strength, as long as she doesn't enter that jungle, she definitely won't have any problems! Perhaps, within this Skyfall Casket, not only is this Ancient Battlefield sealed, but there are also some areas we haven't discovered yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Adriana might have been transported to another area.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave up searching and waited patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey started eating the emperor fruit. Just as Primordial said, after eating the emperor fruit, their strength increased rapidly without any severe side effects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing they needed to do was to fully absorb the immense power contained in the emperor fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit envious upon seeing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only he could consume the emperor fruit like this, he would surely break through quickly and become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, his cultivation level can no longer improve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are no more astral projections on the Ancient Battlefield. He can't rely on killing astral projections to improve his cultivation level. He also can't consume the emperor fruit, so his cultivation level can't break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the three days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they had each consumed five emperor fruits, their cultivation levels stabilized at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, catching up with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Ancient Battlefield began to change again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The change that happens every five days began once again. Osborne was looking forward to the reappearance of astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, his wish did not come true.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, not only did no astral projection appear, but the Ancient Battlefield was collapsing, while a massive force enveloped &trade;.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Skyfall Casket is about to close!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly understood what had happened. He felt a bit regretful. It had been exactly one month since he opened the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, the Skyfall Casket was about to close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful. This time, his luck really wasn&rsquo;t great. His cultivation level only advanced from advanced Empyrean Sacredness to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And their cultivation levels all rose from primary Empyrean Sacredness to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their gains were all greater than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn&rsquo;t too disappointed. After all, compared to those swallowed by the jungle and those who died in the Skyfall Casket, his luck was considered pretty good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least he was still alive!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! Don't resist this force. It will send us out of the Skyfall Casket! Soon, we'll know how many are still alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne glanced once more at the Ancient Battlefield rapidly collapsing and disappearing before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I will come back here again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My current strength is too weak. The world inside the Skyfall Casket is still too dangerous for me! I simply can't explore it. Next time I come, I will definitely be much stronger than I am now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, I must uncover the secrets here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt darkness before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He entered a teleportation tunnel. He couldn't feel anything. When he could see again, he found himself outside the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the crack in the Eighth Skyfall Casket had already disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked around and was stunned. At this moment, outside the Skyfall Casket, there were only the four of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the Skyfall Casket, there were only him, Clara, Leroy, and Casey!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nobody else came out?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely shocked at this moment. Although he had seen hundreds swallowed by that eerie jungle, he never expected that apart from the four of them, not a single person made it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, Adriana, Callista, and the others didn&rsquo;t come out!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible? Could they all have died inside the Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, feeling a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly closed his eyes to check Adriana's life essence. Before entering the Skyfall Casket, Osborne had secretly copied Adriana's life essence. He was worried she might encounter trouble inside the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana's life essence, he would have a chance to bring her back to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne quickly checked and then frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's life essence was still glowing, which meant Adriana was still alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Adriana died, her life essence would dim. At that point, Osborne would have to use the resurrection power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to bring her back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Adriana isn't dead! But why hasn't she come out of the Skyfall Casket? The casket lid is already sealed..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the next second, Osborne froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he saw that May's life essence was also glowing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May is still alive? She was clearly swallowed by that forest! I saw with my own eyes a terrifying branch pierce through her body, through her heart..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as if everything that had just happened was shrouded in a fog.</span></p><div class="pagination">
