  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Alfreda in astonishment. He hadn't anticipated that Alfreda's overall rating would be Class SS.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class SS rating indicated that Alfreda was a top-tier expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just yesterday, Osborne had witnessed at least ten thousand individuals undergoing the Astral Testing Arch assessment. These were geniuses from various planets. Among them, only Letitia had achieved an overall rating of Class S. Few others even reached Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had heard that throughout the entire Elf race, only about ten individuals had achieved a Class S rating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alfreda was Class SS.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed Alfreda wasn't deceiving him and didn't think she'd boast about such matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving a Class S rating meant one was nearly invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those with a Class SS rating were certain to cultivate Empyrean Sacredness. For them, Empyrean Sacredness was merely the starting point. These individuals were super geniuses, possessing talents unattainable by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda felt a bit proud but still cautioned, "You mustn't tell anyone about this! If my overall rating gets out, it'll cause a lot of trouble! I trust you, so I'm sharing this. You should know, I'm quite formidable. Even if we can't recruit other warriors, I'll protect you on Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she patted Osborne's shoulder, exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't say a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then glanced at the Astral Testing Arch, feeling eager. He wanted to test himself to see what his overall rating would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he would be Class S or Class SS.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even thought he might receive a higher rating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident in himself. But without an actual test, he wasn't sure of his talent and potential level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking of giving it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda seemed to read Osborne's thoughts and encouraged, "Since no one's around, go ahead! I want to see your rating and how it compares to mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd better not! You're cautious about revealing your Class SS rating. If I test and get Class SSS, it'll cause a sensation. I'd </span><span>invite</span><span> more trouble. I don't want to be targeted..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calming down, Osborne abandoned the idea of testing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident in his talent, believing he was second to none, so testing didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that if h</span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>score was</span><span> too high, it would bring trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence made Alfreda chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You think you can get Class SSS?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Astral Testing Arch exists among various superpowers, but over countless years, only a few have achieved Class SSS! Each is called a 'Celestial Progeny.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Celestial Progeny are said to be favored by the cosmos. They advance rapidly even in daily tasks and can comprehend the Divine Ascendance Technique just by admiring the scenery... Moreover, once they reach Empyrean Sacredness, their names will be etched into the cosmos' fabric!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you're such a Celestial Progeny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda raised an eyebrow at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't realized that achieving a Class SSS rating from the Astral Testing Arch signified such prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's words opened his eyes. Tasks arduous for others seemed effortless for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his head awkwardly. He suddenly felt he might have been overconfident. Compared to such Celestial Progeny, he seemed ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His progress was swift, but not to the point of effortlessly advancing or comprehending the Divine Ascendance Technique by merely observing the scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he felt he was far inferior to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he thought Alfreda's description was a bit exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do such Celestial Progeny truly exist in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda replied earnestly, "Of course! They're rare, but they exist! If you reach Empyrean Sacredness someday, you'll see the cosmos' fabric, and there you'll find the radiant names of those Celestial Progeny!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are the cosmos' darlings, always superior. Even if born into the humblest races, they rise swiftly to become the cosmos' dominant warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Celestial Progeny isn't the pinnacle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truly powerful are the Apex Clans! Like the Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, and Angel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Apex Clans are the cosmos' true rulers! Their members are born with Infinite Sacred Bodies, reaching Empyrean Sacredness upon adulthood, and even surpassing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Members of these Apex Clans may not match Celestial Progeny in talent, but they're close, and far more numerous..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Alfreda's expression turned solemn. "In comparison, both Elves and Humans are considered lower races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, there are no Apex Clans near Elf City; otherwise, the Elves might not be in charge here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, we Elves might be enslaved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious. Hearing about the Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, and Angel Clan again was still shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these beings were born with Infinite Sacred Bodies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon adulthood, they became Empyrean Sacredness, even surpassing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any one of them was as powerful as the cosmos-favored Celestial Progeny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their power is astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between us is terrifying!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt these privileged races were enviable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to them, Humans in the cosmos were indeed lower races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, newborn Humans were too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without cultivation, even ordinary beasts could easily overpower Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Humans still had high potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's not dwell on this. I don't want to undermine your confidence! If you want to test yourself at the Astral Testing Arch, do it now while no one's around! Anyway, there's no way you'll get Class SSS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you be stronger than me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and shook his head. "No need! It doesn't matter what the rating is. Ultimately, growth depends on oneself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, people pointed at them, with no one approaching to sign up. Watching them, Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "By the way, did you set any recruitment criteria?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda replied calmly, "Yes! As long as one's realm reaches Ascension Five or above, they can join my exploration team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda in surprise, thinking he misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Requiring Ascension Five to sign up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are you serious?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
