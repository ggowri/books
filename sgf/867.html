  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa stood beneath the arena, her face pale but not seriously injured.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment her opponent effortlessly shattered her Divine and Demonic Wings, she quickly cast Blessing of Fate to shield herself. Although that defense also crumbled, it managed to dilute the force of the attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, the sting of defeat weighed heavily on her, overshadowing her physical state.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze was fixed on the woman who had bested her, clad in a mask.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though her features were obscured, there was an undeniable aura of beauty about her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tall and athletic, the woman exuded strength, her long legs embodying raw power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift, powerful kick, she had shattered Clarissa's wings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With another, she destroyed the protective barrier of Blessing of Fate, sending Clarissa careening out of the ring.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who are you?" Clarissa bit her lip, ignoring the taunts and eager to uncover the identity of her conqueror.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The masked woman smiled, "Curious about my identity? Alright then. You can call me the Blood Princess Scarlett Kane."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Blood Princess?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa was puzzled. She had expected someone who could so easily defeat her to rank among the top two hundred in the Godson Rankings or perhaps even higher.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this name didn't ring any bells.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her brow creased tightly in thought.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, on another platform, Emma was also frowning deeply. Clarissa had been defeated, and according to their agreement, this meant that Emma had won their bet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet there was no joy in her heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt an immense pressure radiating from Scarlett.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma thought, anxiety gnawing at her, "This woman is incredibly powerful! I may not stand a chance against her either!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's apprehension deepened, especially as she watched Scarlett glance her way, but Scarlett calmly stepped down from the stage without a word.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett continued nonchalantly, her tone carrying a hint of mockery, "I only came here out of curiosity for the Fatebearer. I heard she's Osborne's girlfriend and that Marlon has taken an interest in her, planning to whisk her away to Marcelin for marriage?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon is one of the few among the younger generation who interests me. If he finds you intriguing, I had to see for myself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But honestly, you disappointed me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're only Class AA, your strength is far too weak! Now that I've seen what I came for, I have other matters to attend to."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Scarlett turned and departed swiftly, leaving the audience buzzing with excitement and confusion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Blood Princess Scarlett? Never heard of her!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Such incredible strength! Clarissa has really leveled up. After these past few days of battles in the arena, her combat prowess is on par with Emma's&mdash;she's no slouch at all. The Prophet Alliance has even ranked her in the Godson Rankings, placing her at number 300!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just a Class AA ranked that high is already impressive! But to think she fell in just two moves&mdash;how powerful is Scarlett?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She has to be among the top hundred, or even the top fifty, in the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The murmurs only made Clarissa's expression sourer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Emma approached her calmly. "If she came after me, I don't think I'd stand a chance either. So how about we call this fight a draw?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa turned to Emma, her voice cold. "No way! A loss is a loss! I'm not the kind of person who can't take defeat! Even if she didn't challenge you&mdash;she took me out first. That makes me the one who lost."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, she bit her lip, her eyes suddenly locking onto Emma's with intensity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... how far have things gone between you and him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma felt a jolt run through her body, her cheeks flushing bright red.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa seemed lost in thought, understanding dawning on her. With a heavy heart, she turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma called out, "Wait, Clarissa!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me explain! It's not what you think. Please don't blame Osborne. It's all my fault. I took advantage of the situation..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma quickly recounted the entire story: how Osborne had turned her down, how he had even resisted her desperate pleas to the point of wanting to alter her memories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only due to an unfortunate twist of fate&mdash;Osborne's mental strength backfiring&mdash;that she had succeeded in her intentions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma said, guilt flooding her features, "I'm so sorry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know this is wrong, but after twenty-five years of disliking every man I met, I finally fell for him! I didn't want to miss out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're going to blame someone, blame me! I never wanted to steal him from you. I can feel it&mdash;he loves you the most, and I..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa said, "Stop! I respect Osborne's choice. If he chose to be with you, I have no objections. I never wanted to claim him for myself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I get it. Someone as incredible as Osborne can't belong to just one person. I just need a little time to accept that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Clarissa turned and walked away.</p><div class="pagination">
