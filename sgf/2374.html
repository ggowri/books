  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed month by month. In the blink of an eye, five years had gone by. During these five years, Osborne consumed a total of sixty drops of Elven Sacred Water, using up nearly half of the bottle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his gains were immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Enlightenment State sixty times and comprehending the cosmos sixty times, Osborne's spatial power's elemental essence finally broke through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This breakthrough was so smooth that Osborne didn't feel a thing. It all happened naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until he woke up that he was surprised to find his spatial power's elemental essence had already broken through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has it broken through?" Osborne murmured. He was only surprised for a moment before returning to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial couldn't help but roll his eyes and said, "Sixty drops of Elven Sacred Water are equivalent to sixty World Insights. If it still didn't break through, I would start doubting if your comprehension is really that strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Feel your Sacred Power and see if it's much stronger. Your aura has changed now; even I find it hard to see through you or sense your power and presence."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and then noticed that his aura had become more natural and mysterious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without the Sublime Concealment Orb, Osborne could easily restrain his power and aura, making it impossible for anyone to truly see through him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling is great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, sensing the changes in his Sacred Power after the elemental essence of spatial power broke through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "It has indeed become much stronger. However, it's still not enough. Next, I will push the elemental essences of my dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power to the Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne drank a drop of Elven Sacred Water and entered the Enlightenment State for the sixty-first time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time continued to pass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Enlightenment State for the sixty-fifth time, Osborne's dark power elemental essence broke through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Enlightenment State for the seventieth time, Osborne's Thunder Power elemental essence also broke through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the Enlightenment State for the seventy-fifth time, Osborne's fire power elemental essence also successfully broke through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne still did not stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was immersed in the Enlightenment State. Even though he had achieved his goal, he was unwilling to stop because each time he entered the Enlightenment State, he felt he understood the cosmos and himself better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's non-primary elemental essences, such as earth elemental, wind elemental, water elemental, and light elemental, had long reached the highest Ascension Ten. However, they had not fused into his Sacred Power. Therefore, even if they broke through to the Sacredness Level, they did not contribute to Osborne's strength enhancement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to bother with these and simply focused on comprehending the cosmos. Everything followed its natural course.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through these repeated realizations, Osborne gained a deeper understanding of himself. A thought gradually emerged in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The combat technique that suits me best might not be that complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With my Sacred Power, the power of my Maw Arrow is already strong enough. However, it&rsquo;s not comprehensive and doesn&rsquo;t fully utilize my other strengths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I used to have no idea how to blend various powers. But now, I realize it doesn&rsquo;t seem that hard. So, I&rsquo;ll create a set of archery techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This set of archery techniques will be unique to me, and only I can unleash its power. Moreover, it will continuously evolve as my abilities change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This set of archery techniques will be called Solar Sacred Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's eyes were incredibly bright. Countless ideas quickly emerged in his mind. He swiftly integrated these ideas and formed a unique set of archery techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The first move of Solar Sacred Arrow is Human Arrow. The second move of Solar Sacred Arrow is Earth Arrow. The third move of Solar Sacred Arrow is Heaven Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, all the ideas in Osborne's mind formed three types of archery techniques, each capable of adjusting its power based on the number of arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Human Arrow is the weakest, while Heaven Arrow is the strongest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even the weakest Human Arrow is more powerful than the previous Maw Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he can only shoot one arrow of the strongest Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After shooting that arrow, all his strength will be exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Chaotic Spiritual Root cannot restore his strength to shoot a second arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This arrow not only requires him to fully unleash his own Sacred Power but also to draw upon the fundamental power of the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, it would have been impossible for him to draw upon such power. However, after nearly a hundred times entering the Enlightenment State, he vaguely grasped an opportunity and finally succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made the power of the Heaven Arrow incredibly terrifying. However, he is unsure how strong it truly is, as he hasn't tested it yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Human Arrow, Earth Arrow, Heaven Arrow..." Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment he comprehended the Solar Sacred Arrow, Osborne felt his understanding of the cosmos and himself had reached a higher level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Solar Sacred Arrow can be considered the most suitable archery technique for him. Moreover, as his strength grows, the Solar Sacred Arrow can continue to improve and evolve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It might even develop into a more powerful fourth and fifth form in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very satisfied with the Solar Sacred Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already the strongest archery technique he could master at his current stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, archery alone is not enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "During my years of seclusion, the Warfare Ancient Tree has used most of its power to help me enhance the level and strength of the Warfare Scythe. Now, the Warfare Scythe is about to break through and become a Sacred Artifact. I should seize this opportunity to create a melee technique that can complement the Warfare Scythe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he immersed himself in comprehension once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne quickly created a balanced offensive and defensive technique suitable for the Warfare Scythe, the Warfare Blade Technique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, if he could resolve things from a distance with archery, that would naturally be best. He would only engage in close combat in the direst situations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne didn&rsquo;t devote too much effort to the Warfare Blade Technique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even so, relying on his understanding of the cosmos and himself, the power of the Warfare Blade Technique still left Osborne very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "This is enough. In the state duel, Agatha used Dark Phoenix Wings to close the distance between us, leaving me unable to use archery and almost leading to my defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a situation will never happen again. If anyone thinks I&rsquo;m only good at archery and that close combat is my weakness, forcing me into close combat, then they&rsquo;re courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After mastering the Warfare Blade Technique, Osborne finally stopped training. At this point, less than one-tenth of the Elven Sacred Water in the transparent bottle remained. Osborne no longer had many new insights into the cosmos or himself. If he continued using the Elven Sacred Water, it would be a waste.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to give the remaining Elven Sacred Water to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, without </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> guidance, he wouldn't have gained so much. Moreover, this time, his strength had improved significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, there was not much time left until the zone duel began. It was time for Osborne to end his training.</span></p><div class="pagination">
