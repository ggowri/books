  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena swiftly slapped Calvin's wandering hand away, shooting him an exasperated glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better behave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are too many people around. If anyone sees us, I swear I'll make you pay for it! For the sake of my reputation, I won't hesitate to take you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she shot him another fierce look, her eyes narrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, however, seemed unfazed. He pulled her closer, a playful grin spreading across his face. "Come on, you wouldn't really do that, would you? Last night, you were all over me. This tough act just makes me like you more! How about tonight I tie you up and see how you feel about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Athena's body tensed for a moment before she melted against him, her resolve wavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin felt a rush of heat at her response, his hands slipping beneath Athena's clothing, his fingers exploring with a boldness that left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, their playful banter was interrupted by a sudden tremor that coursed through Athena's body, forcing them to finally pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough of this. We can't be too reckless; if someone catches us, I might really have to kill you! You're just a human, and you've tied yourself to Oswald's illegitimate daughter. If our affair gets out, you'll be a dead man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's expression turned serious at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, we'll wait until tonight when no one's around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Calvin walked over to the window, his gaze now fixed on Osborne, who was still in his corner on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of malice flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena joined him, her voice steady. "Don't worry. I promise I'll help you deal with him. He's nothing more than a lowly human. Even if he has some skills, he's not worth my time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, we're part of the Wild Flame Army, and our destination is Divine Peak Nine! Taking out a pathetic human like him will be a piece of cake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin chuckled. "Well, I'll leave that to you! But just killing him seems too easy. I want to make him suffer first! Plus, I'm curious about the secrets he's hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems like a completely different person lately. It's like he's inherited some ancient god's legacy or treasure, considering all those Essence Crystals and his sudden power boost. Even his personality has changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we need to not only torture him and eliminate him but also extract every secret he has! When we get our hands on that ancient legacy and treasure, we'll split it right down the middle. Deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena rolled her eyes playfully at him. "Whatever you say, we'll do it your way! I'll help you make him suffer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you really think he's as insane as you say? He seems to have a lot of self-control. I put him in the tenth squad on purpose, knowing they'd end up with no rooms on the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, he didn't react at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a chiliarch, yet he's willing to sit in a corner on the deck? That level of restraint makes it hard for me to find an opening to target him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin frowned at her observation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect him to keep it together like this! Given how wild he was not long ago, I thought he'd cause a scene. If he had, it would've given us a perfect opportunity to deal with him. But he held back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin smirked, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "Well, if he's holding back, that's fine by me. I don't believe he can keep it up for long. I'll just find someone to provoke him a bit more. Let's see how long he can maintain that cool facade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The journey to Divine Peak Nine is going to take two whole days, and I can't let it be too dull, can I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena grinned and nodded. "Go for it! Whatever you want to do, I've got your back on this Malevolence Airship. I'm the one calling the shots here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her words, Calvin wrapped his arm around her waist again, pulling her closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Athena, you're too good to me! Sometimes, I regret marrying Oswald's illegitimate daughter. If only I had met you first, I could have married you instead. Then we'd be together forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena shot him a playful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! Oswald's illegitimate daughter is just from the Fero Tiger Clan. I'm from the Upper Race, the Soaring Lion Clan. You think a human like you could ever marry me? My family would never approve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin sighed dramatically, saying, "Yeah, I guess I'm just a lowly human after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But hey, thank you for not holding my status against me. I promise I'll treat you right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his hands began to wander again, but this time, Athena wasn't having it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed his hand, her expression turning serious. "I want you to use your mouth to serve me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin froze for a moment, his eyes wide, but then a smile broke across his face. "At your service!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, as they plotted against Osborne, a subtle shift occurred in Osborne's Satan's Eye, sensing the murderous intent directed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without betraying any emotion, he lifted his gaze toward the source of that hostility.</span></p><div class="pagination">
