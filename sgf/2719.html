  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Osborne was shaken back, his face slightly pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor blocked most of Russell's attack, some of the force still penetrated it and struck his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, his body was strong enough, so this injury was nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell let out a sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his attack blocked, he greedily stared at Osborne's Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you hide in the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor, you're doomed to die today! You're just an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior. Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell continued his frenzied assault, but Osborne wasn't just taking the hits. He drew out the Bloodwrought Bow, dodging Russell's attacks while starting his counterattack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's endless Sacred Power Arrows clashed with Russell's attacks, shattering instantly. He was no match for Russell, making it impossible for him to break through Russell's defense or harm him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The gap between us is still quite large!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I use the Heaven Arrow, I might have a slight chance to hurt him! But if I only use the Earth Arrow, I almost have no chance of winning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly thought of a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was extremely dangerous at this point. On their side, only a dozen Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors with combat strength were still alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his enemies still numbered over sixty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such a disparity in numbers, Osborne's group couldn't hold out for long and would inevitably be quickly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "What should I do?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While dodging Russell's attacks, he thought, "I must break away from the fight with Russell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With my strength, I can't handle him, but I can easily take on other Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors or Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors! As long as no Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors block me, I can quickly reduce the enemy's numbers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how can I shake off Russell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell was like a piece of gum at this moment, not giving Osborne any chance to escape the fight, relentlessly attacking and suppressing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, Osborne might be defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must find someone to hold off Russell! And the only ones capable of doing that are Adriana and Weston!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly looked toward Weston and Callista's battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength was inferior to Weston's, but she was unwilling to hurt him. She had already fallen into a disadvantage earlier and was injured. She was about to be defeated, but with Frederick revealing his true trump card and sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors joining the battle, five helpers appeared by Callista's side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The six of them joined forces against Weston, barely holding him off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne immediately ordered, "Weston, you hold off Russell! Leave Callista and her helpers to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston instantly abandoned the fight with Callista and immediately charged toward Russell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston blocked Russell's attack and brushed past Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stood before Callista and her five helpers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They switched opponents!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it seemed meaningless. Osborne still had to face Callista, a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and five Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His situation still hadn't improved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But only Osborne knew that switching opponents was very meaningful because Russell was clearly stronger than Callista, and the newly joined Russell was still in peak condition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Callista was already injured!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Once I take down Queen Callista, no one can hold me back! I can unleash my power freely and turn the tide!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was icy cold at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista saw her opponent change from Weston to Osborne and instantly became excited, exuding a chilling killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually dared to use some twisted means to control my own son and make him fight me! I'm furious right now. I'll kill you with my own hands!" Callista roared and launched a swift attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's kill him together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other five also took action at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You want to kill me? I'm afraid you can't!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fierce battle began. He quickly fell into a disadvantage. Although Callista was injured, as a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, combined with the support of five other Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, Osborne was no match for her at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't panic; instead, he patiently waited for the Heaven Arrow to cool down!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, to kill Anthony, he had already used the Heaven Arrow. It would take at least three minutes before he could use it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, its cooldown time was almost up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by using the Bloodwrought Bow with the Heaven Arrow could Osborne be confident in breaking Callista's defense, severely injuring her, or even killing her outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was counting down the time in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Callista was still unleashing a frenzied assault. Osborne was completely overpowered. If not for the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor, he would have been defeated long ago. Callista immediately revealed a disdainful sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, is this all your strength amounts to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Without that strange bow, you're nothing! Weston is much stronger than you!" Callista mocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "So what? In the end, Weston was still defeated by a single arrow from me! And now, he's nothing more than a dog obeying my orders! Whatever I tell him to do, he does! Even if I tell him to eat shit, he'd do it immediately! If I order him to kill you, he'd kill you without hesitation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what&rsquo;s the point of him being strong? What are you so proud of?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's face instantly flushed with embarrassment. Her terrifying killing intent erupted like a volcano, surging skyward as she stared at Osborne with blood-red eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was completely enraged. "As long as I kill you, my son can return to normal! How can a worthless piece of trash like you deserve to control him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista used all her strength at this moment, aiming to quickly kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly felt excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His chance had come!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Callista attacked with full force out of anger. Perhaps she thought Osborne no longer had the strength to fight back, so she let her guard down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his Heaven Arrow finally finished cooling down at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could use it again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t hesitate and struck immediately. After all, this was a rare opportunity. If he missed it, defeating Callista again would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the arrow shot out. By the time Callista sensed something was wrong, it was too late to dodge. She let out a scream as her defense was pierced by the arrow, and her body was blown to pieces, leaving half of her body collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn&rsquo;t dead yet, but she was close to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne dealt with Callista, no one could stop him anymore. He acted swiftly, taking down one Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior after another, as well as the Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tide of the battlefield shifted once again because of Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Frederick's true trump card, sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, were all defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battlefield suddenly fell silent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
