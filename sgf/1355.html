  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian looked at Osborne, a wave of emotion washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with satisfaction. Under his leadership, the Augustine family had once been the premier Ancient Family of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, a legacy he took immense pride in. However, when compared globally, the Augustine family was just a dot on the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thanks to Osborne, the Augustine family stood at an unprecedented height.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had become the unequivocal rulers of Blue Planet. The sheer power they wielded meant that they could dictate the fate of any faction on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's prowess was nothing short of exemplary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for his meteoric rise, the Augustine family might well have been wiped off the face of Blue Planet by any of their formidable foes&mdash;be it the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, </span><span>the Pantheon League, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, or even the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, under Osborne's formidable leadership, those same threats that once loomed large over the Augustine family had been vanquished. He had also propelled the Augustine family to unparalleled heights, establishing them as the most preeminent family on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian exclaimed, clapping Osborne's shoulder with a firm grip, "Outstanding work, Osborne! You truly are my grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you don't need to worry about the family's inner workings. I've reached godhood and feel energized! I'll handle all these minor matters. Your only responsibility is to focus on enhancing your strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, now that you've found a lead on your parents, it's time to bring them back! Even if they've entered </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, or worse, if they've passed on, we'll find their remains and bring them home! I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes welled with tears as he spoke. Seeing Osborne rise to such heights and witnessing the Augustine family ascend to the pinnacle of power on Blue Planet made his life feel complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only remaining wish was to see his only son again, even if it was just the remains of Theodore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, determination shining in his eyes, "I promise, Grandpa! I'll bring my parents back! If they've indeed entered </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I'll go there myself to find them. After all, I was planning a trip to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> anyway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before I do that, the Augustine family has a duty&mdash;to restore peace to Blue Planet! Before I leave this planet for </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I want to eliminate every last threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold resolve bubbled in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Lord League and the Pantheon League dismantled, the only adversaries left were the remnants of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Dark Deity Legion. Once he wiped them out, Blue Planet would be restored to peace, ushering in the age of Augustine family rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he could search for his parents or delve into </span><span>Celestara</span><span> without worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa and the others were still waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on, chase your destiny! I'll take care of everything else!" Sebastian nodded, determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their heartfelt exchange, Osborne set off to evaluate the status of the Blood Demon members. A portion of them had already broken through to Superior Deity, and in just a few days, he expected that number to surpass fifty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the Blood Demon members would be ready to sweep across Blue Planet and cleanse it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, he decided it was time to travel to </span><span>Felona</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this journey, he brought along the God of Star and Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they plunged into the depths of the massive chasm, a rift stretching several hundred miles long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guided by lingering memories, Osborne soon arrived at the very spot where his parents had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, in the chasm's darkest depths, the atmosphere was thick with shadows, making </span><span>it a place of deep unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star and Divine Shadow took in their surroundings with curious eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you certain there's a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> here? I can't see anything," Divine Shadow asked, her brow furrowed in puzzlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knit his brows together. "Grandma Divine Shadow, I can confirm that twenty-five years ago, a massive black vortex appeared here, most likely a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was where my parents entered the vortex. But after that, the black vortex disappeared. I suspect it was because the dimensional portal was unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, its appearance signifies that there is indeed a connection to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's eyes sparkled with renewed hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right! This place must be closest to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> without being fully connected. Let's scout around and see if we can find any clues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the trio scattered, each seeking any trace that might lead them to their goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his space elemental essence, feeling for the ripples of space around them. If a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> truly existed here, he was confident he would sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, he immersed himself in the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's eyes snapped open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've sensed it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Divine Shadow and the God of Star rushed back, their eyes alight with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there really a dimensional portal? One that leads to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?" they asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, a frown settling on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can sense an anomaly in the space right here. Its size matches the black vortex that appeared before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behind it, there's a terrifying energy ripple. But whether it leads to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I cannot say for sure."</span></p><div class="pagination">
