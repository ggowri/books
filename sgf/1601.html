Unless one had absolute certainty, it was best to steer clear of him&mdash;otherwise, they might end up in a situation like Calvin's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Athena backing him, Calvin had still been left in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Malevolence Airship grew noticeably quieter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone retreated to their quarters, leaving Osborne undisturbed in his corner as he continued his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning elemental essence was at the early stages of Level Six, but compared to the late stages of Level Six dark elemental essence and the peak Level Six space elemental essence, which could break into Level Seven at any moment, he had a long way to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, without tapping into the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, making that breakthrough wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, the Malevolence Airship finally approached Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense that his lightning elemental essence was on the verge of breaking through to the mid-Level Six stage, but he knew it would take a bit more time to make </span><span>it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he had to pause his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone emerged from their rooms, crowding onto the deck with eager eyes fixed on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're almost at Divine Peak Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard so many legends about Divine Peak Nine, but I've never seen it with my own eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got about five minutes until we reach the base. We should be able to see Divine Peak Nine soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that there are forty-two divine peaks across </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, all of which shot up out of the ground on a single day hundreds of years ago. Each peak is massive, towering high above, but what they actually look like has always been a mystery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine spans 100 thousand miles and is a military no-fly zone. We couldn't get close without orders, but now we finally have a chance to see it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is it? Why can't we see anything yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd jostled on the deck, craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the peak, but all they could see was a thick fog obscuring their view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood up, following their gaze but seeing nothing beyond the dense mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he activated Satan's Eye, instantly enhancing his vision a thousandfold. The thick fog parted before his sight, revealing what lay beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened as he gazed into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, suspended in the sky, was a massive landmass, looming like an endless expanse of dark clouds, shrouding the heavens and earth alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the enhanced vision of Satan's Eye, he couldn't see the edges of the floating land, only the towering trees and swirling mists that made it look like a scene straight out of a fairy tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really Divine Peak Nine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not just a peak; it's a colossal landmass&mdash;or perhaps an island&mdash;floating in mid-air!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Divine Peak Nine to be a floating mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame City had its own floating mountains&mdash;five of them, in fact&mdash;suspended above the city by harnessing divine power from Essence Crystals through a specific formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those mountains consumed massive amounts of Essence Crystals every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he had always thought the floating mountains of Wild Flame City were impressive and grand, witnessing Divine Peak Nine made them seem like mere toys in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area of Divine Peak Nine was at least a hundred times, if not a thousand times, larger than the entirety of Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Osborne couldn't see an end to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was majestic, enormous, and shrouded in mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a sense of insignificance wash over him. Just looking at </span><span>Divine Peak Nine felt like a massive weight pressing down on his chest, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood surged restlessly, as if an invisible pressure emanated from the peak itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the others still couldn't see Divine Peak Nine, so they remained oblivious to the awe that gripped Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say Divine Peak Nine is dangerous. Before, I had no real sense of that danger since I had never laid eyes on it. But now, even from a distance, I can feel its extraordinary presence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place holds great secrets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder if the other divine peaks feel the same way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, forcing down the turmoil in his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his gaze to other areas, recalling the announcement from the Malevolence Airship that they would reach the base in five minutes. Yet, at the current speed, there was no way they would arrive at Divine Peak Nine at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on Osborne that their base wasn't situated directly above Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was likely quite a distance away from it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
