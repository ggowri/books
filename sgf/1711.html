  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen elite warriors quickly surrounded Hannah and Osborne, and the color drained from Hannah's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't members of the Bowman family; they were part of the family's elite guard, hailing from various races. The Bowman family, as a Paramount Supreme Clan, held immense prestige, attracting countless individuals eager to attach themselves to their power. Joining the guard was the only way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The requirements to be recruited were stringent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides loyalty, candidates had to possess exceptional talent and potential worthy of the resources and time the Bowman family would invest in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors standing before Hannah and Osborne had all been forged from the family's vast resources, and they were all at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one posed a serious challenge for Hannah, who was only in the mid-stage of that realm. She had already pushed herself to her limits to break through their encirclement, and her injuries left her in no condition to make another escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Hannah refused to give in, her body tense and ready to fight to the last breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained wary of Osborne as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Hannah couldn't shake the feeling that the man standing before her was an imposter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the members of the Bowman family guard finally turned their attention to Osborne, confusion etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, who are you? Hannah, you actually have a helper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah frowned, concern creeping into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seized the moment to speak, "Hannah, didn't you say you were surrounded by dozens of peak Deity Overlord warriors? Why are there only a handful here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah froze, astonished. She stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something she had only mentioned to him through her terminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else but Osborne should know that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah thought, "Could this really be Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through her. She would rather believe that this Osborne was an enemy in disguise than face the possibility of him being here, putting himself in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! You really are Osborne? How did you get here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I tell you not to come and rescue me? Are you out of your mind? Do you really think there's a difference between facing dozens of peak Deity Overlord </span><span>warriors and just a few? With our strength, we can't take them on</span><span>. W</span><span>e'll die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her eyes glistened with unshed tears, the weight of her fear and frustration threatening to spill over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "Looks like you're not doubting my identity anymore. Don't get all teary-eyed; we'll be fine! There's a big difference between facing a dozen peak Deity Overlords and dozens of them. If there were dozens, it would be tricky to take them all out, and a few might slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But with just a dozen, we can kill it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His confidence was palpable, but Hannah stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a dozen peak Deity Overlords are just going to be easy pickings? Osborne, what makes you so sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Osborne seemed slightly weaker than she was, and taking on even one peak Deity Overlord would be no small feat, let alone a dozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they teamed up, they wouldn't stand a chance against such formidable opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she could sense that Osborne was not in great shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expended nearly a third of his blood essence, transforming over 400 thousand people into Blood Clan members back at Divine Peak Nine base. That alone had drained him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to rush here using interdimensional travel across nearly six million feet? The toll had been enormous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why was he so confident against a dozen peak Deity Overlord warriors? Hannah couldn't wrap her head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards of the Bowman family erupted in laughter at Osborne's words, their expressions dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the guards stared at Osborne with a mocking grin. "Can you believe this guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He thinks he can take us all out? Ha! A mid-stage Deity Overlord trying to wipe out a dozen of us? We're the elite guard of the Bowman family; every single one of us is top-notch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got guts, I'll give you that! I don't know who you are, but if you want to save Hannah, you're headed straight to hell with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he signaled to his comrades, their faces twisting into sinister smiles as they readied to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression hardened instantly, and she leaped in front of Osborne, her eyes wide with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you stay back! I'll hold them off! You need to find a way to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of emotion at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, pulling her protectively behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that! I'm here now, and it's my job to protect you. As long as I'm around, nobody's going to harm you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his icy gaze toward the group of guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah is my friend. You hurt her, so get ready to face the consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, a dark dimensional portal materialized in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guys, you want to challenge the geniuses from the various clans? Step through!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
