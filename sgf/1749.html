  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the determination in everyone's eyes, Raoul didn't hesitate to take charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "We've managed to escape, but as long as we're in Celestara, the Bowman family will be hot on our heels. There's only one place that's safe for us&mdash;at least for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where?" the crowd asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The East Zone!" Raoul declared, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reaction was immediate; shock rippled through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The East Zone?! That's controlled by the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul confirmed, saying, "Exactly! Only the West Zone, where the Human Community holds power, is a territory that the Bowman family can't infiltrate. Our only chance of survival is to take refuge there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't, with the strength of the Bowman family, there's no hiding place for us. We'll be hunted down no matter where we go," he added, his tone grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But will the Human Community in the West Zone accept us? Even if they do, wouldn't that be a betrayal of the esteemed Lord Malevolence?" one voice questioned, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul scoffed. "Betray Lord Malevolence? Do you think we have a choice right now? We haven't betrayed him, but the Bowman family will label us as traitors without a second thought. They won't give us a chance to explain&mdash;they just want us dead! So, are you really willing to cling to loyalty to Lord Malevolence in this situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, we're not on the same path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who want to head to the West Zone, follow me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who wish to stay and serve Lord Malevolence, you can remain here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's gaze swept over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime was the first to break the silence. "I'm with Raoul! Our Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City has only one path left, that is to the West Zone! I'll lead the remaining members of the Lopez family to join Raoul. Whatever the outcome, I'll take responsibility for my choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree! We need to go to the West Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count me in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm on board!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the ten Deity King warriors of the Mystic Feather Clan voiced their agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had made their decision that they would relocate as a clan to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, you should come with us to the West Zone! After all, you've taken out Aldrich and Alfred. The Bowman family will be relentless in their pursuit of you. With your talent and potential, if you focus on your training in the West Zone for a while, there'll be hardly anyone in Celestara who can challenge you!" Raoul urged Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and shook his head. He replied, "I will go to the West Zone, but now isn't the right time. I still have some things to take care of here before I make that move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul felt a pang of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Hannah, who stood firmly by Osborne's side, and sighed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Theodore, when you do reach the West Zone, make sure to find us! We'll owe you a huge debt of gratitude!" Raoul said, trying to remain optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul said, "Let's get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Farewell for now, my friends! I look forward to the day I see you all standing at the pinnacle of Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, take care of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Raoul didn't waste another moment. He took the Dimensional Microcosm from Hannah and set off without delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, be safe!" Hannah called after him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fought to hold them back as she watched Raoul vanish into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move, too. We need to find a place to regroup and reflect on what we've learned," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, spatial energy enveloped them, and in an instant, they disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camp, home to a staggering 400 thousand troops, had been transformed into the Blood Clan under Osborne's leadership. To the newly transformed soldiers, it was as if Osborne and his group were invisible; each one focused on their own tasks without a hint of surprise or acknowledgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, Osborne scanned the soldiers, and a wave of relief washed over him as he noted their rapid improvement after acquiring the Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! At this rate, it won't be long before they all reach the Deity Overlord stage or even the pinnacle of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guiding his companions, Osborne headed toward the largest structure within the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, only Hannah wore a look of sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment's hesitation, she decided against asking any questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the others quickly began tallying the spoils of their recent battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among their findings were four Supreme Malevolence Airships, two Supreme Malevolence Swords, two Supreme Malevolence Shields, and a number of top-grade divine artifacts, pills, Ultimate Essence Crystals, and even more Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regrettably, for Osborne, most of these items weren't particularly useful to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to keep one of the Supreme Malevolence Shields for himself but allocated the rest among his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his voice calm and reassuring, "Don't worry if you didn't get something yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're bound to encounter the Paramount Supreme Clan's super-geniuses soon enough! By then, each of us will have our own Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's our next move?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
