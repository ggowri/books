  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It will definitely be top-quality diamond,&rdquo; Wesley said excitedly. At this moment, he only wanted the speed of the cutting machine to be faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, Wesley looked at several other cutting machines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne selected all the uncut diamonds on those cutting machines. Their total price was less than one hundred thousand dollars. Wesley that cutting such uncut diamonds was a complete waste of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just now, Alison&rsquo;s bodyguard brought a piece of uncut diamond worth five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley saw the uncut diamond, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said disdainfully, &ldquo;That idiot is so weird. Although the uncut diamond is priced at five million dollars, it is a piece of garbage. All the experts in my family have seen it. None of them are optimistic about it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia said calmly, &ldquo;Osborne likes to waste money. Let him do whatever he wants. I don&rsquo;t know how he fawned over Alison. Alison actually asked him to help select the uncut diamonds. She&rsquo;s so stupid.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Luna Jewelry is no longer a threat to us,&rdquo; Wesley laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just when Wesley and Ophelia were laughing at the poor quality of the uncut diamonds selected by Osborne, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stared at a piece of strange-shaped uncut diamond. His breathing suddenly became rapid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I found it! I found a whole piece of top-grade Imperial Green diamond. It is definitely more than 22 pounds. Buy this one quickly,&rdquo; Osborne said anxiously. He didn&rsquo;t even look at the price of the uncut diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No matter how much the uncut diamond was priced, Osborne had to get it. Even if the Ashford family didn&rsquo;t sell it, he would get it even if he had to snatch it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inside this piece of uncut diamond, there were at least 22 pounds of top-quality Imperial Green diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was enough to allow Satan&rsquo;s Eye to be upgraded to level three in the most perfect state. Its value was at least billions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If top designers designed jewelry from this diamond and found the right buyers, it would be worth over 10 billion dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ten wealthy families like the Caldwell family combined are worth hundreds of </span><span style="font-style: italic;">billions</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> dollars</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> Osborne thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">I must get it no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison no longer tried to persuade Osborne about his peculiar preferences. After all, the price of this uncut diamond was not expensive. It was only one million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As long as you are happy,&rdquo; Alison said helplessly. She asked the bodyguard to take the uncut diamond away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then Alison asked, &ldquo;Do you want to cut it now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne immediately shook his head. &ldquo;No. After I buy this, I will take it back directly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This piece of uncut diamond contained top-grade Imperial Green diamond. It was worth tens of billions of dollars. If they cut it open in public, not only would Wesley be mad, but many people would also try to snatch it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wouldn&rsquo;t be that stupid. The seven pieces of uncut diamonds were enough to shock many people. There was no need to cut this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll listen to you.&rdquo; Alison did not refute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne did not continue to select, which made Alison feel relieved. She was really afraid that Osborne would be impulsive and buy those uncut diamonds worth tens of millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">This uncut diamond only cost six million dollars. It is nothing to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see the uncut diamonds I selected.&rdquo; Osborne was pleased at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although he really wanted to go home right now and cut out the top-quality Imperial Green to upgrade Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he still needed to wait for the seven pieces of uncut diamonds to be cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the two arrived at the cutting area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia immediately saw them. When Wesley saw that Osborne had picked out another piece of uncut diamond worth one million dollars, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He jokingly said, &ldquo;Osborne, are you done with your selection? You can pick a few more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at him and smiled faintly, &ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t bear it if I keep picking. These eight uncut diamonds are enough for Luna Jewelry for a long time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Wesley laughed out loud as if he had heard the funniest joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Alison and teased, &ldquo;Alison, why did you invite Osborne to help you identify the uncut diamonds? Are you crazy? He is a loser. Do you want Luna Jewelry to go bankrupt? Actually, if you need it, I can help you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked very unhappy. She snorted coldly, &ldquo;None of your business. I&rsquo;d be happy to let Osborne help me choose. Not to mention just six million dollars. Even if it&rsquo;s sixty million, six hundred million&hellip; I could even sell Luna Jewelry. As long as Osborne asks me to buy, I&rsquo;ll buy it immediately.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she finished speaking, Wesley was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked gloomy. He thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">Why did Alison obey Osborne&rsquo;s words? She used to be tough. Alison&rsquo;s crazy. She must have said this on purpose to irritate me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he didn&rsquo;t know that Alison was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Luna Jewelry belonged to Osborne. If Osborne wanted to sell Luna Jewelry to buy uncut diamonds, Alison could only obey his orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wesley, ignore them.&rdquo; Ophelia spoke up. She took a deep look at Osborne and said coldly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a piece of trash who only knows how to rely on women.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison became furious again when she heard this. &ldquo;Ophelia, what did you say? If you dare to say another word, I will tear your mouth apart.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was surprised. She didn&rsquo;t expect Alison to turn against her for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Ophelia was not afraid. She said coldly, &ldquo;Am I wrong? Osborne is a waste. He approaches you to fawn over you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia looked disdainful.</p><div class="pagination">
