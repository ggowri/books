He kicked the wooden door open and stared coldly at the remaining five gang members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who dares to harm her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy voice, filled with murderous intent, seemed to come straight from hell, striking fear into everyone's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to the desperate girl, his voice was like a melody from heaven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly opened her eyes wide and looked towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five gang members also turned to look at Osborne. After their initial panic, they calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw that Osborne was alone, they showed a fierce glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to save this bitch and mess up our plans. Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the gang members charged at Osborne with a small knife, viciously aiming for his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smirked, suddenly reached out, and grabbed the knife, preventing it from even scratching his skin, no matter how hard the attacker tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he felt an irresistible force take his knife and then stab it into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knife pierced his heart, and although blood did not flow out immediately, once Osborne coldly twisted the knife, the young man's eyes bulged, and he fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scum like you don't deserve to live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured and then turned his gaze to the other four, who were now terrified, their bodies shaking violently. Gritting their teeth, they quickly pulled out handguns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could fire, Osborne's eyes widened, and he swiftly snatched away their handguns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handguns, controlled by his gaze, floated in the air, aimed at the heads of the four men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned by this eerie scene and fell to their knees, raising their hands in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spare us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, please let us go. We know we were wrong. We won't dare again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill us, we know we were wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four men pleaded in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with excitement and admiration, she looked at Osborne as if she were seeing a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this a power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl stood up, cautiously asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her, and he felt a bit dazed despite himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt they were so similar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked so much like her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her face, Osborne couldn't help but think of his sister, and his demeanor softened as he smiled, "Yes, this is my power. My name is Osborne. What's yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl got excited again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, my name is Zoe Davis! Thank you for saving me. If it weren't for you, I might have..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes suddenly filled with endless anger and murderous intent as she stared at the four gang members, biting her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can you leave them to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe asked, pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Leave them to you? How do you plan to deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe didn't speak but continued to look at him pleadingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated and then nodded. "Alright! They are yours to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Zoe took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze turned icy cold, resembling that of a heartless assassin, which surprised Osborne as he watched her take a handgun from a corpse. After a moment's thought, he didn't stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Zoe, with lips tightly pressed, aimed the gun at the heads of the four men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scum, go to hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunshots echoed, Zoe's hands steady, each bullet finding its target, shattering their heads like hitting watermelons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face remained cold, and her eyes filled with the thrill of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once everything was over, and she saw the ghastly scene, her face turned deathly pale, and she suddenly began to vomit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood still for a long time before walking over to her, gently patting her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did nothing wrong. They deserved to die, so don't feel guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay now. It's all over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's comforting words seemed to have a magical effect, and Zoe quickly regained her composure. Biting her lip, she looked up at Osborne, and her eyes filled with hopeful light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you saved me. My life is yours now! I'm an orphan. Please take me in. I can do anything for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at Osborne, hopeful yet anxious, afraid that he might refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Take in Zoe?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
