  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days later, Osborne finally arrived near Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has the translocator for Elf City. If he wanted, he could reach Elf City quickly. But he didn't do that because he was worried his translocator had been tracked by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that happened, the moment he used the translocator to reach Elf City, he would be instantly caught by Isidore. That would be suicidal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he cannot confront Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne would rather spend more time piloting the Solar Battleship to reach Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "We've finally arrived. Agnes, let me use the Sublime Concealment Orb for a while. I'm going to Elf City. Those hunting you are likely to look for you there too. So, don't go. Stay hidden outside and wait for me. I'll be back as soon as I can."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agnes Augustine is Agatha's current name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since she was ready to live under a new identity, Agatha naturally couldn't use her original name. Although having the same name is not uncommon on Racial Convergence Planet, they must avoid any possibility of people associating her with Dark Phoenix Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Agatha gave herself a new name, Agnes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After three days of adjustment, Osborne had gotten used to her new name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha nodded. "Alright. You better hurry. Without the Sublime Concealment Orb, my aura will spread out. Those people are likely to track my location again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "I know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After merging the Sublime Concealment Orb into his body, Osborne changed his appearance and aura, then entered Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elf City didn't seem to have changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are many warriors searching for treasures in deep space. This makes Elf City bustling. However, it can't compare to the cities on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After asking someone for the time, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems we were trapped in the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence for only half a month. Now, there are still over two months left until the zone duel begins. I haven&rsquo;t missed the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne arrived near Emerald Forest Lodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emerald Forest Lodge hadn't changed compared to before. It was located in the most remote part of Elf City, very desolate, and it seemed like no one had been here for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Emerald Forest Lodge, Osborne recalled many memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alfreda, don't worry. I will bring you back to life as soon as possible," Osborne murmured. Then, he continued walking deeper into Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was a Nature Elf, and Uriah was the king of the Nature Elf Royal Family. Osborne wasn't sure about the current situation in Elf City and didn't dare to ask others casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to go deep into Elf City to use Satan's Eye to check on the Nature Elf Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were still alive and well in the Nature Elf Royal Family, he would leave immediately and return to Racial Convergence Planet with Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Isidore...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore was definitely not an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, at least at mid Empyrean Sacredness or even advanced Empyrean Sacredness. With Osborne's current strength, it was impossible for him to defeat Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wanted revenge, he could only wait for the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne arrived at the training ground, a place he was very familiar with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, he could see the Elven Mother Tree from afar. The Ethereal Elven Temple and various Elf Royal Families were all on the Elven Mother Tree. Osborne activated Satan's Eye and could clearly observe their situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nature Elf Royal Family." Osborne first looked at the Nature Elf Royal Family. Then, his expression turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Nature Kingdom of the Nature Elf Royal Family had already become a ruin, with traces of battle everywhere. Clearly, a fight had taken place here not long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, there wasn&rsquo;t a single person in the Nature Elf Royal Family's area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They really ran into trouble." Osborne bit his lower lip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He searched carefully and confirmed that Uriah and Hilaria were no longer here. Then, he immediately looked toward the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne's eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, deep within the Ethereal Elven Temple, in the center of a sealed room, three injured people lay on the ground in a sorry state.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies were covered in wounds, with blood still slowly flowing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, not long ago, they had just been tortured, and these three were Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn Isidore!" Osborne's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't act impulsively, because Isidore was currently in the Ethereal Elven Temple, not far from the cage where the three were imprisoned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne dared to enter the Ethereal Elven Temple to rescue them, he would surely be discovered by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's strength was formidable. If Osborne were discovered by him, he would undoubtedly be unable to defeat him. In that case, not only would Osborne fail to rescue Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood, but he might also end up being captured himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Isidore was at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "As the most powerful person in Elf City, it's normal for Isidore to be at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. His strength is considered formidable even on the Racial Convergence Planet. After all, even Ms. Olsen is only at mid Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of Elf City is roughly equivalent to a decent Second-rate Power on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, pondering a way to rescue Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood from the cage. Although they were still alive, if they were tortured daily, they would soon die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to rescue them, but he found that he simply couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Ethereal Elven Temple, Isidore wasn't the only warrior at Empyrean Sacredness. Osborne could see at least a dozen warriors at primary and mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any one of these people was not someone Osborne could easily deal with at his current level. Whether breaking into the Ethereal Elven Temple or sneaking in, it was impossible for him to rescue them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My strength is still too weak after all," Osborne gritted his teeth, feeling somewhat unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had actually already copied Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood's life essences. Even if they truly died, Osborne could resurrect them later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, thinking of them being tortured daily, Osborne found it hard to accept. If possible, he still wanted to save them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked Primordial, "Primordial, do you have a way?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When faced with unsolvable problems, Osborne habitually asked Primordial. After all, Primordial knew more than he did. But honestly, he didn't hold much hope. Primordial's current strength was even weaker than his. If he couldn't save them, Primordial probably couldn't either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne's assumption was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "In a situation like this, what's the point of asking me? Right now, only you can save them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne was stunned. "Only I can save them? How am I supposed to save them? With my current strength, there's no way I can sneak into the Ethereal Elven Temple, let alone break in. If I could save them, why would I even ask you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial helplessly said, "Your abilities are so complex that you've forgotten what you possess. Saving them is simple for you. You just need to use your Satan's Eye."</span></p><div class="pagination">
