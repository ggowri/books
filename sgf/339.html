  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen people who came from the Ghost Ship noticed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stopped on the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eyes that were exposed were full of surprise. Obviously, they couldn't understand how Osborne could have discovered them in advance and intercepted them here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at each other, and one of them stepped forward, looked at Osborne, and asked, "Are you Osborne Augustine, the heir of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "You know me? Well, you are here to kill me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man sneered, "Since you knew and had discovered us in advance, why didn't you escape but come to intercept us? You are bold but stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can stop us alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a faint smile, "I have to correct you. I'm not here to stop you but... to kill you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, there was a sudden silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the leading man in black burst out laughing and said arrogantly, "Kill us? You alone? What do you think you are? Even Alexander, the strongest of the younger generation in Dampston, dares not say that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you are as strong as the talents in Newport City and the masters in foreign countries?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man spoke with disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne got some helpful information from his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted, "The masters in foreign countries? It seems that you are a Rosmandi people. You wrapped yourselves so tightly that you dare not even show your faces. You are afraid of being recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me guess. In fact, the Ghost Ship belongs to a significant force in Rosmandi or even Dampston. You are the big shots in that force. Only when you need to kill an opponent will you disguise yourself as the masters of the Ghost Ship and attack the opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are no more than three forces in Dampston. Only the top three ancient families can do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you from the Paltrow family? The Walker family? Or the Carter family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the leading man was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He narrowed his eyes, flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne keenly discovered that the others tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I guessed right!" Osborne snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "I'm curious about how the Augustine family offended you. Why do you target it so harshly, even pushing it into a dead end? Why don't you tell me the reason? I'll make them correct their mistakes, and then you can let them go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading man in black snorted coldly, "Brat, don't make blind guesses. The Ghost Ship has nothing to do with any force. It's just an independent organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want to destroy the Augustine family, not because you have offended us. It's just that someone gave us a big sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking nonsense with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he dares court death, don't show mercy to him. Kill him and then kill everyone on the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the leading man in black took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hands, and the surrounding mist surged wildly. Sharp ice blades appeared and flew toward Osborne's vital points quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the ice blades approached, Osborne felt an intense, cold power that seemed to be able to freeze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ice elemental power?" Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy feeling did not affect him, but he had to be cautious about these ice blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the leading man in black was a Class A- metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of power level, the </span><span>man's</span><span> was half a level higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not afraid. He stared at the man confidently and said coldly, "Come on. It's my first time fighting against a Class A- metahuman. Let me see your power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see whether I can kill all of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at them with ocular energy, and then he immediately used his robust mind control to stop all the ice blades that were flying toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the ice blades stopped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading man in black was stunned. "Mind control power? You can actually </span><span>control my attacks! You are quite capable. We underestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're going to die today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the other four Class A- masters took action. Among them, only one was a metahuman, and the other three were martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, Osborne still felt tremendous pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>second Class</span><span> A- metahuman waved his hands, and Osborne's expression suddenly changed. The metal buttons on his clothes suddenly turned into weapons, and the man controlled them. Before Osborne could react, these metal buttons hit his body hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his body was strong enough. Although the metal buttons hit him and made him feel pain, he didn't get injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "You can control metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you a metal elemental controlling metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the man in surprise, and his eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was another elemental power that he hadn't obtained yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was determined to get the man's elemental essence!</span></p><div class="pagination">
