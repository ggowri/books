  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an incredible shift in his left eye, and once again, he was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye was on the verge of breaking through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, his Satan's Eye had already reached the pinnacle of level six, absorbing vast amounts of star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been teetering on the brink of a breakthrough for some time. Yet, before today, it had been unable to cross that threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if an invisible, impenetrable wall had blocked the path, preventing his Satan's Eye from advancing to level seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sensation wasn't unique to him; many members of the Augustine family had experienced the same frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne could feel that invisible barrier had vanished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know what had caused this sudden change, but he was certain that his </span><span>Satan's Eye was finally ready to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of all times to break through, it had to be now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, his expression serious as he glanced at Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed something was seriously wrong with her, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was. With his Satan's Eye on the verge of a breakthrough, Osborne had no choice but to focus on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time felt different&mdash;his left eye trembled violently, a sharp pain lancing through his mind as if it were undergoing a complete transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no choice but to sit cross-legged, concentrating solely on the breakthrough of his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The breakthrough lasted a grueling half-hour. When the intense pain finally subsided, Osborne felt a profound change within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had ascended to level seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the history of the Augustine family, no one had ever achieved a level seven Satan's Eye. What made it so special was a mystery even to the ancestors, merely speculated upon but never confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne possessed a level seven Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured in awe, "The effects of a level seven Satan's Eye... it really is&mdash;time freezing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason his Satan's Eye couldn't break through to level seven before was because of the time anomalies on Blue Planet. The God of Time had accelerated the entire solar system's time at the cost of life, allowing the beings on Blue Planet to reproduce and recover at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, since my Satan's Eye has broken through to level seven... that means the time on Blue Planet has finally returned to normal! The God of Time has awakened and regained her power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tell if this was a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time had been one of the most powerful deities during the Age of Gods, one of the seven Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Isa mentioned that once the God of Time awakens and regains her strength, the entire world will change! This change should be starting now, right? What will it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, shaking off the thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned his attention back to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he saw them&mdash;the cold, unyielding eyes of Ophelia, who was floating ominously before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tempestuous energy had dissipated, leaving behind an unsettling calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness, Ophelia's alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was at least a confirmation that she had successfully broken through; the wild energy that had nearly overwhelmed him hadn't killed her after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's ascended to Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though her gaze was now chillingly devoid of warmth&mdash;so frosty that Osborne hardly </span><span>recognized her&mdash;he pushed that thought aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, as he recalled Ophelia's state just before the breakthrough, his brow furrowed with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Osborne had sensed an overwhelming surge of pure, divine power radiating from her&mdash;yet now, that divine presence seemed to have vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What remained felt like the ordinary aura of a Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, frowning, "Is it just my imagination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only transitioned from Class AAA to Class S. How could she possibly have wielded divine power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his gaze shifted to the spot where the five lifeless bodies of the gods had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had mysteriously disappeared, and a chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's voice cut through the air with an icy detachment, carrying an air of superiority that made Osborne's skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt almost as if someone else, someone entirely different, was speaking through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, yet asked. "What happened to the five god corpses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Ophelia's face. "They've become the most basic form of energy, which I've absorbed. I owe them thanks; otherwise, my strength wouldn't have returned so swiftly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?! Returned? I thought you broke through to Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia just smirked, offering no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "I linger here because there's an overwhelming obsession in my heart that I can't shake. It's a conviction she left behind. She insists that I must defeat you and crush you beneath my feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She also made it clear that I have to make you regret ever crossing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you ready to get your butt kicked?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
