  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family was the most powerful family within the indigenous Human Community of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they might not compare to the immense clans and forces of the other races, they had certainly carved out a strong position among their own kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was largely due to their current patriarch, Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Deity Overlord warrior, Walter ranked among the elite fighters in Wild Flame City, wielding considerable influence. Aside from the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, and Mystic Feather Clan, who resided in the floating mountains, other races had to show Walter a measure of respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power was the reason Belinda's father, Calvin, held the position of chiliarch in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself contemplating whether to seek the Swift family's support to advance his career in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew it wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held no affection for the Swift family, especially not for Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was acutely aware that the family's dominance stemmed from Walter's ruthless actions against the Human Community's rebel forces in the past, where he had earned his reputation through bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of rebels who had perished at Walter's hands was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Harry and Amelia's parents had fallen victim to Walter's campaigns, their bodies displayed at the entrance of Rodriguez Village as a grim warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's current status and the Swift family's power were, in large part, built on the betrayal of their fellow humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne possibly have any fondness for someone like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to avenge the fallen rebels, including Harry and Amelia's parents, by taking down Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now was not the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter was a Deity Overlord warrior, and at Osborne's current level, he wouldn't stand a chance&mdash;even if Walter stood still and let him attack, Osborne couldn't hope to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he still needed to maintain his cover as Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter was merciless toward other Human Community members, but he was surprisingly protective of his own descendants, showing particular favor to Lachlan, his favored grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was through Walter's influence that Osborne had even been promoted to squad leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get going; we can talk more when we get back," Osborne said, gathering his things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Harry and Amelia a few parting words before leaving with Belinda to return to the Swift Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family resided in the heart of Wild Flame City, in the most prestigious area outside the five floating mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the strongest factions among the various races could claim a spot there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself seated in Belinda's vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that while Celestara had its own version of cars, they were unlike anything on Blue Planet. These vehicles ran on Essence Crystals, not gasoline or electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They zipped along at incredible speeds, almost like divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Artisan Institute's subsidiary, Artisan Group, had a monopoly on these vehicles, making them far too expensive for the average person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheapest model still cost at least 50 thousand low-grade Essence Crystals, while the more luxurious ones could reach into the millions. As a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army, Osborne received only two thousand low-grade Essence Crystals a month as his military stipend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would take him over two years of saving every last penny to afford even the cheapest vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary folks didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan had never owned a car, but Belinda, as Calvin's only daughter, had one from an early age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it was the most basic model, it had been a source of envy for Lachlan in its time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda said as she deftly maneuvered the vehicle onto the wide, straight roads of Wild Flame City, speeding toward the Swift Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, I heard there was an incident during your mission? Four members of the other races ended up dead?" Belinda suddenly asked, her tone curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded absently, giving a noncommittal "Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of disdain crossed Belinda's face. "You're really careless! Just getting rid of a few lowly rebellious miners, and four members of the other races ended up dead? I can only imagine how much you had to spend to keep this under wraps and avoid punishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-huh." Osborne responded coolly, but the phrase "lowly rebellious miners" rubbed him the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those "lowly rebellious miners" were part of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one thing for members of other races to look down on the Human Community, but Belinda, who belonged to the same community, simply echoed that sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left him speechless. He mused, "How could someone so readily belittle her own race?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If even she has no respect for her people, what hope do they have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne chose not to argue. Right now, he was "Lachlan," and Lachlan's views closely mirrored Belinda's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to rise up in defiance at her remarks, it would only raise suspicions about his true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dislike for the Swift family deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah, you're really disappointing! Grandpa was even trying to set you up with a noble lady from the Mystic Feather Clan for you to marry into their family. That way, the Mystic Feather Clan would have your back, and you could expect a nice promotion in the Wild Flame Army. And here you are, screwing it all up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind reeled at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? Grandpa wants me to marry into the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
