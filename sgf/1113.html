  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Stop! You can't kill me! Without me, you'll never be stronger than Osborne, and you'll never get your revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no idea how terrifying Osborne is now! He's a monster&mdash;he defeated me! Even if you somehow break through to Class S, you'd stand a chance against him. You're not his match! Only I can help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression shifted, her hand gripping the dagger faltering, but she shot Gerardo a cold, derisive look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can help me? You just admitted you were beaten by him. How can you possibly help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo took a deep breath, desperation sparking in his eyes. "I was beaten because I wasn't at my peak! If I fuse with three divine bodies, I can definitely defeat Osborne, maybe even kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I have no chance because you've destroyed my fusion process. I'm suffering severe backlash&mdash;I can't fuse with divine bodies anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you still can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you spare me and let me go, I can teach you how to fuse with divine bodies. You have the potential to become stronger than I ever was, and it can happen quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hold a grudge against Osborne, too, but I can't get my revenge. That's why I'm willing to pass on this method to you, to help you become powerful enough to take him down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just promise me you won't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's gaze bore into Ophelia, filled with pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence hung between them, Ophelia's eyes flickering with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of fusing with the divine bodies to gain strength danced in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She imagined surpassing Osborne, becoming more formidable than he could ever be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you absolutely sure that after I learn this method, I can become stronger than Osborne? Can I bring him to his knees and make him regret ever crossing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure! You saw it yourself&mdash;I only fused with two divine bodies, and I'm almost at the pinnacle of Class S! Just one more fusion, and I'll be comparable to a deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could take on even Blue Planet's top warrior, Helios, and defeat him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's with my aging body, which doesn't meld well with the divine bodies. You're far better suited for it. Your gains will be much more significant than mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me&mdash;if you get this method, you'll be unstoppable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's heart raced, adrenaline surging through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me the method already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the fire in her eyes, Gerardo released a breath of relief. A smile broke across his face as he spoke calmly, "I can tell you, but you have to let me go first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia frowned, irritation creeping into her voice. "Fine, I won't kill you. But you've got to share the method with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo shook his head. "No way! I need to make sure I'm safe before I do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing angry, Ophelia snapped, "And how do you plan to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you've got to get me out of here! Osborne is about to come crashing in, and in my current state, I can't fend him off! Take me through the secret passage! We can sort everything else out later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo spoke, Ophelia felt herself steadying, plotting her next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Gerardo a disdainful look. "You're lying to me, aren't you? You're just trying to escape. With my current power, if you recover, I'll be dead for sure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, while I'd love to get my hands on the method to fuse with a god's corpse, what I care more about is my own life! I have time power, which means I'm destined to become a top-tier master, way beyond you, even without merging with a god's corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, enhancing strength by fusing with a god's corpse? That's an evil method. It must come with serious side effects, like making you look like a freak, half-human, half-ghoul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, thanks. I'd rather just kill you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she once again gripped the dagger tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes widened in sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't kill me! If you don't want the method of fusing with a god's corpse, I can offer you something else! Like cloning techniques for gods! Or the technology to create Human Slaves&mdash;none of those come with any side effects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With these technologies, you could quickly clone countless loyal clones and rapidly build a massive power base!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just let me go, and I'll give it all to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia smirked, her voice calm and composed. "Sorry, but I already know all about those. Do you really think I've been sitting here doing nothing all this time? I've stolen everything I needed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you might as well just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia viciously twisted the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's vitality drained away rapidly, his expression frozen in a mask of horror.</span></p><div class="pagination">
