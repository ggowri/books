  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those below are all direct descendants of the Augustine family. Your ascension as heir was orchestrated by the higher power. I, along with every member of The Wise Order, endorse this decision, yet the truth remains unknown to others. Some may harbor reservations about you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, I beseech you to endure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having concluded his words, Brian observed Osborne's faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "As long as they do not provoke me, I shall not retaliate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was momentarily stunned but refrained from further comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter alighted upon a vast lawn. Following Brian, Osborne got off the helicopter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed the assembled crowd with a composed demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least two hundred pairs of eyes were fixed upon him, a significant portion of the three hundred direct descendants of the Augustine family. Save for the elderly and infants in cradles, it seemed all had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Collateral relatives were not deemed worthy of attendance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's gazes were varied - some scrutinizing, some surprised, some indifferent, </span><span>and some disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmurs rippled through the assembly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Allen's son, who was abandoned over two decades ago? Indeed, he cuts a dashing figure with an air befitting his lineage, yet he appears too young."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hear The Wise Order seeks to anoint him as heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is ridiculous! Even if he is the son of Allen, his recent return and recognition does not warrant such a role. I vehemently object!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What matter is it of yours if you disagree? The acting head, Brian, and the entire Wise Order have assented. Your dissent is meaningless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps The Wise Order seek to compensate him. I hear his life was wretched, scavenging the streets and vying with feral dogs for sustenance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a miracle he survives to this day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. If he is to be the Augustine family heir and earn our respect as young master, he must prove his mettle! Otherwise, his past miseries are of no concern to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I respect only the capable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the scrutiny of so many, Osborne remained unruffled. He was no longer the man he was a month prior; even this spectacle failed to unnerve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the murmurs, he wore a subtle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was correct. Indeed, many direct descendants of the Augustine family were displeased with Osborne's nomination as heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope none dare to challenge me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian had been covertly observing Osborne, whose composure startled Brian greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian thought, "What is this youth's origin? Valued so highly by that big shot, he must possess some prowess. At the very least, he is remarkably courageous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concluding his thoughts, Brian waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Allow me to introduce this individual. He is the son of my elder brother, Allen, left behind twenty years ago. His name is Osborne! In accordance with the decision made by myself and The Wise Order, Osborne is henceforth officially recognized as the heir of the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brian finished, the cacophony intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I object!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A resounding cry pierced the air, and a young man, about twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, stepped forth from the throng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also tall and handsome, but his countenance was severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze upon Osborne and declared coldly, "Father, I cannot accept this! Why should he become the heir of our family? Merely because he is the son of Allen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In our family, there is no such thing as hereditary succession! Among all direct lineage members, the one with the greatest ability shall be the heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I, Nathan Augustine, am the first to dissent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I object to his ascension as heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon Nathan's declaration, Brian turned livid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan, stop this folly! This matter was decided by myself and The Wise Order; it </span><span>cannot be altered! Depart at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's countenance grew even more somber at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? I can allow him to be heir, but he must first defeat me; otherwise, I will never acquiesce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's ire flared, and he glared fiercely at Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We also do not accept this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Nathan's leadership, more emerged, all between twenty and thirty years of age. They represented the younger generation of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, they were all eligible for the position of heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, the head of the family, Allen, was in his prime, so the Augustine family felt no pressing need to name an heir. Even if whispers of succession occasionally drifted, everyone maintained a careful facade of neutrality, keeping their intentions veiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Allen's sudden demise offered them a silver lining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout that time, the contenders vied intensely for the coveted position of heir, engaging in numerous competitions. Each aspirant hoped to earn the approval of The Wise Order, to ascend as the heir of the Augustine family, and to one day lead the family as its head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the competition for the heir reached its fever pitch, a bombshell dropped, shattering their carefully constructed campaigns and sending shockwaves through the family. The successor had already been chosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power they had craved had been bestowed upon a stranger, Allen's abandoned son, who had emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His existence left others grappling with burning resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rebellion simmered, ignited by four individuals who stood as the vanguard of the opposition, including Nathan Augustine, Kaden Augustine, Ryan Augustine, and Queenie Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the shining stars of the Augustine family among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were blazing with a mixture of defiance and challenge when they gazed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to lead us? Prove you have the strength to claim the leadership of the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defeat us, and we will acknowledge your claim."</span></p><div class="pagination">
