  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solution to petrification was the blood cross tattoo on Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Blood Cross tattoo was likely the legendary divine artifact&mdash;Cain's Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, its power had been exhausted, but after Osborne absorbed the peculiar energy of blood diamonds, his body transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he found that the connection between him and the Blood Cross tattoo had become tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to have genuinely become a part of his body, and his power was the power of the Blood Cross tattoo. He poured his power into it, and the power would immediately transform into the peculiar energy of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne was helplessly petrified by Medusa this time, a burst of power suddenly erupted from within the Blood Cross tattoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This power surged around him, quickly dissolving the petrification effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can shield the effects of the power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew in his heart that this was the unique effect of the Blood Cross. As long as it was activated, it could shield him from the impact of enemy power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Medusa was likely a Class A power master, she was also suppressed by the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared coldly at Medusa. "Do you want to know why? I will tell you when you're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was stunned, then the corners of her mouth curled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me? With you? Boy, if I'm not mistaken, you are actually the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, right? Others think you are just a namesake with that person, and there is a massive gap between you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I know you are that Osborne. I heard that you once killed four Class B+ metahumans of the Chevalier family, causing them to flee </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> in horror.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&rsquo;re powerful. Unfortunately, if you want to kill me, your strength is far from enough! I'm not even willing to kill you personally. Just Venom Lord is enough to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she glanced at Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Venom Lord, kill him first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord grinned ferociously. "My pleasure! I've wanted to crush him for a long time! Since he is the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, he must have a deep connection with the Draco Group! Everyone from the Draco Group should die! Everyone related to the Godfather should die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was solemn as he warned Clarissa to be careful, and he also made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord's power was to control </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Venom Lord's view, all poisons in the world were living beings. He could communicate with these living poisons called </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as one was a living being and still alive, they must be affected by his </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even a Class A master was not immune to all poisons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, feel the taste of </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord made a gesture, and countless black skulls appeared in the void immediately, each emitting an extremely unpleasant stench. The air seemed to be corrupted, making a sizzling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless black skulls covered the sky, surrounding Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, not panicking, "Do you think </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span> can hurt me? Shatter it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, and countless blue Devil's Lights were immediately shot out, locking onto each foul black skull, smashing them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord's face changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! What kind of power are you using? How could it be?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I'll tell you when you're dead! Now, it's my turn to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared fiercely, and in an instant, the void within hundreds of feet around tore apart silently, with hundreds of dimensional rifts appearing within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, nine massive dimensional rifts surrounded Venom Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before breaking through to Class B, Osborne couldn't wield this move, but now he commanded it with more dread than even Orion could muster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless dimensional rifts would restrict Venom Lord's ability to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, however, could shift positions freely among the rifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, when the nine huge dimensional rifts merged, they would unleash an extremely terrifying power in all surrounding spaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confident that no one below the master level could withstand such force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no assurance of overcoming Medusa, Osborne held nothing back, eager to take down Venom Lord swiftly. Venom Lord's distraction was crucial; if Medusa targeted Clarissa, there would be no chance for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless dimensional rifts appeared, and the surrounding void became a shattered mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectacle left Venom Lord stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just him, but even Medusa and Clarissa were momentarily frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's face was full of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power! You actually possess spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned grave. "Venom Lord, be wary! This one is not what he seems! We can't afford to be complacent anymore. You keep him at bay while I eliminate the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Medusa locked her gaze onto Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frail worm! Turn to stone! Shatter!" Medusa bellowed with ferocity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
