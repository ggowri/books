  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched down on the outskirts of Apocalypse City, carefully stowing away the Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the ship was a product of the Paramount Supreme Clan, and if anyone from Apocalypse City spotted it, they would have to explain its presence, which could lead to unnecessary complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no taste for trouble, so he decided to play it safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others stepped out, followed closely by Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and the rest. They were all eager to see the place where they would be living for the foreseeable future, especially a city fully under the control of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Darren emerged from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, lead us to the Pioneers of Starlight's base. We need to get settled," Osborne instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, my lord! Follow me!" Darren replied, taking the lead as Osborne and the others trailed behind, their eyes wide with curiosity as they took in their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, this is Apocalypse City?" one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's completely under Human Community control, and it looks nothing like Wild Flame City! Wild Flame City has massive stone houses that feel so rough around the edges, while here, everything is so refined! The villas and estates are reminiscent of Blue Planet, but on a much grander scale!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides the wider roads, there aren't those towering skyscrapers like in Blue Planet's big cities. It doesn't seem all that different, really. I'd take a city like this any day," someone else added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their chatter filled the air, a sense of ease washing over them as they admired the familiar environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Human Community practitioners bustling about on the streets made them feel even more at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike in Wild Flame City, where various races often transformed into humans but still harbored disdain for them, here they felt a sense of belonging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check out those Essence Cars! They look pretty similar to the ones in Wild Flame City!" one of them pointed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And look at those flying vessels in the sky! They resemble the Malevolence Airships from Wild Flame City!" another exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Darren spoke up, "Those are called Light Airships! They're quite similar to Malevolence Airships in terms of performance and appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're produced by the Luminous Research Institute under the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Airships also come in different grades, low-grade, mid-grade, top-grade, Ultimate Light Airship, and Sanctum Level Light Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sanctum Level Light Airship is equivalent to the Supreme Malevolence Airship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The difference is that the Supreme Malevolence Airship isn't sold to the public; even the strongest from various races can't use it&mdash;only the Paramount Supreme Clan has that privilege. In contrast, Sanctum Level Light Airships are available for anyone to purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you have enough Essence Crystals or Celestial Crystals, any individual or faction can buy one from the Sanctum of Light's shops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's explanation sparked excitement among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "How much does a Sanctum Level Light Airship cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren replied quickly, "It depends on whether it's outfitted with weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's unarmed, a Sanctum Level Light Airship will set you back about 100 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals or one thousand Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you add weapons, the price can vary depending on their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's even a type of Light Cannon capable of threatening peak Deity Kings that costs significantly more than the Sanctum Level Light Airship itself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That expensive? Who in their right mind could afford that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "A hundred thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That translates to a staggering 100 billion when converted to low-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, the purchasing power of low-grade Essence Crystals is roughly equivalent to currency on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, a Sanctum Level Light Airship costs 100 billion low-grade Essence Crystals or one thousand Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I'm not short on Celestial Crystals, that price is outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I definitely won't be making that purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, we have the Supreme Malevolence Airship, which, aside from slightly weaker weaponry, is more than capable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself intrigued by the Light Cannon that could threaten peak Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I used to think that Lord Malevolence's Artisan Institute was impressive, having developed divine artifacts like the Supreme Malevolence Sword, Supreme Malevolence Shield, and Supreme Malevolence Airship, which are on par with Ultimate divine artifacts. But it turns out the God of Light's Luminous Research Institute is just as formidable!" Osborne murmured to himself, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, catching the hint of admiration in Osborne's voice, couldn't help but feel a swell of pride. "My lord, you've got it all wrong! The Luminous Research Institute isn't just comparable to Lord Malevolence's Artisan Institute; it's actually far superior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No other race excels in research, innovation, and development like we, the Human Community. The weapons, armor, and vessels produced by the Luminous Research Institute are all several notches stronger than the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, and they come in a wider variety!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you get a better grasp of it, you'll see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason the Human Community has been able to fend off the Dark Deity Legion for so long without being wiped out is largely thanks to the weapons and armor from the Luminous Research Institute!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
