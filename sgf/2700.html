  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kendra, you stay in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and wait for me! If something feels off, just control the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to return first, no need to wait for me," Osborne said to Kendra.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra was a bit worried, "Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum has two driving methods. One is powered by the operator's Sacred Power, with its strength depending on the operator's abilities, and the other is driven by Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne handed the control to Kendra. As long as there are enough Sacred Crystals, Kendra can operate the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Even a warrior of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness would find it hard to break through the defenses of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the attacks launched by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum might be unstoppable for a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, with the protection of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Kendra's safety should be assured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rushed out of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide his presence and quickly approached the distant Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior. With the Sublime Concealment Orb, Osborne had no worries about being exposed; unless the opponent saw him with their own eyes, they would never detect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Domain Suppression Stele can suppress energy flow within a radius of up to a million miles. However, it doesn't mean that activating the Domain Suppression Stele will necessarily suppress energy flow in the entire million-mile radius. The specific range of suppression can be controlled."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly arrived near the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still didn&rsquo;t take action immediately but summoned Flash first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash had recently been staying in Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, waking up to eat Beast Soul Flower and Ethereal Bloom, then having Drum purify his body, so his cultivation level improved rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash's cultivation level had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His true form was now immensely massive, even larger than the Magma Devourer back then, resembling a giant dragon with three differently colored heads and six pairs of wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His true form was simply enormous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne stood next to Flash's true form, it would be like an ant standing beside an elephant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, whenever Osborne summoned Flash, Flash would consciously transform into the form of a warhorse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash excitedly looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knew that Osborne summoning him meant a battle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a battle maniac, Flash was naturally excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Don't rush! The next few days will let you fight to your heart's content!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since he decided to use the Domain Suppression Stele, Osborne naturally wanted Flash to contribute. The two of them together, plus the Domain Suppression Stele, no one could escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Flash's strongest assets, besides his Dragon's Breath, are his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a mutated Astralwreck Dragon, Flash's strength is absolutely top-tier among the Beast Clan. When Flash was just born as a primary Empyrean Sacredness, he could already clash head-on with an advanced Empyrean Sacredness Magma Devourer, competing in raw power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Flash's cultivation level has reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, making his power even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne and Flash were to compete in physical strength at the same cultivation level, he wouldn't be much stronger than Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything is ready.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, let the hunt begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne activated the Domain Suppression Stele without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, an invisible energy burst out from the Domain Suppression Stele, rippling outward from its center and spreading rapidly in all directions at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wherever the ripples passed, all energy flow came to a halt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt completely unable to use Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only Sacred Power, but even his Soul Current Ocean had become incredibly calm at this moment, completely unusable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The effect of the Domain Suppression Stele is really powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, apart from physical strength, Osborne couldn't use any other power. Even Sacred Artifacts like the Bloodwrought Bow were unusable, leaving him only with melee weapons like the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash was in the same situation. Within the range of the Domain Suppression Stele's influence, it couldn't even unleash Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's working!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sat on Flash's back and pointed in a direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, head that way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without being able to use energy, Osborne's speed was far inferior to Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Flash had six pairs of wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without using energy, Flash relied on its six pairs of wings to move as fast as a shooting star, quickly arriving in front of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man looked shocked and serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, he suddenly felt a strange force sweep through his body, permeating every corner around him, and then something strange happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could no longer use Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Don&rsquo;t talk about Sacred Power&mdash;right now, he couldn&rsquo;t use any power except the strength of his body</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left him utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he had entered a special area and was hesitating whether to study it or leave quickly when Osborne appeared riding Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw Osborne, his face instantly showed fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, he saw with his own eyes Osborne using a peculiar bow and arrow to seriously injure Weston with a single shot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Weston is a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is just a Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Weston was seriously injured by Osborne with one arrow, so he naturally couldn't be a match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He barely thought twice and turned to flee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he tried to send a distress signal to others nearby but found it impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he found Osborne blocking his way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without being able to use any energy, Flash's speed was far greater than his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at him with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, is it you causing trouble?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man knew he couldn't escape, quickly calmed down, gritted his teeth, and said, "What do you want? Let me tell you, Frederick is nearby! He'll notice something's wrong here and come over soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you run away quickly! Otherwise, it'll be too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered with disdain upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trying to scare me? Useless! Frederick isn't nearby. There are a few Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors around, but unfortunately, you can't send a distress signal, and they have no idea what's happening here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man asked in fear, "What exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne coldly said, "What? Simple, to restrain you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, grab him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and immediately had Flash take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash let out an excited roar, dashed forward, and slammed into the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man panicked immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to use any energy, he couldn't even activate Sacred Power Defense, let alone the power of any Defensive Sacred Artifact. He could only grit his teeth and pull out a massive shield to block in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, such defense couldn't withstand Flash's power. With one charge, Flash knocked the shield away, and the immense force made the man spit blood and fly backward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt like his body was about to tear apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash looked disdainful, as if saying, "I haven't even tried yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After several collisions, the man fell to the ground, covered in blood, unable to move, as if all his bones were broken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first prey, successfully dealt with!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately ordered Flash to stop, to avoid killing the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He summoned Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, it's your turn next!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
