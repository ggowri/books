  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! I thought you were some big shot. Turns out you're just a useless wimp who can only rely on an Apex divine artifact!" the God of Light said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tyrese just laughed it off. "Hey, if I've got an Apex divine artifact, why not use it? When our cultivation levels are about the same, it's only natural to use such a powerful tool to settle the score. And I'm not stopping you from using one either...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Right! I almost forgot your Apex divine artifact got smashed to pieces by Zayne a thousand years ago. Sure, you're back after reincarnation and even stronger than before, but I bet you haven't found a suitable Apex divine artifact yet, have you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Tyrese flashed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his short stature, the huge knife he held didn't look the least bit comical. Anyone who saw Tyrese at that moment could feel the sharp killing intent and edge that suddenly radiated from him as he grasped the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an Apex divine artifact no less powerful than the Ninefold Heaven's Tower. Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, it was considered top-grade, and on Celestara Planet, it was simply unrivaled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without the Apex divine artifact knife, he could hold off the attacks of the God of Time. Now that Tyrese had it in his hand, he was dead certain he could defeat the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese said with confidence, "Let's have it out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zayne always told me that the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community were incredibly talented. It's a pity I couldn't meet them all. But it's still pretty cool to face you, the God of Time, and have a go at you. Now, show me all you've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyrese gave the knife a fierce shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a terrifying blade-light flashed and vanished in the blink of an eye. The next second, it appeared right in front of the God of Time and struck her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time staggered backward, her face pale and her lips tightly pursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese also possessed time power and had infused it into his attack. She hadn't even had time to dodge. Although the terrifying blade-light hadn't completely broken through her defenses, it had still posed a huge threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one random attack is this powerful... I'm in for a tough fight today. But if you think you can beat me, you're dreaming! The Human Community is under the protection of the God of Night. I'll stand guard here until the God of Night shows up! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time launched an attack on her own initiative. She knew time power wouldn't work well against Tyrese, so she didn't waste her energy on it and instead unleashed her divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a terrifying battle erupted. Two Supernal Deity Kings at the peak of Ascension Seven were now locked in a fierce fight in mid-air. The terrifying blade-lights and sharp fist-powers clashed violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a radius of about 60 miles of their battle, no one dared to stay for fear of being blasted to bits by the aftershocks of their fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Icy One, a warrior at the same Ascension Seven cultivation level, didn't dare to get close to the battle area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So strong! Both the God of Time and Tyrese are incredibly powerful! We're all at Ascension Seven, so why is there such a huge gap in our strength? And did Tyrese show up because the esteemed Lord Malevolence doesn't trust us and thinks we can't break through the Human Community in the West Zone? That's why he brought in a friend from the Racial Convergence Planet to help out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face turned ashen at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Tyrese nor the God of Time was someone he could take on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an intense exchange, Tyrese and the God of Time both retreated again, their faces looking a bit pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese said icily, "God of Time, I admit I underestimated you! Even when I used my Apex divine artifact battle-knife, I still couldn't take you down when you were bare-handed! If we had a fair fight, I'd probably lose to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" God of Time snorted. "You got that right! If you're smart, just get out of here. I don't want to kill anyone today. I'm just waiting for God of Night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tyrese gave a faint smile. "Leave? No way! Zayne paid a price to have us come and back him up. How could we just leave like this? I may not be able to handle you, but you're not gonna make it out of here today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said that, God of Time's face hardened abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'We'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Tyrese grinned faintly. "Zayne didn't just hire me to help. I thought I could deal with you on my own, but it turned out I underestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, no more hiding. Everyone, come out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get rid of these guys quickly and head back to Racial Convergence Planet. The celestial energy here is way thinner compared to that on Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Tyrese looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone laughed. "Tyrese, looks like you're not up to the task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were bragging before that you could take out this little girl all by yourself. But after all this fighting, even with your Apex divine artifact battle-knife, you still couldn't beat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Newbie, you better train more when we get back to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's face darkened. "Humph! That's because this little girl is really strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She came back from the cycle of reincarnation in just a thousand years, with the experience and memories of two lifetimes. Plus, she has incredible talent. It's normal that I couldn't handle her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, I'm not being stubborn. That's why I called you guys out, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese's words only made the laughter even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a few figures suddenly appeared beside Tyrese, looking at God of Time with faint smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Tyrese, there were seven figures in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had an energy signature no weaker than Tyrese's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, whose energy was as vast as the sea, was even more powerful than Tyrese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's face instantly turned extremely pale, with a hint of panic in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Six Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings?! One Ascension Eight?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To deal with me, Lord Malevolence really spared no expense! He even got you guys from Racial Convergence Planet. It seems Lord Malevolence is dead-set on wiping out the Human Community on Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Tyrese smiled, "The Human Community on Celestara Planet? Just a low-class race. Your existence has been getting in the way of Zayne's plan to rebuild the Malevolence Empire. So, of course, you all have to be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity God of Night isn't here. Otherwise, we'd really like to have a go at him and see how powerful this guy that Lord Malevolence fears actually is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the seven of them stared at the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King said to her indifferently, "Little girl, I'll give you a chance. Surrender now, and I won't kill you. From now on, you can be my</span><span> maid and serve me well. I'll take you to Racial Convergence Planet, where you'll have better cultivation conditions and can reach a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll have to be harsh and kill you. I wonder if you'll be lucky enough to come back from the cycle of reincarnation this time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, there was a clear threat on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a terrifying aura pressed down hard on the God of Time, making her face turn ashen.</span></p><div class="pagination">
