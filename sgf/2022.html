  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the situation in the arena took a turn for the worse, Icy One immediately decided to have his side concede.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings were not common in the Paramount Supreme Clan. They were considered pillars of the clan. A loss of a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings on the arena would be a devastating blow, even for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to send a mental message to the fighters in the arena, Osborne seemed to sense something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly spoke up, "They might be about to concede!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let them concede! We need to eliminate all of them in the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne personally stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first move since stepping into the arena. Facing a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, the only way to quickly eliminate them was to use spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, terrifying spatial energy began to surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless terrifying Dimensional Razors suddenly appeared in the arena. All other energies and techniques were instantly shattered upon contact with the Dimensional Razors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Dimensional Razors flashed, reaching the enemies in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These fighters had just received Icy One's mental message. Though reluctant, they were preparing to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could speak or leave the arena, Osborne's Divine Ascendance Technique, Spatial Oblivion Slash, erupted. The terrifying Spatial Oblivion Slash instantly enveloped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they felt the power of the Spatial Oblivion Slash, and Their expressions filled with shock and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that Osborne's spatial power had reached the late stage of Level Nine. The Spatial Oblivion Slash he unleashed was so powerful that even Ascension Four or Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings could be injured if they took it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he had killed the Icy Nine, aside from the Absolute Forbidden Zone suppressing Icy Nine's cultivation level, a significant reason was the sheer destructive power of the Spatial Oblivion Slash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was even stronger than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Spatial Oblivion Slash against these Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings was like using a boulder to smash eggs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone hit would die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of the Spatial Oblivion Slash was so fast that there was no way to dodge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, a horrifying scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's first move unleashed countless Dimensional Razors, which swiftly swept across the hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings in the arena. In the next second, the bodies of these hundred fighters were torn apart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing screams, combined with the sight of blood spraying everywhere, left the countless spectators utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings were hit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the quicker ones managed to avoid fatal injuries, but Anastasia, Zoe, and the others swiftly finished them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the situation in the arena changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, who had been alive and kicking moments ago, were now all dead in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complete and utter silence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt countless eyes on him. Members of the Human Alliance, the Dark Deity Legion, and even Icy One and the God of Light. All of them were staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the sound of gasps filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? He's only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King! With one move, he killed dozens of Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings. Even those who avoided fatal blows were severely injured... Even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King would struggle to do that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power! A terrifying spatial Divine Ascendance Technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is too terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder he's the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. No wonder he didn't make a move in the previous battles..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension One cultivation, but strength comparable to Ascension Four?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he even human?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan's top geniuses, Five Brilliant Scions, are nothing compared to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, heated discussions erupted as everyone was shocked by the strength Osborne had displayed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, if someone had told them that an Ascension One Supernal Deity King could kill dozens of Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings in one move, displaying strength comparable to an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, they would have thought the person was insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how talented someone was, such a monstrous existence couldn't possibly exist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the truth was right before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten billion members of the Human Alliance and fifty billion of the Dark Deity Legion had witnessed Osborne achieve this godly feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne as if he were a dazzling sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One was also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be? He's only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King! How can he have such a powerful attack? This is absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face twisted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's killing intent had reached its peak. He even felt the urge to personally step in and eliminate Osborne right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Osborne were given more time to grow, his cultivation would have reached Ascension Three or even Ascension Four...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wouldn't even he, Icy One, be no match for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if Osborne continued to grow stronger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he even threaten Lord Malevolence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Icy One's killing intent nearly overflowed. But at that moment, he felt a gaze piercing through the Ninefold Heaven's Tower directed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gaze of the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light seemed to have sensed Icy One's desire to attack Osborne and was warning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Icy One calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that with the God of Light watching, even if he personally intervened, he wouldn't be able to kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to find another way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about the upcoming matches?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ascension Two match resulting in all their fighters being wiped out, they had already lost six matches today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there were still two more to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the combat power Osborne had displayed, even if he sent out a hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings for the next match, they would likely lose again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the Ascension Three match, we'll concede immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford to lose any more people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One gritted his teeth. "But we absolutely cannot lose all eight matches today! So, the final Ascension Four Supernal Deity King match is a must-win for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is also our best chance to win! Among the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, only Osborne has strength comparable to an Ascension Four. But even so, he can't single-handedly determine the outcome of the Ascension Four match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, both sides will send ten Ascension Four warriors to fight! With just Osborne alone, the Human Community can't win! If he dares to participate in the Ascension Four match, we might even find an opportunity to...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, a glint of determination flashed in Icy One's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could kill Osborne in the arena, that would be ideal. At the very least, the Dark Deity Legion's morale, which had hit rock bottom, would recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Human Alliance's morale would plummet once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare for the Ascension Four match immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One said coldly, "Send out the ten most elite Ascension Four warriors. Even if they lose the match, even if they all die in the arena, they must eliminate Osborne!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
