  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dangerous glint flashed in Derek's eyes as he coldly said, "Who do you think you are? Do you think being the boss of Skyefall Security makes you important enough to threaten me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You think I cannot handle the consequences of not honoring the wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, I would like to see how you make me suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing his harsh words, Derek prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, a faint voice suddenly sounded, "Derek, I am also a witness to this wager. Are you sure you want to renege on it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice was extremely calm and came from the viewing platform. Everyone turned to look and saw two people standing in the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a woman who appeared to be in her thirties. She had an alluring figure and a swaying waist that captivated everyone present. The important figures in the crowd recognized her as Debbe Lewis, the head of Draco Auction House in Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was not her who spoke, but an elderly woman she was supporting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly woman, around sixty years old, had a stern expression despite her age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face changed drastically upon seeing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives of the other ancient families also looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is here too, and she is a witness to this wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She actually showed up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representatives of all the ancient families looked at the old man with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The representatives of the ancient families looked at the elderly woman with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the representatives were puzzled as they did not recognize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Austin did not know who she was. Seeing Clarissa's shocked expression, she quickly asked in a low voice. "Clarissa, who is she? She seems to have a high status?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took a deep breath and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her name is Serena Hernandez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serena Hernandez?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin murmured, feeling that the name sounded familiar but could not quite place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa continued, "She is the general manager of the Draco Group in Skyefall. Decades ago, she was already a martial master. No one knows how powerful she is now. Additionally, she has another identity&mdash;she was once the personal attendant of the Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The general manager of the Draco Group in Skyefall?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A martial master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The personal attendant of the Godfather?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin finally remembered and exclaimed in awe, looking at Serena with a face full of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's expression also changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Serena with a conflicted expression and asked, "Ms. Hernandez, so you are here too? Were you the one who stopped me from killing him just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Derek had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena glanced at Isa, who was hiding behind the crowd, and smiled faintly. "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face grew darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously thought Serena was admitting it. Since she was the only martial master present, who else could have stopped him from killing Osborne without being noticed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, do you intend to intervene in this matter as well? This has nothing to do with the Draco Group, does it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena remained calm, "Indeed, it has nothing to do with the Draco Group. However, Skyefall Security was once sold by the Draco Group, and Valentin was once my subordinate. He invited me to witness this wager, and since I agreed, I must ensure that the wager is honored, allowing the winner to collect their due."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the Chevalier family has lost. It would be best to pay the one-billion-dollar wager and not make things too ugly. Do not force me to take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Serena spoke, Derek's face grew even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated, struggled, and was deeply apprehensive, contemplating the consequences of refusing to pay the wager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Would the Draco Group take action against the Chevalier family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the Chevalier family withstand it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result was clear that they could not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Chevalier family was a powerful local force in Skyefall, comparable to the Draco Group in influence, the Draco Group's reach extended beyond Skyefall and throughout the entire Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather was the underground king of Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group was the largest organization in Rosmandi. If they truly decided to take on the Chevalier family, there was no way the Chevalier family could win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek spoke with a gloomy face. "I did not expect you to bring Ms. Hernandez as a witness. I underestimated you. Today, the Chevalier family admits defeat. We will pay the one billion dollars wager!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a diamond mine in the southern mountains of Cloudsea City. Its value is no less than one billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, you can send someone to sign the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After glaring at Osborne for a long time, Derek finally turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled without stopping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Derek left, everyone gathered around Serena, with fawning looks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Donna wanted to get close and speak to Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were all stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena calmly said, "Everyone, I have not been involved in affairs for a long time. Please do not surround me. You may all disperse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone left with regret but did not dare to say anything and bid their farewells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Serena also left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was about to leave when he received a message from Debbe on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez wants to see you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
