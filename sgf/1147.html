  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having tested his physical strength and defenses, Osborne felt </span><span>very</span><span> confiden</span><span>t</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when he was merely Class AAA, he had already managed to defeat numerous Class S opponents, even holding his ground against a dozen or more at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after the enhancement from Gerardo's top-tier cultivation liquid and a transformative breakthrough into Class S, his body had </span><span>transformed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with three months of relentless </span><span>refining from immense fate power, he had reached the pinnacle of what a Class S could achieve. There was no further room for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was confident that even if faced with a hundred </span><span>top-tier</span><span> Class S </span><span>enemies</span><span>, he could handle them with ease, potentially taking them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even </span><span>believed he could stand toe-to-toe with</span><span> deities, and perhaps even </span><span>defeat them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing</span><span> in mid-air, he allowed the countless flying Ferocious Beasts to assault his body, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>N</span><span>ext</span><span> step</span><span> is forge a Divine Body! By refining my bones and flesh with sheer power, I can transform them into Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, paving the way to the divine realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can feel it; if I set my mind to it, crafting Divine Bone and Divine Flesh will be a walk in the park, making me a true deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>w</span><span>hat I'm aiming for isn't just any old Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>n ordinary</span><span> Divine Body isn't worth a dime! Sure, I could keep refining and leveling it up later, but if it's mediocre from the </span><span>start</span><span>, I'd </span><span>boost it </span><span>to</span><span> a Level Three Divine Body at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my Divine Body takes shape as a Level Three </span><span>in the beginning</span><span>, then leveling it up three times could get me to a Level Six Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if I start at Level Six, there's a chance I could reach a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the higher the level when the Divine Body forms, the greater the potential for future growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I'm not aiming for a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, or a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body, or even a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, my sights are set on the Omnipotent Divine Body&mdash;something beyond Level Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to ponder, "Isa once mentioned that the Omnipotent Divine Body is merely a legend. Many Deity Kings are stuck at just a Level Seven Solar Divine Body. The higher-tier bodies like the Level Eight Galactic Divine Body and Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body are incredibly rare, almost mythical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the Breath of Celestial, there's a chance to forge the ultimate Omnipotent Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The catch? My Divine Body has to be at least a Level Seven Solar Divine Body as it </span><span>forms! Only then can I hope to refine it into an Omnipotent Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Seven Solar Divine Body... that's a tall order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that even some Deity Kings only managed to achieve a Level Seven Solar Divine Body after </span><span>millennia</span><span> of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here he </span><span>was, needing to reach that level the moment his Solar Divine Body took shape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was practically an impossible feat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people entering the divine realm ended up with a Divine Body devoid of any rank, often failing to even reach Level One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a handful of prodigies could manage to create a ranked Divine Body, and even then, it was usually just Level One or Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three was exceedingly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were not the case, the God of Star wouldn't have been so ecstatic about Isa remaking her Divine Body into a Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Achieving a Level Four Divine Body upon becoming a deity was a mark of sheer genius, a sign of potential to become a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, aiming to achieve a Level Seven Divine Body right as he ascended to godhood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever </span><span>managed</span><span> it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was determined to give it a try. Isa had mentioned that crafting a Divine Body using the Breath of Celestial had the potential to transcend limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trusted Isa</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Isa also </span><span>warned that such a body could just </span><span>as easily </span><span>turn out to be </span><span>nothing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne chose to </span><span>ignore</span><span> that part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I'll wipe out this Beast Tide, then return to forge my Divine Bones and Divine Flesh, and make a push for the godly realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne sprang into action once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began throwing punch after punch, each </span><span>with devastating force, shaking the </span><span>grounds</span><span>. Within a radius of several hundred yards, every flying Ferocious Beast, regardless of its rank, was obliterated into a mist of blood, leaving no remains behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of eye</span><span>, Osborne had unleashed dozens of punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearly 10 thousand flying Ferocious Beasts around him exploded </span><span>instantly</span><span> into a crimson haze that stained half the sky red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Anastasia and Zoe, who had been anxiously watching, utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And </span><span>Cillian and his three companions, from a greater distance, rubbed their eyes</span><span> unbelievably</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, that was a horde of tens of thousands of flying Ferocious Beasts&mdash;many of them Class A Dark Exotic Beasts&mdash;a nightmare even for top-tier Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne casually dispatched them with one punch after another, reducing them all to a bloody fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's practically a god!" Cillian and his companions marveled, their faces glowing with admiration as they gazed upon Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
