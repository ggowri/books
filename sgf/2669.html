  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to venture deeper into the jungle to continue searching. He worried that if he missed this chance, he might never find the emperor fruit again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The emperor fruit was like a legend; many had heard of it, but few had actually seen it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only in the deeper parts of the universe, where Spiritual Energy is denser and the Divine Principle more complete, could emperor herbs and emperor fruits possibly grow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you'd better not go in," Primordial said gravely, "Don't you find it strange? The entire Ancient Battlefield is in ruins, not even a blade of grass, so why is there a jungle here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped in his tracks and said doubtfully, "It is a bit strange! But what's the problem? There are also many peculiar plants in the Ninth Skyfall Casket that can enhance strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "But this isn't the Ninth Skyfall Casket! In the center of an Ancient Battlefield, there's actually a jungle! No matter what you think, I feel something's off. For safety's sake, I think you shouldn't be too greedy&mdash;just take these and leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plants that can grow emperor fruits should normally have developed their own consciousness by now, becoming members of the Plant Clan..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, I don't sense any consciousness in these plants! They're no different from ordinary trees..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know what this means?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "What could this mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered, "They can grow emperor fruit but have no consciousness... This means they were planted by someone! Someone deliberately restricted them, preventing them from having consciousness! Or if they did gain consciousness, it was directly erased by that person..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "You mean this jungle and these emperor fruits have an owner? Someone planted them here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "That's right! This is very likely the orchard of someone incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Skyfall Casket! To plant such a vast orchard here, and even in the outer areas of the orchard, emperor fruits can grow..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This person is so powerful that you can't even imagine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I advise you not to be too greedy! You've already picked hundreds of emperor fruits. If you take them gradually, they'll be enough for you to break through and become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Before the owner of this orchard discovers you, you'd better leave quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, if you really get into trouble, you might not even have a chance to resurrect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's expression was particularly serious, and Osborne's face grew solemn as a result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a bit conflicted and torn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the outskirts of this jungle, he had already obtained hundreds of emperor fruits. He thought that if he ventured deeper, there might be so many emperor fruits that he couldn't even count them, and perhaps even treasures more valuable than emperor fruits!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he felt that what Primordial said made a lot of sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Greed could very likely cost him his life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by restraining greed can he live longer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" Primordial urged, "I have a growing bad feeling... This jungle is definitely some big shot's orchard, not something you can afford to mess with right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, you have the Ninth Skyfall Casket key. Come back to explore when you're stronger! If you're unwilling now, just return later, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial urged Osborne to leave quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have a feeling that if you don't leave now, we're going to be in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I trust you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer hesitated; he decided to trust Primordial's judgment and intuition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at the jungle and suddenly felt as if it were an abyss&mdash;once he entered, there would be no way out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he was drawn by the numerous emperor fruits and hadn't paid much attention to sensing carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he also felt something was off, and a bad feeling arose in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scanned with Satan's Eye, quickly found a safe zone, and swiftly moved over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Away from the jungle, Osborne felt much more comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at the surrounding astral projections and couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These astral projections were too powerful; he couldn't kill them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just a little more and I could break through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, but fate gives me no chance. These astral projections can't be killed, so I can't raise my cultivation level. I worked so hard to get hundreds of emperor fruits, yet I can't eat them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps you could try taking down an imperial-tier astral projection!" At this moment, Primordial spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at him in confusion and said, "Take down an imperial-tier astral projection? You think I don't want to? I've already tried before. Even when I use my most powerful attack&mdash;Heaven Arrow&mdash;with all my strength, I still can't break through the defenses of these imperial-tier astral projections!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can't break through their defenses, I can't take them down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled faintly upon hearing this, "Using the Bloodwrought Bow naturally won't break through the defenses of these imperial-tier astral projections! But you have an even more powerful weapon..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An even more powerful weapon?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes suddenly lit up, and he said, "Are you talking about the Apocalypse Bow?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Didn't you make an agreement with the Apocalypse Bow? You can use it once a day, right? The Apocalypse Bow was once a Sovereign Artifact, known as the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos. Even though its current power is less than a billionth of its peak, it's still a top-tier Imperial Artifact. The Bloodwrought Bow can't compare at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you can use it once a day, don't waste it! Use it to deal with these imperial-tier astral projections and see if you can take them down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Why didn't I think of that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Apocalypse Bow now rivals the top-tier Imperial Artifacts. The Heaven Arrow it shoots is absolutely countless times stronger than the Bloodwrought Bow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trying to kill an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness with the Bloodwrought Bow is definitely impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne's own cultivation level is too low, and the gap with the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness is far too vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana, without using an Imperial Artifact, cannot break through the defense of an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with an Imperial Artifact, it's a whole different story!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, it's a top-tier Imperial Artifact, and as long as he can break the defense, he has a chance to take down an imperial-tier astral projection and absorb their power!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately took out the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had reached an agreement with the Artifact Soul of the Apocalypse Bow, allowing him to use it once a day. The current Apocalypse Bow in his hands was completely different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne held it, feeling he could easily take down any opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and began searching for a target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding astral projections were all powerful, but in the brutal Cosmic Tempestuous Battle, they could also get injured or die. Osborne needed a heavily injured, near-death one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only this way could he use the Apocalypse Bow to take the opponent down directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne found it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thousands of miles away, a Beast Clan warrior had been severely injured by a stronger opponent and was already on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately pulled back the Apocalypse Bow without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An arrow shot out at terrifying speed, instantly piercing through the Beast Clan warrior's head.</span></p><div class="pagination">
