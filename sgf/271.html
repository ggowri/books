Instead of piercing Blake's head, it only struck his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his dazed state, the intense pain made Blake scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley initially smirked, thinking he had succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Everyone, calm down! It was just a misfire! One of my men made a mistake, there is no need to panic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his voice soon froze when he realized Blake was not dead, only wounded in the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked furiously at the bodyguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard, equally bewildered, knew he had aimed at Blake's head. At such close range, missing was impossible given his marksmanship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the bullet had only hit Blake's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and wanted to shoot again, but Osborne stepped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and grabbed the bodyguard's wrist, causing excruciating pain and forcing him to drop the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Clarissa's bodyguards moved, surrounding Blake and blocking any further attempts to shoot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Wesley saw this, he became extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne faced Wesley, smirking. "Wesley, your bodyguard tried to kill Blake? Were you trying to silence him? Are you afraid of the truth he might reveal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face turned even darker, clenching his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I do not know what you are talking about! Blake is my guest, why would I kill him? Why would I fear anything he has to say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just a misfire, a mistake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed coldly, "Why do I not give your bodyguard a dose of truth serum? </span><span>Let's see if it was really a mistake or if he was following your orders to silence Blake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's expression turned to shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "What is wrong? Afraid? Do not worry, truth serum is expensive. I would not waste it on a useless pawn like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored him and strode towards Blake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blake, tell me, who sent you to frame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake said blankly, "It is Wesley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley orchestrated everything, telling me to set this trap to ruin you and make you a laughingstock in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Wesley!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, is this not like the pot calling the kettle black?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's gaze towards Wesley turned strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face was now as dark as ink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley shouted, "You are slandering me! Osborne, did you set this up? Did you plan this to frame me? This is a conspiracy against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The so-called truth serum you gave him is not real!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is still conscious and slandering me on your orders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed coldly, "Wesley, it seems you are still not giving up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then asked Blake, "Tell me, what is Wesley's relationship with the Scarlet Gang?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake immediately answered, "The biggest financial backer of the Scarlet Gang is the Ashford family. Wesley is the contact person. Thanks to Wesley's support, the Scarlet Gang has grown, monopolizing the prostitution business in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley also suggested we capture homeless women and even kidnap respectable women, forcing them into prostitution to make money for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley is a hypocritical demon!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
