  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost! Stop bothering me!" Osborne snapped impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, instead of backing off, only got more excited. "Wow, you're in such a bad mood! That means someone really did bully you! Spill it, come on, I'm dying to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should learn to talk about your frustrations. Find someone to vent to, and you'll feel better. Meanwhile, I'll hear your tragic tale, realize my life isn't so bad after all, and feel great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that a win-win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So don't go! You've got nothing better to do anyway. It's just the two of us here, so talk to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to Osborne, determined to get the truth out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, feeling a bit helpless. He casually made something up. "Just now, some woman named Monica stopped me. She claimed to be the most beautiful, most adorable girl in the entire Elf Race. I disagreed and told her that the title obviously belonged to Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And, well... I lost the argument."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he was joking, but she still wrinkled her nose and huffed. "How could you lose? That's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the most beautiful, most adorable girl in the Elf Race! That's just a fact. Who does that hag Monica think she is, comparing herself to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put on a furious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she was just trying to cheer him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Alfreda really is such a kind and sweet girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only all Elf women are like her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Peggy's icy, scornful face flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved a hand dismissively. "Alright, I feel a lot better now. Thanks for cheering me up! You should head back, Alfreda. I have some things to think about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda quieted down, then gave a small nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Rest well. And don't worry. As long as you're staying here, I won't let anyone mess with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved, watching Osborne head into the wooden lodge before skipping off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she left, her thoughts swirled. She thought, "He only went out for a bit, so why does he seem so off? Something must've happened! If he won't tell me, I'll just have to find out myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ugh, I'm a princess of the Nature Elf Royal Family, and I still have to dig for information on my own. What a disgrace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I should just leave Elf City..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea popped into her head suddenly. But in the end, she shook it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The outside world is too dangerous. I'd better stay put," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humming an old Elf song, she made her way back to her quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a mocking laugh echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Princess Alfreda. Seems like you're enjoying yourself. You got punished and sent to guard this shabby little inn, yet you still have the mood to sing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alfreda could respond, a seductive figure stepped out, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face darkened. She fixed Monica with a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you haven't learned your lesson. Are you sure you want another beating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica's expression stiffened for a second but quickly shifted back into a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "You want to hit me again? Go ahead, Princess Alfreda. Do you dare? I admit, for now, you're a little stronger than me. But so what? The Nature Elf Royal Family is already on its last legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you lay a hand on me, the Fire Elf Royal Family will retaliate. And your dear father, the king, will have to punish you to appease us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think he'll do to you next time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My guess? He'll kick you out of Elf City for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica laughed triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So? Do you dare hit me? Come on, do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a step closer, deliberately puffing out her chest, her expression full of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, Princess Alfreda, don't you think your life is pathetic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're both princesses, yet you're living worse than a common Elf. If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to even step outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been stuck managing this little inn for weeks now. How does it feel? Is it empty all the time? I bet you're lonely, sad, and regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you just apologize to me, I might be generous enough to forgive you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you could go back to your precious palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So hurry up and apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to grovel or anything. A simple bow will do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica showed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face darkened with anger. Monica's words sounded so absurd that Alfreda could barely contain herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to bow to you? To apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a cold laugh. "Monica, where do you get the nerve to say something so ridiculous? You filthy tramp. You actually came all the way here just to show off? Do you </span><span>honest</span><span>ly think I won't put you in your place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a powerful force surged from Alfreda, her fury pressing down on Monica like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica's face paled for a moment, but she quickly recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned in closer, smiling provocatively. "Oh? So angry? Then go on, hit me. Don't just put on a show. You won't scare me like that. Come on. I dare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She taunted Alfreda again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's hands clenched into fists. Her face turned red with rage. She was on the verge of losing control, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she hesitated. She knew what would happen if she attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her pause, Monica grew bolder, laughing even louder as she continued her insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the wooden lodge, Osborne sensed Alfreda's rising fury and the turbulent energy outside. Unable to ignore it, he stepped out to see what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he appeared, Monica spotted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smugness vanished. Her expression turned ice-cold. "Human? You're actually staying here? Damn it! Who allowed you to live here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected to run into Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious she was here to give Alfreda trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ignored her and turned to Alfreda instead. He could see she was shaking with rage, her face flushed with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you alright?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica, seeing that Osborne had completely disregarded her, flew into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A filthy Human like you dares ignore me?! You lowly human, I'm talking to you! Can't you hear me? How dare you rent a </span><span>place</span><span> here? Are you looking for death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already offended Prince Desmond, and now you dare provoke me too? Unlike him, I have no patience. I'll kill you right now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish, a sharp slap echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica was suddenly sent flying, crashing hard against a massive Elf tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud thud, she tumbled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air fell into silence. Her arrogant voice was finally cut off.</span></p><div class="pagination">
