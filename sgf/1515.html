  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them soared into the sky, leaving Wild Flame City behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, flying within the city was strictly prohibited; otherwise, the City Guard would be inundated with complaints and would come down hard on any offenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Hannah's power cloaking their presence, as long as they didn't fly too fast, no one would notice them. Given their urgency, they weren't about to worry too much about the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Hannah was part of the Mystic Feather Clan, one of the three major Upper Races in Wild Flame City, which came with its own set of privileges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were out of the city's range, Hannah pulled a Malevolence Airship from her Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airship expanded rapidly, quickly transforming into a magnificent vessel stretching over a hundred yards long. It was luxuriously decorated and incredibly fast, far superior to Jeffrey's Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a pang of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I get back to the Wild Flame Army, I should be promoted to centurion. Then, I'll be able to command my own Malevolence Airship! But seeing this high-end model makes the smaller, slower ones used by Wild Flame Army centurions look pretty shabby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I should look into buying a few of these top-tier airships! After all, the Spark of Blaze crew could definitely use them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he turned to Hannah. "How many Essence Crystals does this airship cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, skillfully maneuvering the airship, glanced at him with a playful smirk. "What's this? You want to buy one? It seems you've really struck gold with some ancient god's treasure trove if you're willing to spend so much Essence Crystal and still want a ship like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you had a mountain of Essence Crystals, you wouldn't be able to buy one. These airships are exclusive; only the top ten Upper Races have the privilege to purchase them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ordinary factions of the other races can't buy them, let alone the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at her words, disappointment creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah continued, "The Malevolence Airship is a creation of the Artisan Institute, and it comes in five different tiers. The most basic, the low-grade Malevolence Airship, is just 33 feet long and can carry around a hundred people. It has a maximum speed of 60 thousand miles per hour and costs about 100 thousand Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll find plenty of these among the various factions; they're a standard issue for centurions in the Wild Flame Army and the City Guard when they're on missions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there's the mid-grade Malevolence Airship, which measures 100 feet long and can accommodate about a thousand passengers. It can hit a top speed of 120 thousand miles per hour and is valued at around a million Essence Crystals. This is the workhorse for many factions, typically assigned to chiliarchs in the Wild Flame Army and City Guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the top-grade Malevolence Airship is a real marvel. At 100 yards long, it can carry around 10 thousand people and reach speeds of up to 180 thousand miles per hour, with a price tag of 10 million Essence Crystals. Even the major factions think twice before splurging on one of these, as they represent the pinnacle of what's available to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Ultimate Malevolence Airship, like the one I'm using, is on another level entirely. It stretches 300 yards long and has seven decks, holding up to 100 thousand passengers. It can reach an astonishing speed of 300 thousand miles per hour and costs a minimum of 100 million Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Artisan Institute has strict regulations&mdash;only the top ten Upper Races can even think about purchasing one, and even then, there are limits. You can't just waltz in and buy as many as you want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes the Ultimate Malevolence Airship so special isn't just its speed; it also boasts incredible defensive capabilities. Even if a group of Deity Overlord Deathborns were to attack, it could withstand their onslaught for quite a while. It could even take a hit or two from a Deity King Deathborn and still hold up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With an Ultimate Malevolence Airship, you're safe in the wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And there's something even more powerful out there&mdash;the Supreme Malevolence Airship! These can be massive, stretching up to a thousand yards long, capable of housing over a million people&mdash;like a flying city! They can still reach 300 thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When they shrink down, they save a ton of Essence Crystal and have even better defenses, making it incredibly hard for even a Deity King to breach their shields. Their speed? It can soar to over 600 thousand miles per hour! If a top-tier Deity Overlord gets locked onto by a Supreme Malevolence Airship, there's no escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, captivated. Hannah continued, "What's more, I've heard that the Supreme Malevolence Airship can even perform simple interdimensional travel! In the blink of an eye, it can enter a dimensional portal and pop up 600 thousand miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If a Deity King tries to block its path, the ship can use its interdimensional capabilities to make a quick getaway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the kicker&mdash;even the top ten Upper Races don't have the privilege to buy one. Only the Paramount Supreme Clans can own a Supreme Malevolence Airship! It's incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever come across one, do yourself a favor and run as far away as you can. Don't even think about crossing the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trust me, the consequences could be catastrophic!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
