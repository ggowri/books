  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could this happen?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were also stunned, staring around in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, at least two hundred people entered the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, now only the four of them came out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't stopped them, they wouldn't have made it out either. In the end, Osborne would have been the only one to emerge from the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and took out the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. "Adriana isn't dead, but she didn't come out! I don't know what's wrong. But I think we should go back into the Eighth Skyfall Casket to find Adriana!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne inserted the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear into the keyhole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Eighth Skyfall Casket didn't respond!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Violet-blooded Bronze Spear is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, but now it can no longer be opened. Osborne guessed that it might not be possible to open it consecutively and would require some time before it could be opened again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne had anticipated it, he still felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to open the Skyfall Casket, he couldn't bring Adriana back. He thought, "The Skyfall Casket's lid is tightly shut now; does this mean Adriana will be trapped inside forever?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't think of a solution for the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he caught a strong fragrance wafting into his nose. Instantly, he felt as if his head had been struck by a heavy blow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized that the fragrance came from the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dense Spirit-Entombing Fragrance was rapidly spreading around. Osborne's soul power was strong enough that even such a potent Spirit-Entombing Fragrance couldn't shake his Soul Current Ocean. It didn't take him long to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Clara, Leroy, and Casey all let out painful groans. Blood flowed from their mouths and noses, and their eyes turned vacant, clearly suffering severe injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Not good! When did the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance here become so dense? The three of them can't withstand it; we must leave here immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing they were about to collapse, Osborne quickly supported them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attacks from the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance were terrifying. Osborne hadn't forgotten that when they first entered Necropolis City, nearly half of their group was killed outright by the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance's Soul Attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized he must leave immediately!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't worry about finding Adriana. He truly had no choice but to pray that Adriana was safe. He quickly led them toward the distant Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Black Whirlpool was incredibly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they would only endure pain when entering; there would be no discomfort when leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned to glance at Necropolis City, the towering Celestial Spire, and the sealed Eighth Skyfall Casket below.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll be back!" he murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne led them into the Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they were thrown out from the other side of the Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, they finally caught their breath and looked at Osborne in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you saved us again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for you bringing us out, we might have died in Necropolis City! Necropolis City is just too dangerous," Clara murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "It was indeed dangerous! But maybe it's also because we're too weak! Anyway, we're safe now, but Adriana and May..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they came, there were nearly five hundred of them, but when they left, only four remained. The others all stayed behind in Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel afraid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, how do we get back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara looked at Osborne worriedly. This was outside the Black Whirlpool, and they had no idea how far it was from the Racial Convergence Planet. When they came, it was through a Level Three One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they wanted to cross the void to return to the Racial Convergence Planet, not to mention whether they could find the right direction, even if they did, they would have to fly for a very long time in the boundless starry sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Don't worry, I have a way to get back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought it was just a Level Three Cosmic Translocator, something he could build himself. Moreover, he had the coordinates of the Racial Convergence Planet, so once the Cosmic Translocator was built, they could teleport back quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne began constructing the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, under the shocked gazes of Clara, Leroy, and Casey, Osborne built a Level Three Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne immediately set the coordinates for the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We'll head back first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne activated the Cosmic Translocator. Instantly, they were enveloped in a burst of light and vanished from the teleportation array. They crossed a vast distance and appeared on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they had no idea that the moment they returned to the Racial Convergence Planet, changes were happening again in Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A spatial rift appeared near the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Figures flew out from the rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Frederick, Adriana, Callista, Weston, Quinn, Naomi, May, Mason, Brenda, and others who had already been consumed by the jungle...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They emerged one after another from the spatial rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you ruined my plan, you deserve to die!" Frederick roared angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately launched an attack on Adriana. Adriana instantly used the power of the Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves to shatter Frederick's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Frederick, it's your own weakness that kept you from breaking through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness in the Skyfall Casket. How dare you blame me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want to waste time with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly scanned the surroundings. She spotted May in the crowd but didn't see Osborne, Clara, and the others, and her expression immediately changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne and the others didn't come out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's face was filled with deep worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she had no time to think further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you're courting death! I don't know where you got a set of Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and a pair of Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves! But do you think that makes you my match?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're too naive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if your cultivation level has reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean, I can still kill you! Everyone, follow my orders and kill her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick finished angrily, and everyone around immediately launched an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and nearly forty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, all began attacking Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying attacks struck Adriana, with most of them being blocked by the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor she wore, but the remaining force was still hard for her to withstand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana let out a painful groan. She knew she couldn't take on so many people, especially with Frederick there. She wasn't even a match for Frederick alone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Adriana reached out and grabbed May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May! Let's go! Let's get out of here first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana quickly rushed toward the distant Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick didn't want to let her leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By any means, I must kill her! Destroy the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chase them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick led the chase after Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you can't escape! You ruined my plan, I must kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will never let you go!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
