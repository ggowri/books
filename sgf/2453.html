  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Brenda's words, the people around felt puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, is that really necessary?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The zone duel has ended early. Now we can't attack each other anymore! If we make a move to test him, we'll be breaking the rules! By then, the referee might even cancel our results!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! We can't make a move now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, I think there's no need to test Osborne. He's just a clown! He bet three million Sacred Crystals on himself to win the championship. I guess he's just trying to grab attention!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantom Commerce Guild's casino is professional! At the very beginning, Osborne wasn't even on the championship betting list; he insisted on adding his name!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The people at Phantom Commerce Guild believe Osborne has no chance of winning the championship. He can't possibly threaten you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was persuading Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned and explained, "I also think he can't threaten me, but we still need to test him! At least we need to know his approximate strength. Don't worry. If the person who takes action gets disqualified, I'll compensate them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, someone was drawn to her proposal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If there's compensation, then it's fine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If we take action now, we won't lose anything. On the contrary, we might gain Brenda's favor and even get closer to her...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m willing to go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a man reacted the fastest. "Anyway, my results are average, so I can't get a high ranking! I'll go test him! Even if my score gets canceled, it won't matter much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda nodded. "Alright! Then you go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. My promise won't change! You're helping me, and I won't let you suffer any loss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she gave the man an encouraging look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately became even more excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll definitely test Osborne's strength! Honestly, he's so arrogant, I've been wanting to teach him a lesson for a while!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he turned and walked toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's voice sounded from behind him. "Be careful, don't be careless! Osborne is, after all, the state duel champion of Zephyr State. He's definitely stronger than you! What you need to do is not to defeat him or teach him a lesson, but to probe his true strength as much as possible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man casually replied, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So what if he's the champion of Zephyr State? I'm still the third place in Yoresia State! The reason he could win in Zephyr State might just be because the opponents there aren't strong enough! If I went there to compete, maybe I'd be the champion...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, he was already close to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had just returned with Clara and Leroy. He glanced at the repairing Cosmic Translocator, then at Brenda and the others, without saying anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was ready to find a random spot to wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Cosmic Translocator is fixed, they can return to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, Osborne suddenly noticed a man stepping out from the crowd and heading straight toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed the man's hostility toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the man in confusion, unable to figure out why this person harbored hostility toward him. He didn't recall offending him, nor did he even know who he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy also sensed the man's hostility and whispered, "Osborne, he has animosity toward you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. Let's see what he wants to do first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Zone duel is over, so the contestants can no longer attack each other or seize the resources and treasures others have obtained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, even if he has malice toward me, he probably won't do anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne waited for the man to approach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the man walked to a spot several dozen yards away from him and glanced at him arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded lightly. "That's me. Do you need something from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man sneered, "Good! You bet nearly three million Sacred Crystals on yourself to win the championship, right? Do you think we're all so weak that you'll easily crush us to take the title?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're too arrogant and conceited!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been wanting to teach you a lesson for a long time, but you actually hid before, making it impossible for us to find you! Now that the zone duel is over, I still have to give you a good beating!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, go ahead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Osborne with a provocative expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "Are you stupid? The zone duel is already over. If a contestant attacks other participants now, it violates the rules, and their results will be disqualified!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you want to teach me a lesson, then make your move! You want me to start first? Do you think I'm as stupid as you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne not falling for it and even mocking him as stupid, the man instantly became somewhat angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, you really are arrogant and cocky! In that case, don't blame me for being rude! Even if I'm punished and disqualified today, I must teach you a harsh lesson and stand up for everyone else!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, two Sacred Artifacts appeared in front of the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The contestants participating in the zone duel are all prodigies from various states, and their strength is not weak. This man, ranked third in Yoresia State, is considered above average among all participants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combining two powers and mastering two Sacred Artifacts perfectly is fundamental.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the man held the Sacred Artifact, watching Osborne, ready to fight at any time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I'll show you that your abilities are just average! You loser!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the man made his move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda and the others in the distance were watching expectantly. On the other side, Gerald and the other judges were also watching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They've started fighting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A judge said, "Mr. Norton, should we intervene? The Zone duel is over. Their fight now violates the rules!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need! Just handle it according to standard procedures! Directly cancel the results of the one who provoked and struck first! They're all young people. As long as they're willing to bear the consequences, let them sort it out themselves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Gerald smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, the Cosmic Translocator still needs some time to be fixed. Everyone's free now! We've been battling the Magma Devourer for so long. Let's watch these youngsters fight and relax a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he finished speaking, the other judges nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who do you think will win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It should be Osborne! After all, he's the champion of Zephyr State. Although he has no chance of winning the championship, under normal circumstances, he has a shot at the top ten! His opponent probably can't beat him, but Osborne will likely have to put in some effort to win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, I think so too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I actually think Osborne might not be his match..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The judges watched their fight while whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the man's powerful attack had already reached Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In response, Osborne remained completely still.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shield suddenly appeared in front of him. It was the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the man's attack landed on the Warfare Shield and instantly dissipated, causing no harm to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already drawn the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Is this all you've got? You dare to challenge me? Who gave you the courage?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
