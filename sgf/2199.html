  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! How can your Sacred Power still be this robust? Are you just going to unleash it all without any worry of running dry?" Lord Malevolence bellowed, frustration coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply couldn't understand or accept it. Every one of Osborne's attacks was nothing short of terrifying&mdash;truly a display of overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all reasoning, such relentless assault should deplete Osborne's strength, yet he showed no signs of weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his attacks grew increasingly fierce, leaving Lord Malevolence grasping at straws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Lord Malevolence bewildered, but even the onlookers were exchanging uneasy glances, questioning the very nature of Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he keep going like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne only wore a calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should I really tell you that my Chaotic Spiritual Root lets me siphon energy from the void, restoring my Sacred Power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remarked coolly, "Lord Malevolence, I've already stated the outcome! You're done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you choose to keep struggling, then prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he released his fingers, unleashing ten arrows of Sacred Power that shot out like lightning, encircling Lord Malevolence, each arrow locking onto his form, making escape impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's face contorted in rage. "You think you can kill me? That's just wishful thinking! I won't lose! There's no way I can lose to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Malevolence Tower!" Lord Malevolence shouted with fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distant Apex divine artifact, Malevolence Tower, stirred to life and rushed to his side, emitting a powerful protective barrier that shielded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten arrows slammed into the barrier, the impact causing it to tremble violently. Cracks appeared, splintering across its surface until it eventually shattered. But even as the last vestiges of the Sacred Power arrows struck Lord Malevolence directly, inflicting considerable pain, it wasn't enough to finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Malevolence Tower activated its defenses again, veiling him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence erupted into laughter. "Hahaha! Osborne, you can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Malevolence Tower is the finest Apex divine artifact in the cosmos, far superior to your Sanctum of Night! Its defenses are impenetrable! So what if your Bloodwrought Bow is a quasi-Sacred Artifact? Your cultivation level is too low to break through the Malevolence Tower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't kill me. I'm invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the protection of the tower, confidence surged through him. He quickly pulled out a dazzling crystal, frantically siphoning its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Sacred Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he absorbed its energy, the once-weak aura surrounding Lord Malevolence grew vibrant again. Even the cracked Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn and Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn began to glow, the cracks </span><span>remaining</span><span> but now shimmering with renewed strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence sneered and said, "Osborne, just wait! Once I'm back to my peak, and my horns fully healed, I'll defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne's expression turned icy. "You think you can heal up and come at me again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, you won't get that chance! Do you really believe that hiding behind the Malevolence Tower puts you out of my reach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such naivety!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pulled back his Bloodwrought Bow once more. This time, arrows filled the string, gleaming ominously under the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's heart raced, but he quickly collected himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a chilling laugh, channeling even more power into the Malevolence Tower, reinforcing his defenses and continuing his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrage of Sacred Power arrows rained down on Malevolence Tower, each impact echoing like thunder, causing the massive structure to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the onslaught, the defenses of Malevolence Tower held firm. Even as the arrows broke through, a second and then a third layer of protection sprang up in rapid succession, absorbing the brunt of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne's fierce assault was thwarted, leaving Lord Malevolence unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he felt his energy signature strengthening as he rapidly recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a formidable Malevolence Tower! Its defenses truly live up to its reputation as a top-tier Apex divine artifact&mdash;it's practically on par with a quasi-Sacred Artifact! My cultivation level is still too low; even with the Bloodwrought Bow at my side, I can't completely destroy Malevolence Tower, let alone take down Lord Malevolence while he's being shielded by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy is really a tough nut to crack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Osborne declared, "But let me remind you, hiding behind the Malevolence Tower doesn't make you safe! You think you can just relax and recover with that thing protecting you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm going to smash your little turtle shell to pieces! I'll shatter your Malevolence Tower for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Osborne called out, "Ascending Sacred Sanctum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Smash it to bits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful hum filled the air as the Ascending Sacred Sanctum materialized, radiating a brilliant purple light. Without hesitation, it surged forward, crashing into Malevolence Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's expression soured as he narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he took in the battered state of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, a smirk crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A dilapidated temple thinks it can take on my Malevolence Tower? How laughable! Is that your new toy? Hahaha! It's even worse off than the Sanctum of Night! There's no way it can stand up to my Malevolence Tower! "Just wait for it to fall apart..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence returned to absorbing the Sacred Crystal's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum approached Malevolence Tower, its size dwarfed by the massive structure. To anyone watching, it looked like a tiny rabbit charging at a ferocious tiger, a comically mismatched confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum's shabby appearance only added to the absurdity; it seemed ready to crumble at the slightest touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the odds, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum collided with Malevolence Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening sound reverberated through the air, and everyone watched in shock as the towering defenses of Malevolence Tower crumpled under the impact, as if made of mere paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battered Ascending Sacred Sanctum surged forward, penetrating deep into the heart of Malevolence Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see that something had collapsed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an astonishing turn of events, it was not the fragile Ascending Sacred Sanctum that shattered but Malevolence Tower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a powerful bullet, the Sanctum pierced through the seemingly indestructible tower, which crumbled as easily as flesh under a hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Malevolence Tower collapsed, reduced to a shower of debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the impact sent Lord Malevolence reeling, blood spewing from his mouth as he was violently thrown to the ground.</span></p><div class="pagination">
