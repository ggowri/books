  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared at Osborne, her eyes wide with shock. "What?! You offended Prince Desmond?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that why you're not worried about making Monica angry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you have to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You realize if I take you in, I'll be crossing Desmond's path too, right? If my father finds out, he might just flay me alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, she wasn't kicking Osborne out; instead, she wore a resigned expression. "Fine, maybe it's best if you stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already taken your Miracle Elixir</span><span>s</span><span>! And honestly, you've got a point&mdash;since I've already ticked one off, what's one more? We might as well stick together for warmth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But listen, if Desmond shows up here looking for trouble, don't you dare expect me to help you! I can't afford any more trouble&mdash;my father will seriously lose it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may be the daughter of the Nature Elf Clan's king, a member of the Royal Family, and while Monica and Desmond might not like me, they wouldn't dare kill me! Plus, they probably can't even take me in a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now as for you, that's up to you to figure out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Don't worry; if Desmond really comes after me, I won't ask for your help! But what about Monica? If she comes for me, what then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda froze. "Uh, if Monica comes looking for you, what does that have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it has to do with you! I'm renting a treehouse here because I felt sorry for you, and now if I end up pissing off Monica for it, you're going to help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda blinked, her thoughts racing as she considered his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, with a sigh, she relented. "Alright, if Monica gives you trouble, I'll back you up! But I have a feeling I'm just inviting more chaos into my life. If you hadn't come here, it's like she wouldn't have bothered me at all&mdash;I could've been living in peace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever! If she dares come after you, we'll take her on together! Worst case, we'll just bolt from this lousy Elf City for good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I become a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness, I'll deal with the lot of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feigned a menacing gesture with her arms, her cuteness shining through as she mimicked grabbing Monica by the collar and delivering a solid smack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, Alfreda was still a princess of the Nature Elf Clan&mdash;surely Desmond and Monica wouldn't go too hard on him, would they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he made a quick exit when needed, he could dodge any trouble that came his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've gotta find a way to level up my skills fast!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, do you know how to quickly improve one's abilities or cultivation level?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked taken aback for a moment but then settled into a calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I know! Everyone in Elf City knows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Really? Can you share that info with me? I'll give you another Miracle Elixir in return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out a Miracle Elixir, showcasing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with excitement as she took it eagerly. "To quickly boost your strength and abilities, you just need Sacred Crystals and Sacred Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Crystals and Sacred Elixirs?" Osborne echoed, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! They're the upgraded versions of Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs! With Sacred Crystals and Sacred Elixirs, your levels can skyrocket! And Element Gold Crystals are also great&mdash;they can enhance your elemental essence in no time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't forget Soul of Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the real deal&mdash;boosts your Divine Body level and can even break the limits to transform it into Infinite Sacred Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes sparkled with excitement as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but mirror her enthusiasm. "Soul of Umbra Earth? Element Gold Crystal? And the Sacred Crystal and Sacred Elixir? Where can we find these treasures?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed lightly, shaking her head, "If I knew exactly where to get them, I'd have already gone and snatched them up myself! I'm only at Ascension Five, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Osborne felt a bit embarrassed, scratching his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't asking for specific locations. I meant, how do you actually get your hands on these treasures? Is it just a game of luck in deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said, her mood brightening, "Well, not exactly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me break it down for you. Whether it's the Soul of Umbra Earth, Sacred Crystals, Sacred Elixirs, or Element Gold Crystals, they typically only exist above Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you can find Umbra Earth, you've got a shot at these treasures!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, once Umbra Earth collapses, those treasures will scatter and drift throughout deep space. So, yes, you could stumble upon them by chance, but the odds are slim!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, I've never had any luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Generally speaking, your best bet is to find Umbra Earth, where the chances of getting these goodies are much higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Umbra Earth?!" Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued. It was another term he'd never heard before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you're not familiar with Umbra Earth," Alfreda said, and he nodded in confirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Umbra Earth is soil that drifts over from Umbra World! These fragments can vary in size&mdash;some are as small as a clump, while others are as large as continents or even planets! They float around in deep space, packed with treasures from Umbra World!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those treasures include, but aren't limited to, the Soul of Umbra Earth, Sacred Crystals, Sacred Elixirs, and Element Gold Crystals! There are also plenty of Apex divine artifacts and even Sacred Artifacts...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, Umbra Earth is a treasure trove!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's also incredibly dangerous! There are strange rules governing it, and one misstep could cost you your life! Some of the larger Umbra Earths even host formidable beings from Umbra World!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These beings are terribly strong! Countless explorers have met their end in the Umbra Earth, never to be seen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression turned serious, a hint of fear flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Umbra Earth is definitely the most perilous spot in deep space! Each one has its own set of rules and dangers, so past experiences won't help you at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For instance, recently near Elf City, a sizable Umbra Earth has appeared, resembling a small planet, and it might hold the Soul of Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the rules of this particular Umbra Earth only allow the younger generation&mdash;those who have been cultivating for less than three hundred years&mdash;to enter! Anyone older than that will instantly explode upon arrival!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every Royal Family among the elves has sent their young warriors to explore this Umbra Earth, but the losses have been significant, and they haven't found much in the way of rewards!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, the royal families won't give up on exploring this Umbra Earth! They'll keep recruiting young warriors to venture there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no doubt that treasures capable of rapidly enhancing cultivation levels and strength are hidden within that Umbra Earth!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
