  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A day later, the defense system was finally installed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Radcliffe family approved the installation, the transaction would be complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The equipment that Osborne had purchased had also been delivered. Under Valentin's arrangement, the members of Skyefall Security were fully re-equipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security's strength greatly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, the defense system has been installed and debugged. You can arrange for someone to test it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This defense system incorporates a lot of high-tech from the Draco Group. It doesn't need any human operation to withstand attacks from Class B powerhouses. If operated by professionals, just two squads on rotation, each with four members, can withstand attacks from Class B+ powerhouses for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, it can withstand anything below Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin confidently introduced it to Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's eyes lit up. "Is it really that powerful? Even without human operation, can it withstand Class B powerhouses? With operators, it can even withstand a group of Class B+ powerhouses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "You can find someone to test it. I believe you trust Skyefall Security's reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded, then felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't even find a Class B powerhouse to test it, let alone a Class B+ one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna herself was only at the Class C+ level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a moment, then looked at Osborne. "Osborne, how about we test it together? Even if we're not quite at the Class B level, we should be close enough to test the system's capabilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a warning message came through his earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne told Donna, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, Apollo is here. He's brought many men with him, and there might be a fierce battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned, worriedly looking at Valentin. "Mr. Gibson, maybe we should postpone the testing. Why don't you take a break first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't want Valentin to meet Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She already knew about the Chevalier family's acquisition of Horizon Security, renaming it Chevalier Security, and their subsequent heavy squeeze on Skyefall Security, poaching their bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to get involved in the business rivalry between Apollo and Valentin, fearing that if they met, they might fight again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin didn't answer but looked at Osborne instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne subtly shook his head, and Valentin then said with a smile, "No need. Apollo wants to squeeze Skyefall Security, and I haven't countered yet. If I avoid him now, people will think I'm afraid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo's strength is at the Class B level. Let him test this defense system for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was shocked. "What? Apollo's strength is Class B?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression turned serious, but thinking that Apollo could test the defense system, her eyes lit up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, has the system been activated?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled calmly, "Not yet. But as soon as you order, the system can be activated immediately. Anyone not on the whitelist who enters the area will be detected, warned, blocked, attacked, or even killed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then activate the system. I want to see if it can withstand Apollo's forced entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, if your system stops him, I will pay the balance immediately. If not, then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin said confidently, "If it can't stop him, I won't take a penny. Let's go to the monitoring room to watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the group arrived at the monitoring room. Dozens of large screens projected every corner of the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Clarissa also hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, a large convoy appeared at the entrance of the Radcliffe Manor. Apollo, with dozens of burly men, prepared to enter the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These dozens of burly men were not from the Enforcement Team. They wore uniform clothes with a fierce tiger embroidered on the chest, which was the family emblem of the Chevalier family. Below the tiger, there was a small line saying Chevalier Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men were all experts&nbsp;from Chevalier Security, each exuding a powerful aura, almost armed to the teeth with extremely advanced equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn couldn't help but frown at this sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo brought so many fully armed men here. What does he want to do? Is he here to show off his might?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna also frowned, snorting coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inform Apollo that Clarissa is feeling unwell and cannot receive him today. Ask him to visit tomorrow. He definitely won't leave and will force his way in with his men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, several of her subordinates nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Apollo received the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo snorted coldly, "Who dares to refuse my visit? Since you won't come to greet me, I'll force my way in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he led his men into the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
