  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's expression soured upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can kill us? You're dreaming! You won't live long enough. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will ensure you die miserably."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I've heard those words too many times. When I was just Class B, a Count Medusa said the same. Then a Marquis Medusa echoed it, and now you, a Duke, are saying it too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm still alive and well, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may be powerful, but you can't catch me! When I grow stronger, I'll come for you, and I'll smash your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne stepped back toward the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because at this moment, he sensed several powerful auras approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These auras were no weaker than that of Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was surrounded by these people, he would have absolutely no chance of escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Medusa saw Osborne was about to leave, she became furious. She sensed her companions were closing in. In just a few moments, Osborne would be surrounded by them and have no chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, how could she be willing to let Osborne leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes blazed with intent to petrify him, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Wait for me. None of you can escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he vanished, leaving Duke Medusa unable to sense his location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, several imposing figures appeared beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke Medusa No. 6, where is that little bug? Didn't you lock him down?" A loud voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who spoke was a Titan. His body was so huge, at least 33 feet tall, resembling a Tyrannosaurus Rex with rough skin and a menacing face. His feet were like two pillars and his fists were like a big stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just looking at him, one could feel the strong pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa No. 6 shot him a cold glance. "Duke Titan No. 7, are you questioning me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your fault for arriving late. That damned bug has escaped. He has a special power and eliminated my Medusa Mark. I can't sense him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's at least 30 miles away. We can no longer pursue him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan No. 7's expression darkened. "You let a little bug run away? You're useless! How can you follow the great The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa No. 6 bristled. "Duke Titan No. 7, are you looking for a fight? I'll turn </span><span>you into stone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm afraid of you? I'll crush you!" Duke Titan No. 7 said coldly without showing any weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, stop arguing." A massive black wolf spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Duke Werewolf No. 9!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What we need to do now is to quickly capture that little bug! He attacked two rare metal mines and killed six Marquises and a dozen Counts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Vampire No. 8 added, "We must find and tear him apart! He's only at Class AA, but very strong. Marquises and Counts won't be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only we dukes can kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Tauren No. 7 said, "We must act quickly. We must find him even if we turn </span><span>Dampston</span><span> upside down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, the five suddenly fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all wanted to kill Osborne, but he had already escaped. How could they find him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll likely attack the rare metal mines again or even the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters! Our best bet is to ambush him," Duke Vampire No. 8 suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!" Duke Medusa No. 7 nodded. "He has spatial powers. Even if we can find him, we may not be able to catch him. The only way is to set a trap and let him fall into it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can request an ancient magic weapon that can freeze space. If he dares to show up, he won't escape and will surely die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five Dukes of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> reached a consensus and began planning a trap for Osborne, waiting for him to take the bait.</span></p><div class="pagination">
