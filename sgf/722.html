  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax? Don't resist?" Emma murmured, her body still tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't quite understand why she should let go, but she decided to follow Osborne's advice and tried to ease herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Emma felt her emotions settle, and her stiff body began to loosen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a slight smile, "Good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's still not enough. Right now, you're just physically relaxed. I need you to let go completely, both body and mind, and trust me entirely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do I have to do that?" Emma finally voiced her confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had anticipated this question and answered without hesitation, "Because this is your first time, and I want it to be perfect. I want you to look back on it later with nothing but happiness, without any regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shivered at his words and nodded. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, close your eyes and empty your mind. You have to trust me completely. If you can't do that, then we can't even talk about love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't respond but focused on clearing her mind. Soon, Osborne noticed that she had entered a special state, her body and spirit completely at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, if Osborne had wanted to harm Emma, she wouldn't have been able to react at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her in this state filled him with mixed emotions&mdash;he was both happy and troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Happy because his plan was working flawlessly; if Osborne wanted to unleash a mental attack and manipulate Emma's memories, it would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But troubled because Emma actually trusted him this much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of harming someone so trusting made Osborne's heart heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth but resolved to proceed with his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Emma completely defenseless, Osborne knew what he had to do next: alter her memories, change how she felt about him, and reshape her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be easy, but it was the only solution he could think of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, crafting a brand-new memory for Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he had to do was overwrite her memories of today, and everything would be sorted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, open your eyes," Osborne instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma slowly opened her eyes, filled with anticipation, excitement, and a hint of shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what met her gaze was Osborne's cold Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, she froze, confusion flickering across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could react, the power of Satan's Eye exploded forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne unleashed the carefully constructed memory into Emma's mind. It was a complex wave of mental strength designed not to harm her but to alter her memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, everything went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was his first time executing such a unique mental attack, Osborne could clearly sense that he was successfully manipulating Emma's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could twist, modify, or erase them at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like wielding divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just when Osborne thought everything was going to end smoothly, a terrifying force surged within Emma's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment this power appeared, it shattered Osborne's mental assault, not only dispersing it but also reversing its flow back into his own mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood, his vision swimming with stars. It felt like his brain had been hammered a hundred times, and his very soul was on the verge of shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even have time to react before his body collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a mask of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul was so battered that he could barely keep his mind clear. The fact that he hadn't passed out yet was a testament to his mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Emma seemed to snap back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She appeared unaffected by the situation, her gaze fixed on Osborne with a strange intensity. "Osborne, you're not keeping your word! You were trying to use the special energy of Satan's Eye to tamper with my memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You almost succeeded! If you had, I'd have forgotten everything about today, right? I would even forget my desire to unlock Satan's Eye and my feelings for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes suddenly welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this? Why are you so selfish? I admit I don't know how to love someone properly, and maybe I've overstepped my bounds, but after more than twenty years, I've finally developed feelings for a man. How dare you take that away from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being outrageous!" Emma shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's mind was still buzzing with the aftermath, leaving him unable to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma then suddenly smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you're not going to die. It's just a temporary soul injury. You'll recover in a few days. You fool, did you really think that since Satan's Eye can control memories, there wouldn't be any safeguards against it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
