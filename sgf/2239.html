  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Adriana's intense stare, Osborne was filled with a sense of indecision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the top-notch super warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could become her disciple, even just a nominal one, he could bypass numerous obstacles and speed up his growth by leaps and bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, being in Adriana's sphere of influence would allow him to stay close to Isa, Clarissa, and the others for a long time without being separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the generous offer, Ms. Alba! I'm used to my free-spirited ways and don't want to be restricted. I'd rather not let you down, so I'll have to decline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left Angela and her fellow practitioners </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne just turned down Ms. Alba!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he even know what he's missing out on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he realize how hard-to-come-by it is to be a registered disciple of Adriana? Even Empyrean Sacredness warriors would fight like hell for this opportunity, and he just walked away from it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy's </span><span>gonna</span><span> live to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's lost his marbles! Passing up the chance to be Ms. Alba's registered disciple! If it were me, I'd jump at it without a second thought, no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber said, "Sure, he's an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King at the moment, and his strength is on par with Clarissa and Emma. But it won't be long before they leave him in the dust. Isa... she'll reach a whole new level that he'll never be able to catch up with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Anastasia and Zoe will quickly close the gap and leave him in their wake for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By turning down Ms. Alba, he's basically throwing away his future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and her practitioners shook their heads in disbelief, convinced that Osborne would come to regret his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana, taken aback by his refusal, didn't push the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and said, "I respect your choice! But I hope you won't breathe a word about their talents to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly gave his assurance. "Don't worry, Ms. Alba! My lips are sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to ask you to look after them well and teach them diligently. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne bowed deeply to Adriana, his face solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Clarissa, and the others were deeply touched as they watched him bow to Adriana, asking her to take good care of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes welled up with tears, and they were filled with a sense of reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed them a smile and waved. "It's time for you to go! Head to the Fairy Moon Sect with Ms. Alba! That's where you'll really make your mark! Take good care of yourselves and don't worry about me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be here waiting for all of you to level up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're all big shots on the Racial Convergence Planet, don't forget about me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm relying on you guys to have my back when you're famous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made their eyes redden even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they stepped forward and hugged Osborne tightly, holding on to him sorrowfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Adriana could sense the strong bond among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top-notch super warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet, she kept quiet and patiently waited as they bid each other farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her thoughts, she knew this separation might mean they wouldn't see each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they did meet again, they might be in different leagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under her guidance, Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others would level up quickly and soon become the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of warriors on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, by refusing the chance to be her registered disciple, he wouldn't exactly fall into obscurity, but there was no way he could keep up with Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in their strengths would widen in a flash, and he'd be left in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the strength gap got too wide, even the closest of relationships could turn into faded memories, with no room left for a real connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Adriana didn't understand why Osborne had turned down her offer, she couldn't help thinking he'd made a bone-headed decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take good care of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go looking for women out there! Wait for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay safe, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure to drop by the Fairy Moon Sect whenever you can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, they hugged him and said their goodbyes, their eyes shiny with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his own eyes start to water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The farewell weighed heavily on his heart, but deep down, Osborne knew what was really bothering him&mdash;he just wasn't strong enough. If he had the kind of power Adriana had, he could have guided them himself, and they wouldn't have to part ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, swallowing back the surge of sorrow as he waved his hand. "Alright, let's get going! Don't keep Ms. Alba waiting! Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine! And I promise I'll swing by the Fairy Moon Sect whenever I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I find out you're slacking off or your progress is lagging, I won't cut you any slack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell quiet, just staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana chimed in, her voice firm, "Okay, it's time to move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This short-term separation is just a stepping-stone to a longer reunion down the road. As long as you all live up to my strength expectations, I'll make sure you can leave the Fairy Moon Sect to meet up with Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's make our way back to the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, the sadness in their eyes grew deeper, but they had no choice but to turn around and slowly shuffle over to Adriana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in their eyes and trickled down their cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to keep his emotions in check as he waved </span><span>goodbye to</span><span> </span><span>Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, and Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!" Adriana didn't waste a single moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful energy wrapped around them, and mysterious patterns materialized in the air, giving rise to a colossal Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft hum, in the blink of an eye, they were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt as if all his energy had been sapped away. He stood there, in a daze, his eyes fixed on the spot where they'd just been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela walked up and gave his shoulder a gentle pat. "Having second thoughts about your decision?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel how much you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> miss them! But why didn't you want to go with Ms. Alba to the Fairy Moon Sect? Why not stick with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped out of his reverie at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, not keen on explaining. All that filled his mind was the fact that he was now here alone among those who'd come to the Racial Convergence Planet with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of sadness washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only console himself with the idea that this brief separation was for the sake of a more wonderful reunion down the road. It was the best-case scenario he could envision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne managed a forced smile. "I'm good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, from now on, I'll be an inner disciple at Peak Seven of the Mystic Sirius Sect. So, I'm counting on you to watch my back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared at him, her expression pensive and solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of silence, she finally nodded. "Don't fret; they'll be in safe hands at the Fairy Moon Sect! As for you... I'll be training at the Mystic Sirius Sect for a while. If you ever get into a bind, just come and find me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took out a token. "This is my Peak Lord Token. With this, you can drop by my place whenever you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After handing it over to him, Angela disappeared in a flash.</span></p><div class="pagination">
