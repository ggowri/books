  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Through the long, dim corridor, Osborne entered the Maelstrom Boxing Club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the center of the club was an octagon cage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inside the cage, two brawny men were fiercely fighting, their faces covered in blood. One man&rsquo;s arm had just been broken by his opponent, and he screamed in agony, but the fight continued. He bit his opponent&rsquo;s ear, tearing it off. The opponent also screamed in pain and furiously punched his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hundreds of spectators surrounded the cage, watching the bloody fight with excitement, shouting frantically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Kill him! Kill him now!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it, grab his eyes! If you make me lose money, I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Bite his neck!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Trash!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The audience&rsquo;s frenzied shouts and the bloody battle in the cage made the underground fight club&rsquo;s atmosphere extremely intense, leaving Osborne, who had never seen such a scene before, a bit taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No wonder the Maelstrom doesn&rsquo;t allow recording devices in here. These bloody matches would definitely make ordinary people nauseous if they were uploaded online. What a bloody and cruel place.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The fight in the cage ended with one of the men being beaten to death. His body was quickly dragged away, and the surviving man roared in excitement, as he would receive a large sum of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The spectators who won money cheered excitedly, while those who lost cursed wildly. The second bloody match began soon after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These fighters weren&rsquo;t very strong. Even an F-rank martial artist could easily defeat them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But they fought like beasts, risking their lives, with blood splattering everywhere, stimulating the audience&rsquo;s adrenaline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne watched for a while before looking away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn&rsquo;t forgotten his purpose for being here. He activated the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to find Davy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He saw at least dozens of Maelstrom members scattered around the club, maintaining order with weapons at their waists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he didn&rsquo;t find Davy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned and finally looked towards the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A group of Maelstrom members guarded the stairs leading to the second floor, not allowing anyone to approach. Osborne thought that since Davy was the leader, he was likely upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough, Osborne quickly locked onto his target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a private room on the second floor, a burly figure was sitting on a sofa with a beautiful woman in his arms. He had a cigar in his mouth and his hand up the woman&rsquo;s skirt, talking to his subordinates behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man was indeed Davy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne recognized his face and confirmed he was the one in contact with Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Finally found you,&rdquo; Osborne murmured, taking the button from his lapel and splitting it into a miniature camera and an earpiece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He put the earpiece in his ear and used the ocular energy of the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to control the mini camera, silently sending it towards the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The nail-sized camera was unnoticeable in the dim environment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly maneuvered it to the second floor and into Davy&rsquo;s private room through the door gap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, Osborne&rsquo;s earpiece transmitted the woman&rsquo;s moans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Boss, no, please, no. Don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman&rsquo;s moans made Osborne speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, after a burst of intense screams, the moans stopped. Davy waved his hand, and the woman left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of his subordinates spoke, &ldquo;Mr. Jones, Justin Caldwell is here again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked to hear this through his earpiece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin Caldwell was here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did Justin have connections with Davy too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hadn&rsquo;t forgotten that Justin had recently hired Milo to kill him, and Milo was a killer from the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect an unexpected gain today. Milo is with the Aberrants, and the ones who attacked Clarissa are from the Aberrants too. Paul is connected with Davy, and Justin is also connected with him. This can&rsquo;t be a coincidence.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up, and he continued to eavesdrop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy smoked his cigar and said calmly, &ldquo;What does Justin want? Never mind, let him in. After all, he&rsquo;s a young master of a wealthy family and useful to us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The subordinate nodded and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, a haggard-looking Justin was brought into the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy greeted him with a smile. &ldquo;Mr. Caldwell, welcome.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin urgently asked, &ldquo;Mr. Jones, have you heard from Milo?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy replied with a smile, &ldquo;Mr. Caldwell, Milo is a C-rank killer of the Aberrants, and I&rsquo;m just a liaison. Why would he contact me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin frowned. &ldquo;Mr. Jones, I suspect Milo is in trouble. I sent him to kill that loser Osborne, but Milo disappeared, and Osborne is still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you think Osborne killed Milo?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And can you help me contact another killer? I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep well these days. As long as Osborne is alive, I can&rsquo;t rest easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That loser must be dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how much it costs.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
