  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the heat of battle, Osborne wielded but two trump cards: the Breath of Celestial and the formidable Thunder Explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, a third lurked in the shadows, the Death Sickle, an ancient magic weapon forged in the image of the legendary weapon of the Grim Reaper and a trophy from his victory over Chris, a disciple of the King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Death Sickle, capable of severing souls and amplifying mental assaults, helped promise Osborne an easy victory over Sam and Rodney, even in the face of their combined might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alas, it remained trapped in the Dimensional Space, inaccessible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Osborne was reluctant to reveal its existence, so he kept it shrouded in secrecy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne mused, "Better to unveil the Thunder Explosion than the Death Sickle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With resolve hardening his gaze, Osborne took action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes danced between his foes, finally settling on Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's defenses were impenetrable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In contrast, Rodney presented a softer target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still grappling with the nuances of his newly mastered Thunder Explosion, Osborne harbored doubts about its potency against Sam's fortifications. The thought of failing to inflict significant damage on Sam, potentially leaving himself exposed, weighed heavily on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney yelled, "Osborne, cease your futile struggle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sam and I stand as equals of the Class AA, while you're at Class A+. Your prowess under our siege is commendable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if we allow you to ascend to Class AA, we may no longer match your might. Alas, today is not the day for your ascension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hand over the Heir's Emblem and spare yourself further harm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney kept persuading Osborne to hand over the badge of the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney sought not to squander his energy in this skirmish but to conserve it for the inevitable confrontation with Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, "Futile struggle? The day's victor will only be me. And you, Rodney, will soon be history."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney sneered, "Boasting on the brink of defeat? Your tricks are laid bare; you stand no chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Behold my final gambit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's voice thundered as he unleashed his Thunder Power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sky above the Lostridge Mountains transformed in an instant, dark clouds billowing forth to blot out the sun and casting a shadow over the verdant peaks. Within these tempestuous clouds, lightning danced with an unnatural ferocity. This was no mere storm; it was the mutated lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After killing Alexander and taking away his body, Osborne employed Satan's Eye to absorb the elemental essence of Alexander's lightning elemental when other eyes were averted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, the lightning elemental of Osborne also mutated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, his power had been mutated further, even surpassing Alexander's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mutated Thunder Power?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam and Rodney's expressions shifted, a mix of surprise and caution etching their features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We grew accustomed to your mastery over spatial power and martial arts, underestimating the depth of your other talents. But we did not anticipate your mastery over Thunder Power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you believe this display of power will be enough to tip the scales in your favor? Dream on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They showed great disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne silently directed his Thunder Power, unleashing a barrage that rained down upon Sam and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air crackled, and thunder roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam and Rodney deflected the relentless assault with ease. Relying on their AA-level fortitude, despite the mutated thunders forcing them to muster their strength, they still could manage the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne's control over the thunder intensified, Sam and Rodney observed with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They firmly viewed Osborne's efforts as futile, a desperate flailing before the inevitable conclusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unbeknownst to them, beneath the veil of this relentless onslaught, a thunderball gathered in Osborne's palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Its core was soon pulsating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This thunderball was predominantly a deep, regal purple, but within its depths danced flecks of gold, moving with a frenetic energy that hinted at the devastating force contained within.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could feel a tempest eager to be unleashed from the ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam and Rodney belatedly sensed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They felt the impending doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through the veil of relentless thunder, they finally glanced at Osborne. The purple-gold thunderball cradled in his palm shocked them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thunder Power! That's his true power! And he has actually mastered the intermediate application of Thunder Power! Run away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, "Run away? There is no sanctuary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Behold the true might of thunder and lightning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thunder Explosion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thunderball erupted forth in a split second. Despite its rounded form, its velocity rivaled the swiftness of ordinary lightning, hurtling towards Rodney with an instantaneous force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's face was contorting with ferocity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't foreseen that Osborne would target him. He could no longer evade and was forced to hastily mobilize energy to shield his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simultaneously, he drew a defensive ancient magic weapon from his sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Energy surged from the weapon, enveloping him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the thunderball detonated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fearsome purple-gold lightning erupted wildly and emitted a dreadful roar, instantaneously enveloping Rodney and shattering his defensive ancient magic weapon. His energy shield was breaching. His body was striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A piercing scream rang out abruptly, only to fade swiftly.</p><div class="pagination">
