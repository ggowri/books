  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had his own plans to boost the Augustine family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously tasked his intelligence department with investigating the gathering of Ferocious Beasts within Rosmandi, preparing to take matters into his own hands and eliminate any potential Beast Tide threats lurking in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, the Augustine family in Newport City would gain significant prestige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his true aim was to attract more metahuman talents to the Draco Armed Services Branch, ultimately strengthening their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, before he could put his plan into action, Hearin City was struck by a Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Deschanel family was executing their strategy with far greater cunning&mdash;and cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They allowed the Beast Tide to wreak havoc across a large portion of Hearin City, resulting in the deaths of over a million innocent lives. Only then did they step in, presenting themselves as the saviors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This calculated move ensured that the confused populace would be filled with gratitude and admiration for the Deschanel family, propelling their reputation to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this reputation was soaked in blood, and Osborne scoffed at such tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, as the Deschanel family engaged in battle, the ordinary citizens of Hearin City had already forgotten who had initially stood against the Beast Tide&mdash;the twelve Ancient Families, the dozens of wealthy factions, and the hundreds of thousands of metahumans who had risked their lives to protect the city, not to mention the Augustine family from Newport City that had rushed in from miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everyone believed it was the Deschanel family that had saved Hearin City, that they were the true heroes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the battle between Joseph and the three Dark Deities was not going well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Joseph was slightly stronger than any single Dark Deity, being outnumbered three to one put him at a serious disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget about defeating the trio&mdash;his main goal was simply to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was equally dire for the Deschanel family warriors trying to hold back the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, the Deschanel family had concealed their true power, which could now easily be considered the strongest in Rosmandi. They boasted more than three thousand Class S warriors and nearly all members of the Deschanel family possessed Class A strength or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family was formidable, but against a million-strong Beast Tide, even their elite warriors were struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the tidal wave of beasts were seven thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they still holding back?" Osborne murmured, his eyes fixed on the Deschanel family's sanctuary, waiting for the other deities within to make their appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, Joseph alone couldn't handle three Dark Deities, and the Deschanel family warriors were barely managing against the Beast Tide. If the Deschanel family wanted to solidify their newfound reputation, they needed to decisively defeat the Dark Deities and the Beast Tide, showcasing their immense strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they failed, the prestige they had gained would be nothing more than a mirage&mdash;an illusion that would evaporate under scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was certain that the other deities of the Deschanel family would have to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the opportunity he had been waiting for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope they all step up," he whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the citizens of Hearin City began to notice that Joseph and the Deschanel family warriors were struggling against the Dark Deities and the relentless Beast Tide. Whispers of concern rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought the Deschanel family were our saviors? Weren't they supposed to protect Hearin City and all of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like the Deschanel family can't hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we all going to die after all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers rippled through the crowd, their earlier gratitude and admiration for the Deschanel family melting away, replaced by fear and uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the crowd, some members of the Deschanel family hid, smirking coldly, not the least bit worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One person muttered, "The Deschanel family seems to be failing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement quickly found agreement among others nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the words left his mouth, a sudden burst of brilliant light erupted from the direction of the Deschanel Estate. Over thirty powerful auras, so overwhelming that they took the breath away of every citizen in Hearin City, flooded the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty figures, each emanating god-like power, descended like divine soldiers, appearing on the battlefield in a breathtaking display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abominations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare invade the Deschanel family's territory and slaughter the citizens we protect? You are all condemned to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Deschanel family gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, more than thirty divine warriors of the Deschanel family joined the fray, unleashing devastating attacks that turned the tide of the battle within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Dark Deities? The Beast Tide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of these divine warriors, they were nothing but dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ordinary citizens of Hearin City stood frozen, and their eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family had over thirty divine warriors! This was earth-shattering news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their awe, gratitude, and reverence for the Deschanel family reached its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the thirty Deschanel family divine warriors appeared, Osborne's eyes lit up, and he vanished from his spot like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His target was the Deschanel family's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family had grown too powerful. With over thirty divine warriors, their ambition to rule Rosmandi meant that the Augustine family of Newport City would be their first target.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew he had to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;to buy some time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
