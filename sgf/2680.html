  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Osborne possibly be satisfied?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current physical strength, the intimate activities he had with Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita were merely a warm-up for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just as he finished warming up, the five of them were already begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of pity for their bodies, Osborne wouldn't torment them recklessly and could only forcibly suppress his desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was also why his body reacted so quickly after being pushed down by Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a surge of desire completely ignited by Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of strength and physical endurance, Adriana was far superior to Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita. Osborne could finally let loose without worrying about Adriana being unable to handle it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, in the room, Adriana's joyful moans grew more intense and excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, she imitated Isa, trying to be on top of Osborne. But gradually, she was pressed beneath him, submissively responding to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, the battle between Osborne and Adriana finally came to a halt, and even Adriana was too exhausted to lift her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of strength and cultivation level, she is now stronger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in terms of physical strength alone, she is not even half as strong as Osborne. After all, the Human Community is naturally physically weak. It was only by absorbing a trace of Primordial Energy that Osborne's physical strength skyrocketed to its current level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of physical strength alone, even a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level in the Human Community would definitely be no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Adriana was already exhausted, while Osborne was still full of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His fingers gently traced over Adriana's soft, ample chest, then softly kneaded it, making the closed-eyed Adriana let out an incredibly comfortable sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it. I'm too tired. Your body is like a beast. I feel more exhausted than fighting an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior," Adriana said coquettishly, swatting away Osborne's mischievous hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, driven by desire, he felt nothing and only wanted to vent his lust on Adriana. But after calming down, he couldn't help feeling embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He truly never thought about having such a relationship with Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what's done is done. Osborne wouldn't regret it, nor would he avoid it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, he said, "Ms. Alba..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Osborne could finish, Adriana interrupted him. After glaring at Osborne, she said, "You've already done this to me, so why are you still calling me Ms. Alba? Are you not planning to take responsibility? Or did you just want to play with me once and then pretend nothing ever happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a trace of coldness appeared in Adriana's eyes. "You should know this was my first time. Although I'm much older than you, age no longer matters for people at this cultivation level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are my first man, the first to enter my body. If you want to tell me you just wanted to play with my body, then let's never see each other again. I'll act as if I never knew you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne quickly explained, "What are you thinking? How could I just want to play with your body? How could I not take responsibility for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then just call me Adriana from now on." Adriana rested her face on Osborne's chest, her voice softening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, Adriana." Osborne continued, "Adriana, I was wondering, how should we tell Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita about our relationship? Will you tell them, or should I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana blushed, her expression turning a bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she is Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita's master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is their man, and as their master, she is now leaning in their man's arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made her feel very awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she gritted her teeth and said, "I'll tell them myself. I'll tell them that you, this big scoundrel, seduced me, and I couldn't resist, so I was defiled by you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately became a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana chuckled and said, "Why are you so anxious? I'm joking with you. Don't worry. I know what to say. I promise they won't give you trouble or blame you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll tell them I fell in love with you, so I forced you onto the bed. I'll also tell them I hope they accept me. However, I won't be able to act like their master in front of them anymore; instead, I'll become their close sister."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Adriana's words, Osborne felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't realized before that Adriana was actually someone who loved joking around in private.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since Adriana was willing to tell them herself, Osborne was more than happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This time, it really wasn't my idea. You can't blame me. I've been behaving myself lately. This was completely unexpected. Adriana is stronger than me. I really couldn't resist, though I didn't even try to resist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Adriana, it's just the two of us here now. There's something I must tell you," Osborne changed the subject, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana looked at Osborne in confusion. "What is it? Why are you so serious? Are you going to tell me that besides Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita, you have even more women?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said speechlessly, "What I want to talk about isn't about that, it's about May."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes widened. "May? Don't tell me you got involved with May too? She..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, utterly speechless, gave Adriana a slap on her perky butt. "Stop overthinking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's butt was slapped hard by Osborne. She didn't feel pain; instead, a strange pleasure made her blush with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She asked, "Then why did you bring up May? I thought you had already been involved with her. If that's the case, you really are a big pervert. I can't accept something like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne slapped her perky butt again. "Behave yourself and let me finish talking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I brought up May because I think there's something wrong with her. In the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I saw with my own eyes May entering a strange forest, and then..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression turned extremely serious. "Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "I saw it with my own eyes, and so did Clara, Leroy, and Casey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana frowned, glanced at Osborne, and said, "Speaking of Clara, Leroy, and Casey, tell me now what your relationship with them is. I can see they all have feelings for you. Have you been involved with them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt utterly helpless, thinking, "How did Adriana, who used to seem so strong and serious to me, suddenly turn into a little girl after we got involved? Is this the point? We're clearly talking about May's issue."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne finally explained, "My relationship with them isn't what you think. Clara, Leroy, and Casey are just friends. They might have feelings for me, but that's because of my abilities. I have no such intentions toward them, so they'll just have to be disappointed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Adriana speechlessly and continued, "So, can we get back to the main topic now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana touched her nose and said, "Okay. I'm not jealous, just asking casually. Let's continue discussing May's issue."</span></p><div class="pagination">
