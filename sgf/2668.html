  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Eighth Skyfall Casket, Frederick had mentioned a miraculous continent sealed within the Ninth Skyfall Casket. On that continent grew countless extraordinary plants, and consuming the flowers and fruits they bore could rapidly enhance cultivation level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet also skyrocketed in power because of this!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the situation in the Eighth Skyfall Casket is clearly different from the Ninth Skyfall Casket. What&rsquo;s sealed here is an Ancient Battlefield. Osborne had not seen any living creatures here before, not even a single blade of grass, but now he has discovered a jungle!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Could these be the same extraordinary plants as those in the Ninth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became a bit excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doesn't matter if it is or not, I'll know once I check it out! Anyway, the area is filled with astral projections above Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, which I can't handle right now. Might as well explore the jungle. At least there doesn't seem to be any astral projection battles there, so it should be safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took action immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of thousands of miles were nothing for Osborne. After confirming there was no danger in the jungle, he used interdimensional travel to get there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, the jungle was vast enough, so even if there were some errors while traveling, he wouldn't end up in a dangerous area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne arrived at the edge of the jungle in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he got there, Osborne felt a strong surge of life energy rushing toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This jungle is real after all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is not power projection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy, and what excited him even more was that the crystal-clear fruits on the trees were indeed emperor herb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That really is emperor herb!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had exchanged some emperor herbs at Celestial Spire, including fifty that could extend lifespan, fifty that could enhance potential and talent, and thirty-three that could heal injuries...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each one was incredibly expensive, costing 10 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That&rsquo;s 10 billion battle points, while the exchange price for an Inferior Imperial Artifact is only 5 billion battle points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So the rarity of emperor herb goes without saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One emperor herb or one emperor fruit is worth the equivalent of two Inferior Imperial Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And in this jungle...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just from what Osborne can see now, there are at least hundreds of crystal-clear emperor fruits. And how many more emperor fruits lie deeper in the jungle, Osborne doesn&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye cannot see through the depths of the jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So many!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What exactly are the effects of these emperor fruits?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t sense any danger around, so he reached out and picked an emperor fruit. Smelling its fragrant aroma, he swallowed hard but didn&rsquo;t dare to eat it directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if this emperor fruit was poisonous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to find someone to try it and figure out the effects of this emperor fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his best test subject was, of course, Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne released Hendrix from the Dimensional Microcosm. Hendrix was very weak at this moment. He had still been tormented by Osborne's Spatial Clone these past few days. His eyes were blank, showing no reaction to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, feeling no pity at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He cut a small piece of the emperor fruit, shoved it into Hendrix's mouth, forced him to swallow, and carefully observed the changes in his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Seems like it's not poisonous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hendrix's strength seems to have increased? And the improvement is quite significant. Just one emperor fruit actually boosted his cultivation level this much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept watching Hendrix and only felt completely relieved when he saw there were no adverse reactions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly ate an emperor fruit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt the emperor fruit dissolve within his body, unleashing a massive surge of power that made him feel incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation level also began to rise rapidly. He was already close to reaching Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and now he felt as if his cultivation level was about to break through immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after a while, Osborne's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt his Soul Current Ocean start to tremble. His soul power seemed to boil, even Primordial was alarmed and instantly appeared on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you do?" Primordial asked, looking at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could no longer speak at this moment. He quickly sat cross-legged, trying to suppress the trembling of the Soul Current Ocean. Meanwhile, Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree also worked hard, and finally, not long after, they managed to calm the raging Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you do?" Primordial asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply at this moment. He couldn't understand why Hendrix was fine after eating the emperor fruit, but when he ate it, his Soul Current Ocean would erupt in such turmoil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren&rsquo;t for Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree&rsquo;s help, his Soul Current Ocean would have nearly collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is so strange!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely puzzled and could only tell Primordial everything in detail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial noticed the emperor fruits hanging on the tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rolled his eyes. "Hendrix had no reaction after eating the emperor fruit because you've tormented him so badly lately! His Soul Current Ocean has already shut itself off, so there was no reaction!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This emperor fruit can indeed quickly boost cultivation, but the side effect is that it causes the Soul Current Ocean to tremble. If you're not careful or eat too much, the Soul Current Ocean will definitely collapse, and then you're doomed..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a sudden chill of fear upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It actually has side effects! Then what's the point of it? My Soul Current Ocean is so strong, plus with your help and the Warfare Ancient Tree, I barely avoided collapse... If others eat this emperor fruit, wouldn't they be doomed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head upon hearing that, "Not necessarily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, the side effects of the emperor fruit aren't actually that strong. The stronger the soul power, the greater the side effects! Your Soul Current Ocean is just too powerful, which is why the side effects are so terrifying! For others, there might not be much of a side effect at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it wrong to have a strong Soul Current Ocean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shrugged and said, "There has to be some balance in this world! Anyway, you mustn't try it again! Next time, we might not be able to stabilize your Soul Current Ocean... If you really want to eat it, only take a little at a time, spread it out over many tries!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "That's the only way then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel the immense power of this emperor fruit. If he ate two, he could immediately break through to become an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he could see at least hundreds of emperor fruits on those trees!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he ate them all, not to mention Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he could even easily break through to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He might even break through to Supreme True Imperial Empyrean Sacredness in his cultivation level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, because his Soul Current Ocean was too powerful, the side effects of consuming this emperor fruit were also incredibly terrifying. He could only watch helplessly, not daring to eat more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Forget it, I'll collect them first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, an emperor fruit costs ten billion battle points each in the Celestial Spire! I'll collect them; even if I can't use them myself, I can give them to my parents and grandpa to help them quickly break through their cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began collecting these emperor fruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye and collected all the emperor fruits he could see.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne looked deeper into the jungle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt there must be even better things inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
