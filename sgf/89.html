  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy, in the private room on the second floor, was stunned as he watched the chaotic gunfight erupt downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is the shooter a spy from the Tyger Claws? Damn it, have everyone prepare to fight,&rdquo; Davy roared, thinking it was an attack by their rivals, the Tyger Claws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, the private room door swung open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy looked over and saw a stranger, his face instantly changing. Without a second thought, he pulled out his gun and fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three bullets shot toward the doorway where Osborne stood, less than ten meters away. No ordinary martial artist could dodge them at such close range.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne sidestepped effortlessly, dodging all the bullets with ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His ocular energy flashed, and a chair flew up, smashing into Davy&rsquo;s head. The chair shattered instantly, and Davy was struck on the head, blood pouring down as he collapsed to the ground. He let out a cry of pain, unable to grip the gun anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted coldly and quickly approached Davy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Who&hellip;who are you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy&rsquo;s face twisted with fear as he tried to grab his gun, but Osborne stomped on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy&rsquo;s wrist bones shattered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy screamed in agony, sweating profusely from the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pressed a foot onto Davy&rsquo;s chest and smiled faintly, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to know who I am. Just answer a few questions honestly, and I&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy gritted his teeth and snorted coldly, &ldquo;You want me to answer your questions? You&rsquo;re dreaming. I&rsquo;ve had professional training; even if you kill me, I won&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered. He believed Davy but didn&rsquo;t plan on torturing him for answers today. He had another method prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pulled out a vial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Truth serum.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had spent a fortune to buy this from the Draco Star Wristlet&rsquo;s marketplace. It came from the Godfather&rsquo;s medical research lab and could make anyone who ingested it fall into a confused state, answering any question truthfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took out a pill, grabbed Davy&rsquo;s jaw, and forced it into his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What did you give me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy looked panicked, but with Osborne&rsquo;s foot pressing on his chest, he felt as if a mountain were crushing him, unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne waited patiently, unsure if the truth serum was as miraculous as advertised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Five seconds later, Davy&rsquo;s eyes suddenly became vacant, as if he had fallen into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is it working?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t sure, so he asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? What&rsquo;s your position?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy&rsquo;s face was blank, and he responded reflexively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;My name is Davy. I am the leader of Maelstrom and the liaison for the Aberrants in Mayby City.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The truth serum really worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly glanced downstairs, seeing the chaos gradually subsiding. Knowing time was short, he accelerated his questioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Tell me, who is the mole for the Aberrants in the Radcliffe family?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Paul.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Paul is a trusted member of the Radcliffe family, groomed from a young age. Why did he betray the Radcliffe family to help the Aberrants?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Because the Aberrants promised to make him a powerful metahuman and give him thirty percent of the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s wealth once the plan succeeded.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Were the three attacks on Clarissa carried out by the Aberrants? Was Paul involved?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes. All three attacks were orchestrated by us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The first attack had nothing to do with Paul. It failed because of the valiant protection by Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards. That&rsquo;s when we decided to bribe Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The second attack was an inside job with Paul&rsquo;s help, but we underestimated Donna&rsquo;s strength, resulting in failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;For the third attack, the organization sent Raymond, a Class C+ metahuman with lightning abilities, to keep Donna occupied while others teamed up with Paul to kill Clarissa.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But Osborne appeared, saved Clarissa, and thwarted our plan.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Davy finished, a cold glint flashed in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He continued, &ldquo;Tell me about your plan for tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the specific details.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned. &ldquo;What about the exact time and place?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know Paul will find a way to poison Donna, rendering her powerless. Once he sends the signal, we&rsquo;ll act.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought for a moment and asked, &ldquo;Are the Aberrants plotting against all the major families?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How exactly?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We support the direct descendants who join us, helping them become the heirs of major families, thus controlling the families and turning them into subordinate forces of the organization.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How many major families in Mayby City are under your control?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;About half.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What exactly are you plotting?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The entire underground world of Rosmandi.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s final question was, &ldquo;Why do you have to kill Clarissa?&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
