  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hammer of Thor was something Osborne absolutely needed to obtain. Even if the opponent was the Supernal Deity King, he had to give it a shot. After all, the Hammer of Thor was an Ultimate divine artifact, and if paired with the Thundergod Gloves, it would become one of the most powerful Ultimate divine artifacts in existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Anastasia's hands&mdash;blessed with top-tier Thunder Power&mdash;its power would surpass any Ultimate divine artifact. No amount of Celestial Crystals could buy something of that magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't want to worry Zachary and the others. These newly reunited uncles and aunts genuinely cared for and worried about him. So, if Osborne insisted on heading to Astral Wolf Peak, trading Kurt and Trevor in the process, he knew they would be utterly terrified and might even insist on going with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to drag them into his mess. After thinking for a moment, he said with a calm tone, "Thanks for your advice, Uncle Zachary. I know what to do now. I'll listen to you and won't go to Astral Wolf Peak. I'll stay here in Hudson Valley, focus on my training, and not go anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face lit up with relief, and his tense expression softened considerably. "That's great. Don't worry. I'll handle Kurt's situation. As long as you don't head to Astral Wolf Peak, I'll make sure Trevor doesn't track you down. Even if he does, as long as you stay in Hudson Valley, he won't be able to do anything to you. The Hudson family will protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "That puts my mind at ease. Uncle Zachary, I won't bother you anymore. I'm heading back to train."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well then," Zachary said, waving his hand with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne returned to the villa, Zachary immediately called for a young man&mdash;his son, Virgil, and the future heir of the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary instructed seriously, "Virgil, keep an eye on Osborne for me. Don't let him leave Hudson Valley, no matter what. If he makes any sudden moves, let me know right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil's expression was a mix of exasperation and disbelief. "Father, didn't he just promise not to go to Astral Wolf Peak? Do you really think he'll break his word? I don't think he's that reckless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary shot him a stern look. "What do you know? Osborne isn't like ordinary people. He's braver than most, and while he agreed just now, who knows if he'll sneak out later? Just like your aunt Vivienne back then&mdash;she swore she wouldn't leave with Theodore, but what happened? She snuck off anyway, and we couldn't stop her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh, Zachary added, "Osborne is just like her. Once he sets his sights on something, he doesn't care about anything else. He's fearless and, worst, stubborn as a mule. No one can change his mind. So, you must watch him closely and make sure he doesn't leave Hudson Valley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil nodded. "Got it. Don't worry. With me keeping an eye on him, there's no way he's leaving Hudson Valley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary nodded with a smile. He was quite satisfied with Virgil and had a lot of confidence in him. After all, Virgil was the Hudson family's top genius. Not long ago, he had broken through to the advanced Deity King Level. In terms of strength, he wasn't far behind Zachary himself. So, with Virgil keeping an eye on Osborne, Zachary felt there wouldn't be any problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil, ever obedient, stationed himself not far from Osborne's villa. He kept a close watch, monitoring Osborne's presence to ensure he hadn't left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the villa, Osborne noticed Virgil tailing him and couldn't help but feel a little exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "Uncle Zachary really sent someone to spy on me. He still doesn't trust me, huh? But this time, he's guessed right. When I've made up my mind about something, nothing can convince me otherwise. The Hammer of Thor? It's mine. Astral Wolf Peak? I'm heading there, too." With that, he got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary thought that having Virgil keep an eye on Osborne would be enough to stop him from leaving Hudson Valley. That, however, underestimated Osborne&mdash;and showed he didn't really understand him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne quickly conjured a Spatial Clone. Then, he stripped off his clothes and had the clone wear them. Under his control, the clone walked out of the villa and wandered casually around Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone the clone passed greeted it as if nothing was unusual. Naturally, Virgil's attention was drawn to it as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the real Osborne had disguised himself as Tristan. Without a hint of hesitation, he strolled boldly out of Hudson Valley's gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, it would have been faster and easier to leave Hudson Valley using interdimensional travel, but the entire area was shrouded in a massive divine power barrier. Rumor had it that the barrier was highly advanced and was capable of detecting any spatial fluctuations. If Osborne had used interdimensional travel, he likely would've been caught. So, he opted for the simplest, least flashy approach&mdash;disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne was safely outside Hudson Valley's boundaries, he reverted to his usual "Theodore" appearance. Then, he used interdimensional travel to swiftly make his way to Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astral Wolf Peak was a towering, solitary spire just outside Apocalypse City. It rose like a spear, piercing straight into the heavens. Not far from the peak, countless figures were already hovering in midair, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people had come rushing over after hearing the news, eager to watch the commotion. Among them, Osborne even spotted two familiar faces&mdash;his eldest and second aunts, Alicia and Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't approach them, choosing instead to wait quietly. There were still 30 minutes until the time he had agreed upon for the transaction.</span></p><div class="pagination">
