More than half of the Godsons in </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> were from the Rosenthal family's younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of strength, the Rosenthal family was superior to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why they dared to issue a challenge in Newport City, the Augustine family's own territory in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within the League of Divine Descent, there were twenty-eight families just as powerful as the Rosenthal family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To offend the League of Divine Descent meant that the Augustine family had little chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were deeply anxious. Even Vincent and Matthew showed signs of fear. All their eyes were fixed on Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a matter of life and death for the Augustine family, and only Godfather could make the decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sneered as he looked at Godfather and coldly asked, "Sebastian, how do you plan to handle this? He dared to possess light elemental power, blaspheming the gods. I suggest you hand him over to me so I can take him to the Mount of Gods for execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should personally apologize to all the members of the League of Divine Descent. Perhaps then, the League might show mercy to the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Everett finished, the members of the Augustine family breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just glad there was still a way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Everett's demand that Godfather hand over Osborne didn't seem like much. After all, if sacrificing Osborne meant saving the Augustine family, it was a small price to pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked to the Godfather, waiting for his response. They were certain he would agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not immediately answer Everett but instead looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also looking at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, waiting for Godfather's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Will Godfather hand me over to Everett?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will he let Everett take me to the Mount of Gods for execution?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just kept his eyes fixed on Godfather. No one else knew that Godfather was his biological grandfather, but even that might not be enough to save him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, protecting him would mean going to war with the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if war broke out, the Augustine family was almost certain to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea what choice Godfather would make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was deeply curious. At this moment, he felt no fear or dread, just a burning desire to see how his grandfather would act under these circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued to meet Osborne's gaze, his eyes betraying no emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he looked away and turned his attention to Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke, "Everett, what if I don't hand him over to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, a wave of shock rippled through the members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected Godfather to protect Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had guessed that he would choose to go to war with the Divine Families for Osborne's sake. They hadn't expected Godfather to risk the destruction of the entire Augustine family rather than give Osborne up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many members of the Augustine family felt a surge of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's authority still held, so they didn't dare speak up. However, their eyes were filled with rage as they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, too, was surprised. He said coldly, "Sebastian, do you know what you're doing? You're really not going to hand him over to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want the Augustine family to be exterminated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you ask for die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's tone was harsh and menacing, but Godfather remained calm and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly and replied, "I don't want to see the Augustine family destroyed, and I certainly don't want to die, but I also have no intention of handing him over to you for execution. You have no right to execute him for this, nor do you have the right to claim he's blasphemed the gods just because he possesses light elemental power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett frowned deeply. "You personally signed the Divine Accord all those years ago! Now, he has acquired light elemental power. No matter the reason, he's committed blasphemy and must face the consequences!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you say I don't have the right to execute him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett seemed even more furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you must be mad! If you don't hand him over, then prepare coffins for all the members of the Augustine family, for the League of Divine Descent will surely declare war on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's gaze was filled with threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were in a state of panic. One of them spoke up, "Godfather, you mustn't be impulsive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't make all of us pay for Osborne's mistake! Just handing him over will protect the Augustine family. I implore you to give up Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, I also ask that you give up Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne should bear the consequences of his own mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, you need to stay calm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more high-ranking members of the Augustine family began to urge Godfather to reconsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face was filled with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Godfather's expression turned severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's shout made everyone cover their ears in fear, silencing them instantly. However, their expressions remained resolute. They still hoped Godfather would hand Osborne over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather paid them no mind and kept his gaze on Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, you keep saying he's blasphemed the gods. Why don't you ask him how he came by his light elemental power before making any decisions?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
