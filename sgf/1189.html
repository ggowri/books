  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's declaration hung heavy in the air, leaving Cain momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So wait, you're not after the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energy to destroy it&mdash;you're actually planning to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A booming laughter erupted from Cain as he stood atop the petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, clutching his sides in hysterics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, I have to hand it to you&mdash;you're sharp! I'll admit, I never thought of teaming up with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The whole point of me talking to you was to convince you to get me out of this hellhole!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I'm free, I can regain my former self and quickly rebuild my power. And then, I'd find you again, take you down, and reclaim the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;because it belongs to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I didn't see coming was that the Lotus would actually damage its own essence and gift you so much core energy! My only concern was it giving you too much and risking its own destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the fact that you want to kill me? Now that's a plot twist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his face twisted with disdain, Cain continued, "You think you can take me on? You're just a Junior Deity! Back in my prime, I could have blown you away with a single breath! Even now, with just a fragment of my soul remaining and my powers stripped away, you wouldn't stand a chance against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even the most powerful Deity King, God of Night, could take me down. And you? You're nobody!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can end me? Ha! That's rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain laughed wildly, his arrogance spilling over as he showed no fear in facing Osborne. The moment Osborne had declared his intention to attack, Cain dropped any pretense of collaboration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was convinced that Osborne posed no real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Honestly, with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity shielding me, there's no way this guy can hurt me, no matter how much stronger he thinks he is. Even if he completes the fifth fusion step with the Lotus, he still won't achieve true immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, I might not have my freedom, but I'm virtually indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who among us could kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Lotus' protection, I could last through the end of the universe and still remain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly, but he wasn't overly concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so, God of Sin Cain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a bit too cocky! Just because you have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity on your side doesn't mean I can't deal with you. You're right; I'm just a Junior Deity compared to what you once were, but today is different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Junior Deity is going to take you down! Oh, and by the way, I should mention that those nine shards of core energy I pulled from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? They weren't freely given to me&mdash;I actively extracted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I have an easier time controlling the Lotus than you do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne unleashed the full force of the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its petals began to tremble ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The protective energy that surrounded Cain, provided by the Lotus, had shielded him from any attack&mdash;even from the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as Osborne fervently channeled the Breath of Celestial, that very energy began to retreat, drawn away from Cain and into Osborne's domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden turn of events left Cain utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? That core energy of the nine Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity wasn't a gift to you? You took it by force? No way! That's absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've gone through five steps of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus, and even then, I couldn't control it, let alone siphon off any of its energy! How on earth did you manage to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just not possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's frantic shouts echoed with a mix of anger and deep-seated fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could already feel the protective power he had relied on fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was truly controlling the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his control was weak, it was strong enough to pull the protective energy right out from under Cain's feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the backing of the Lotus, Cain was nothing more than a fractured soul. Even at his pinnacle as a Deity Overlord, he was now reduced to a vulnerable shadow of his former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! No way!" Cain protested, still stuck in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all too late&mdash;his protective energy had vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark ignited in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cain, your time is up! You wanted to take me down? Well, I guess I'll be doing the </span><span>honors first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Cain's fragile soul was flung far away from the shelter of the Primordial Crimson Lotus, away from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic and rage filled Cain's eyes as he found himself reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost the protection of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain bellowed, his voice dripping with venom, "You're dead meat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a mere Junior Deity can kill me? Kid, you're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was once a Deity Overlord, and my skills are beyond anything you can conceive! Sure, I'm just a ghost of my former self now, but if I fight tooth and nail, I could take out any Intermediate Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you'd better be ready to meet your maker!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
