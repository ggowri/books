Although the guests left the estate, they didn't go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could sense that a fierce battle was raging within the Paltrow Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying thunderbolts struck incessantly, and intense energy fluctuations clashed wildly. Even a fool could tell that something significant was happening to the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, they all stayed outside the estate, looking for high ground to observe the battle inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, they witnessed a terrifying war with their own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne single-handedly slaughtered all the Class B and above powerhouses of the Paltrow family. Even Robert, Alexander, and Wade were killed by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Brian, Nathan, and Queenie were both shocked and delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could feel that everyone around them was looking at them with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the heir of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's display of power in killing Alexander and Wade frightened these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, because they were too far away, they could only see the battle but couldn't hear what was said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the battle ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone emerged from the Paltrow Estate. It was five young men and women, each looking incredibly disheveled. One of them had even fainted, her pretty face red and swollen with slap marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five were Evelynn, Charlie, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were highly unsightly, their eyes filled with anger and hatred towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, their faces had been wholly ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne not only injured them but also severely humiliated them. They didn't even dare to utter any harsh words and fled in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their anger intensified when they saw so many people outside the manor witnessing their disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? Get lost!" Charlie cursed, visibly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the guests weren't intimidated. One of them asked, "What exactly happened? Why would Osborne, the heir of the Augustine family, slaughter the Paltrow family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Charlie's expression darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who am I supposed to ask? Osborne's a madman! He insisted on butchering the Paltrow family, but we couldn't stop him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie snapped back coldly, then sneered in anger, "Tell Osborne something for me! Tell him we won't forget what happened today! It isn't over; we won't let him off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Powell family and the Hayes family of Newport City won't let him off either! He's a dead man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell him to get ready to meet his maker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these harsh words, Charlie felt slightly better, glanced at the manor, and seeing no sign of Osborne chasing after them, he breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie and his companions quickly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his severe words left all the guests shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Powell family and the Hayes family of Newport </span><span>City !</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five young men and women were all from ancient families of Newport City, so it was no wonder they sat in the VIP seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne had actually hurt them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone turned their gaze in one direction, their eyes filled with pity and a hint of schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Brian, Nathan, and Queenie, among others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is doomed! Their heir, Osborne, is indeed powerful; he even defeated Alexander. But foolishly, he has offended the ancient families of Newport City. The Augustine family is finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, the Powell family and the Hayes family will annihilate the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone mockingly looked at Brian and his group, especially the members from the ancient families of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, who breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had terrified them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could destroy the Paltrow family and just as easily wipe them out. They were so afraid that they had considered appeasing the Augustine family to avoid Osborne's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they felt there was no need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had offended the ancient families of Newport City, the Powell and Hayes families. Osborne was as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Brian and his group were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could sense the mocking tones around them, and their expressions grew grim and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were the ancient families of Newport City, the Powell family, and the Hayes family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These families had roots in Newport City for centuries, each incredibly powerful, far beyond the Paltrow family's reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Osborne had offended them, nobody knew what would become of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, panic set in among Brian and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne and Clarissa finally emerged, hand in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, still in her pristine white wedding dress, blissfully held Osborne's hand and leaned on him as if no one else existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was picturesque and filled with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the looks on everyone's faces as they watched them were mixed with pity and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you wreaked havoc on the Paltrow Estate for this woman, right? To offend one of Newport City's ancient families over a woman is practically suicide!" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard it but didn't care. His gaze swept over the crowd until it landed on Brian and Nathan. Smiling, he nodded at them and walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian and Nathan hurried to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?" Brian asked, full of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I'm fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Paltrow family, all their Class B and above fighters are dead. The Paltrow family is finished. Brian, you need to take over their assets immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to obstruct or compete, just kill them!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
