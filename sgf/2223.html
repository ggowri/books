  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's face was ashen, the seal on his powers combined with his severe injuries rendering him no different from an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that any further struggle would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Bancroft began to speak, "Before I say anything else, let me warn you that the backer I'm connected to is not someone you want to mess with. </span><span>There are very few people in the entire Racial Convergence Stellar Region who would dare to cross him! You think nobody notices our slave trading? Think again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plenty of people are aware of the irregularities, but none have the guts to investigate. That's because my backer wields immense power..." A flash of pride glimmered in Bancroft's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, interrupting, "Enough with the games! Just tell me who he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft hesitated for a moment, then replied, "His name is Scottie Lillard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guy I deal with directly is always called Scottie. Whenever he needs slaves, he contacts me directly and tells me to prepare them. Once I'm ready, I notify him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Bancroft had finished speaking, he fixed his gaze on Osborne's face, his expression earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. "Scottie? What faction does he belong to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a derisive laugh, Bancroft answered, "Phantom Commerce Guild!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Commerce Guild?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression paled dramatically, realization dawning upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it&mdash;the one orchestrating slave trading for the Phantom Tide Demon Sect was associated with the Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could spell real trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft sneered and said, "I see you know of the Phantom Commerce Guild!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that makes this easier. Now that you're aware of the backing I have, just let me go and return my slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your little incident with my son, let's pretend that never happened. But those slaves are mine, or else you're going to have a world of trouble when the Phantom Commerce Guild comes after you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Messing with the Phantom Commerce Guild's assets won't end well for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown grew even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, standing close by, looked worried. "Osborne, what's going on? Just how powerful is this Phantom Commerce Guild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, then finally nodded. "It's not just strong; it's incredibly powerful! You could say it's at the very top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Phantom Commerce Guild is one of the most top-notch forces on the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Racial Convergence Planet is huge&mdash;way bigger than Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to it, Celestara is just a tiny little world. The Racial Convergence Planet is the only really important large-scale life planet in this area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the Racial Convergence Planet, there are countless powerful factions, each one a force to be reckoned with, holding a candle to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. In fact, the Phantom Tide Demon Sect would be considered a Piddling Power on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are three top-tier </span><span>Powers</span><span> on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are the </span><span>Evernight Court</span><span>, the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and the Phantom Commerce Guild."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened a bit when he mentioned the Glorious Divine Kingdom. After all, it was his homeland, and he was the son of the kingdom's ruler; he'd once been a prince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly pulled himself together and carried on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although there are countless factions on the Racial Convergence Planet, these three are the most powerful. Together, they control more than half of the planet's territory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Evernight Court has the largest expanse of land and the most power. Next comes the Glorious Divine Kingdom, which also ranks second in terms of territory. The Phantom Commerce Guild may have a smaller territory, but its influence and strength are comparable to those of both the Evernight Court and the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their business isn't confined to the Racial Convergence Stellar Region; it reaches out to neighboring star-systems. </span><span>The wealth and resources they have far exceed those of either the Evernight Court or the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Evernight Court and the Glorious Divine Kingdom are careful not to provoke the Phantom Commerce Guild. They even actively invite the Guild to do business in their territories..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, feeling the full weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just shocking that the Phantom Commerce Guild, which has a good reputation, is secretly involved in the slave trade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face became solemn. "So, is the Phantom Commerce Guild really that powerful? Does that mean we have to call off our investigation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bancroft was speaking the truth, they were truly stuck in a dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phantom Commerce Guild would never admit to their part in the slave-trading business, nor would they sell out their clients by disclosing the location of the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration welled up in Osborne, and he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd finally got a clue about his parents, only to hit a brick wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ground his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Phantom Commerce Guild... Scottie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I don't care! This is the only lead I've got to find my parents, and I'm not backing down! The Phantom Commerce Guild may be super powerful, but that Scottie is not necessarily unbeatable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't have to go head-to-head with the Phantom Commerce Guild! If I can track down Scottie and capture him, I might be able to squeeze out information that will lead me to the Frenetic Storm Warband and my parents!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely determination in his eyes, Osborne shifted his gaze back to Bancroft. "What's Scottie's standing in the Phantom Commerce Guild?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft kept his cool. "So, you're thinking of skipping the Phantom Commerce Guild and going straight for Scottie? I'd strongly advise against it! Not only is Scottie an Empyrean Sacredness warrior who could crush you with ease, but his status is way out of your league!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the son of Russell Lillard, one of the three vice-presidents who heads the Guild! He's one of the most high-profile figures on Racial Convergence Planet! Wherever he goes, he's always surrounded by the top-notch guards of the Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to take him on? That's just asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew even gloomier, but he couldn't help sneering at Bancroft's self-satisfied look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the son of a vice-president? What's so great about that? I'm a rightful prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! I'll get my hands on him one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft let out a scornful scoff. "A prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Do you think I'm stupid? There are seventeen princes in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and I've never even heard of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just sneered, not bothering to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true; he was the fifteenth prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. But he'd been banished over a thousand years ago and stripped of his title by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all in the distant past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, before heading to Racial Convergence Planet, Osborne had two goals in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only wanted to find his parents in this lifetime but also intended to visit the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, Osborne planned to pay his respects to his mother from his past life and, more importantly, avenge her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of murderous intent flashed across Osborne's eyes. The memory of his mother's unjust and tragic end was like a shadow that followed him. Every time Osborne remembered how helplessly he'd watched her suffer, his heart was filled with anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone who has wronged my mother in my past life will have to face the consequences!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to calm the seething rage inside him and then turned his attention back to Bancroft. "You said earlier that you weren't lying. I need to check if that's true..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft frowned, not liking the sound of that. "Check? How do you propose to do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a cold smile. "Easy. I'll kill you and then rummage through your memories!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
