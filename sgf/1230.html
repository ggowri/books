  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a parallel dimension, Osborne stood quietly, taking in everything Joseph and the others were saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief escaped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "It seems Mila hasn't </span><span>fooled</span><span> me. She's not just some super-genius of the Deschanel family; she was truly kidnapped by Terrence and brought into their ranks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can trust Mila."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That innocent look in her eyes&mdash;it's impossible to fake. They're so pure that I find it hard to believe anyone with a dark heart could possess such sincerity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I gather her, she's coming back with me to the Augustine Estate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though she's currently only at the Intermediate Deity level, she has once reached the level of a Celestial Deity. Regaining her strength shouldn't take long! And let's not forget, she holds a Level Six Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, she has a grudge against the Deschanel family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk played on Osborne's face as he contemplated his next moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's booming voice broke through the tension. "Speak! Tell me what's going on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions on the faces of several Deschanel family members were a mix of terror and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they were in deep trouble. Thirty-seven Sanctuary Caskets had gone missing on their watch, and they could feel the weight of Joseph's and the ancestral deities' fury looming over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with menace, as if Joseph were ready to kill them, and yet they had no clue what had actually happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they had been caught off guard by Osborne's Psychic Blast, knocking them into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion swirled in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, one brave soul stepped forward, his face a mask of uncertainty. "Mr. Damian Deschanel! Ancestors! I think I might know what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward him, including Osborne's, a grin forming at the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plan was about to bear fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak!" Joseph commanded coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man took a deep breath; his words rushed out. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we were stationed here, not long after you all left, the door to the sanctuary was suddenly kicked open. We were furious&mdash;this is the sacred ground of the Deschanel family! How dare anyone just barge in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We shouted at them, but before we could fully assess the situation, we were hit with a powerful mental assault. It knocked us out cold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After what felt like an eternity, I began to come to, but I was still in this half-awake, half-dreaming state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was then I heard the thief talking while taking the Sanctuary Caskets! I learned his identity and understood his intentions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eyes lit up with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what identity does this thief hold? What's his plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man couldn't afford to hesitate. He hurriedly recounted everything he had heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he revealed, the more the expressions on the faces of the Deschanel family members darkened with a mix of shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the League of Divine Descent?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're the ones who snatched our Sanctuary Caskets? And now they want to deliver them to their gods? Not to mention, their gods will be awakening soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they trying to stir up trouble for us and prevent us from awakening more deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation hung heavily over Joseph and the others; their faces had turned taut with seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you absolutely sure you didn't mishear anything?" Joseph's piercing gaze bore into the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat beaded on the man's forehead, fear evident in his eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joseph Deschanel, I swear I didn't hear wrong. I was fully conscious of every word! That thief didn't expect my mental strength to be so robust, which is why I woke up earlier than the others. I was still in that hazy state, but I captured every single word he said. I wouldn't mix that up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, a heavy silence fell over the room, everyone absorbing the shocking news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Damian said, "Mr. Joseph Deschanel, there's no way he would lie about something like this! I believe him; the League of Divine Descent is the most formidable force in our world today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've always proclaimed themselves the descendants of the gods, even forbidding others from wielding light elemental power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now, our guys traced the fleeing thief and found he was headed toward Marcelin. Along the way, there were faint traces of light elemental energy left behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we can pretty much confirm it was the League of Divine Descent behind this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've had ambitions of ruling the world for ages!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that they've stumbled upon our secret, they're bound to see us as their biggest threat. They'll most likely ramp up the awakening of their gods to come after us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to prepare, and we need to do it fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph snorted at the mention of the League. "Damn those League of Divine Descent bastards! They think they can make a move against the Deschanel family? They're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd planned to take control of Rosmandi first, then deal with them, but it looks like I need to rethink that strategy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within Rosmandi, there aren't any particularly strong factions; even the Augustine family in Newport City is nothing to us. We could wipe them out anytime we want! But that League? They've got gods on the verge of waking up, and those will be our fiercest rivals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's cut to the chase&mdash;we need to take out the League of Divine Descent first!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The icy glare in Joseph's eyes spoke volumes, revealing a simmering rage wrapped in cold determination.</span></p><div class="pagination">
