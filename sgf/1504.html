  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man, upon hearing Osborne's question, puffed up with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't recognize me? No surprise, coming from the lowly Human Community! Listen closely. I hail from the Keynes family of the Crimson Ironhoof Clan. My name is Kerwin Keynes. Within the Wild Flame Army, I hold the esteemed position of chiliarch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even your uncle Calvin greets me with the utmost respect. So, let me be clear. I've had my eye on that manor for a long time, and now that it's for sale, I intend to claim it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will relinquish your claim immediately and step aside. Otherwise, I won't be lenient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think for a moment that surviving twenty minutes against Fabian makes you a big shot. To us in the major powers, you're still just a lowly human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, the Crimson Ironhoof Clan excels in speed. Toying with a Deity Overlord like Fabian is nothing special; I can do it better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we clash, your speed won't save you. You won't stand a chance in any aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just back down gracefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kerwin looked at Osborne with an air of haughty triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited anger in Betty and her two sisters, who glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin, however, remained unruffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze even lingered on the three women with a predatory interest. "So, these are the three Celestial Deity human slaves you bought at the auction for 50 million Essence Crystals, huh? No wonder you crossed paths with Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are indeed exquisite. Perhaps you should also transfer them to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrogance grew even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up to face Kerwin, his voice calm but cutting. "I thought Fabian was already stupid enough, but it seems there's someone even dumber. Who do you think you are, speaking to me like this? Not only do you demand I give up the manor, but you also want these women? What gives you the right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it your long face, your stupidity, or your shamelessness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's fury ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insolent wretch! You're begging for a beating! Your speed might be impressive, but against me, it's nothing. I'll make you regret every word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then step outside and let's see you make good on that threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Osborne strode towards the exit of the Urban Development Exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting outside. Have the guts to follow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's face contorted in a mixture of anger and uncertainty. "You damned lowborn human, daring to disrespect and insult me? You're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stormed out after Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young warriors behind him, visibly excited, egged him on. "Uncle Kerwin, teach him a harsh lesson! He's gotten too big for his britches, thinking that playing with Fabian's speed makes him some big shot. Make him understand that he's still just a lowly human!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin sneered, his confidence restored. "Rest assured. I'll show him just how insignificant he really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the air grew tense as Osborne faced Kerwin, his expression calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His recent battle with Fabian Deity Overlord had catapulted him to fame in Wild Flame City, but many remained unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's speed was impressive, but he hadn't engaged Fabian in direct combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most, he was merely fast; limit his speed or match it, and he'd crumble easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin believed this, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's decision to confront Kerwin wasn't just fueled by anger over the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sought to showcase more of his abilities to prove he was more than just speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To provoke him, one must carefully consider the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin declared haughtily, "You still have a chance to beg for mercy. Surrender the manor and hand over those exquisite human slaves. Otherwise, you'll soon regret crossing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "You talk too much. Guess I'll have to knock out those teeth of yours so you can't spew any more nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shrouded in faint lightning, he shot toward Kerwin with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne was face-to-face with Kerwin, divine power encasing his fist as he delivered a powerful blow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
