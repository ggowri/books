  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a lead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he pointed at one of the trembling figures. "You! Speak! Tell me everything you know about what happened back then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y... yes," the man stammered, fear evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and began recounting the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the day, the Hastings family was still part of the royal lineage of </span><span>Felona</span><span>, residing in the bustling outskirts of </span><span>Beliken</span><span> City. After Reginald abducted Osborne's parents, he locked them away in the Hastings family dungeon, subjecting them to daily beatings and torment, all in a desperate attempt to force their compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one day, against all odds, Osborne's parents managed to regain their powers and escape from the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, the Hastings family sent a group after them&mdash;this very group standing before Osborne now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the trail left by the fleeing couple, they ventured deep into a jungle in </span><span>Felona</span><span>, eventually spotting them hiding in a vast natural gorge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to capture the couple, an enormous and bizarre black vortex appeared out of nowhere, pulling Osborne's parents in with a fierce, irresistible force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't resist; they let the vortex consume them, vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hastings family members, paralyzed by fear, hesitated to pursue them into the unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the vortex disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sent others to search the gorge afterward, but the black vortex was never seen again, and the incident faded from their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the man finished his tale, he nervously glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear it's all true! I never meant to torment your parents; I was just following Reginald's orders. Please, have mercy! I realize my mistakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression </span><span>hardened,</span><span> his gaze icy as he fixed it on the pleading man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just following orders? You think that's enough to save you? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne decided he wouldn't waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you who tormented my parents, go down to hell and repent! As for whether you're lying, I have my ways of finding out. But since you've chosen to confess, I'll make your suffering a little lighter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, the man's body exploded in a shower of blood, leaving nothing but a gruesome mist behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over the remaining members of the Hastings family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, paid them no mind. Activating Satan's Eye, he instantly captured the man's memories, constructing a mental palace to sift through the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he found himself immersed in the vivid scenes of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man hadn't lied!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's parents had indeed been cornered in that gorge, and just as they were about to be captured, the black vortex had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The size of that vortex astonished Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had previously speculated that his parents might have slipped into some Dimensional Microcosm, as those realms also had black vortexes as entry points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing the enormity of this particular vortex, he realized it couldn't possibly lead to a Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was far too vast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a new hypothesis struck Osborne like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the enormous black vortex that suddenly appeared is the dimensional portal between Blue Planet and </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? The very gateway connecting to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, then my parents might have... entered </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a rush of excitement through Osborne. If, twenty-five years ago, they truly made it into </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, there was still a chance they were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, they could have perished long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara</span><span> today was likely far more perilous than Blue Planet ever was. Twenty-five years ago, his parents were merely Class AA and Class AAA warriors. In a place like </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, they might have struggled to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they were captured by the Dark Deity Legion the moment they arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe the harsh environment of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was too much for them to handle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, even if he confirmed that this dimensional portal led to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, he still couldn't know for sure whether his parents were alive or dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at least there was hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne closed his eyes and let out a long, deep breath. He felt an overwhelming urge to rush to the great gorge in </span><span>Felona</span><span> to stand at the very spot where that black vortex had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial power, he knew that if he could just get there and see the vortex, he wouldn't even need to step through it to determine if it was indeed a gateway to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could do that, Osborne had to take care of the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't allow them to continue existing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, wiping out over three thousand </span><span>god</span><span>-level warriors and hundreds of thousands of ordinary metahumans would be a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had long since devised a plan for dealing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would transform them all into the Blood Clan!</span></p><div class="pagination">
