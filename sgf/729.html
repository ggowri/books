  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Vincent really just lose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was in shock, their faces a mix of disbelief and amazement. No one had expected Vincent to be defeated, let alone so quickly and without putting up a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, he hadn't fully recovered from his injuries, but Emma's swift victory left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't even needed to use her signature move, Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all eyes were on Emma, their expressions glowing with admiration as if witnessing the rise of an unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated Vincent's utter failure, falling to Emma in just a few moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is Emma really that strong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It doesn't seem likely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have always found her Freeze power ineffective against me; my martial art aura can easily counter it. Her Psychic Blast has no impact either, and while Death's Stare is a bit tricky, I have my own Light of Redemption to neutralize it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Osborne hadn't considered Emma a serious threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But watching Vincent, another Class AAA, get taken down so effortlessly by her made him question everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Is Vincent just weak, or is Emma genuinely powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps... am I simply too powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd gawked in astonishment, Emma maintained her composure. She turned to the visibly frustrated Vincent and said with a faint smile, "You couldn't even beat me, the second-ranked one. Don't even think about challenging Osborne; you'd just embarrass yourself. It's time to pass on that 'strongest of the younger generation' title you've been holding onto."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent clenched his fists, unable to muster a comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been thoroughly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking through to Class AAA, Emma's Freeze power was overwhelming. Even with all his might, it would take him time to recover, and just when he thought he could push through, she'd freeze him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Psychic Blast still left his head pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit it!" Vincent ground out, his teeth gritted. "The title of strongest among the younger generation is yours. But I refuse to accept that I'm weaker than Osborne! Just because I lost to you doesn't mean I'll lose to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma raised an eyebrow, her expression dripping with disdain. Osborne was far stronger than she was, and she was about to say so when she noticed him shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suit yourself. One day, you'll see the truth," Emma said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned her attention to Owen. "What about you, Owen? Are you feeling cocky too? If you think you can take me, step up! If you beat me, then you can challenge Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew better than to underestimate Emma. If Vincent couldn't handle her, he'd likely be taken down in one hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen scoffed, crossing his arms. "I'll admit I'm not your match. But I'll say this: your strength doesn't mean Osborne's strong too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't bow to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just hiding behind women! His first-place finish? All thanks to his girlfriend! And now he's hiding behind you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a chord, and many in the Augustine family nodded in agreement, glancing at Osborne with a mixture of skepticism and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Looks like everyone thinks I'm just riding on a woman's coattails to claim first place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, let's settle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped into the center of the training ground, locking eyes with Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's have a go. I'll give you what you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Owen smirked. "So, Osborne, you finally found the guts to step up! Good! I'll take you down right here and now, and everyone will see that you're not fit to be the Augustine family's first heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flash, Owen appeared right in front of Osborne, his eyes brimming with confidence and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him calmly and extended a single finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was taken aback and sneered, saying, "What's this supposed to mean? You want me to give you a free hit? Ha, I can give you three if you need it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No, what I mean is, one move is all it will take to deal with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's anger flared up immediately. "Arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Owen made his move. With a swift motion, dark clouds gathered, and lightning crackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several terrifying balls of electricity formed in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Explosion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen roared, launching the orbs of lightning toward Osborne. This was an Intermediate Level application of lightning elemental power, and Owen had mastered it to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, feel my wrath! You think you can beat me in one move? I'll blast you to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The balls of lightning exploded around Osborne, and the sheer force made the spectators step back in shock, their faces full of awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seemed to forget about dodging as he was engulfed by the intense storm of thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ferocious Thunder Explosion overwhelmed him instantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
