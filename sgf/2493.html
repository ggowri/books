  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne was a bit surprised. He hadn't expected the power of this arrow to be so strong, instantly killing the pirate leader outright, with its force even overflowing and completely crushing his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this was his first time facing a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, he had fought an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior. That time, even when he used his strongest Heaven Arrow, it was completely useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That warrior waved his hand, and his Heaven Arrow shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne originally thought that even if a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior couldn't block his Earth Arrow, they would at least put up some resistance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the pirate leader was instantly killed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "So, I've become this strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, he hadn't even used his full strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he used the Earth Arrow, he only shot one arrow, which was the weakest attack. He could still shoot three arrows at once, ten arrows at once, or even thousands of arrows at once!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, he could still instantly kill a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe it was because he was too careless and didn't defend seriously?" Osborne murmured. Then, he quickly drew the Bloodwrought Bow again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, three Sacred Power Arrows were formed, still compressed Earth Arrows. They didn't emit strong Sacred Power fluctuations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were now aimed at three mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They instantly snapped out of their shock, feeling terrified. Without hesitation, they began retreating and fleeing frantically, trying to get back to the warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne had already fired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows were shot, each locking onto a target. No matter how those three pirates frantically fled or changed direction, they couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the speed of the Sacred Power Arrows was too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment they left the string, they had already entered Dimensional Space, appearing behind them as if by teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates were terrified at this moment. Realizing they couldn't evade, they could only desperately unleash Sacred Power, layering defenses around themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, they took out their Defensive Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were only low-grade, with their frantic activation, they could unleash powerful defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, the Sacred Power Arrows hit their defenses and quickly exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Booming sounds echoed one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows struck the enemies almost simultaneously and exploded. The terrifying blasts resembled starlight, briefly illuminating the dim cosmos before quickly fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bodies of those three mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates had been completely torn into countless pieces, drifting in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all dead!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Earth Arrow attack, they had tried their best to defend, but the power of the Earth Arrow's explosion still tore through their defenses and their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was once again shocked, especially the Skull Pirates. They looked as if they'd seen a ghost, terrified, but quickly snapped out of it and started fleeing frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry! Run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's terrifying. Both our leader and deputy leader are dead. Hurry, run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the remaining eight mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates and over twenty Inferior Sacred Artifact warships moved frantically, no longer daring to surround Osborne and the others. They only wished they could grow wings to escape faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they still had eight mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors and over two hundred primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, when they saw their leader and three deputy leaders easily killed by Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow, leaving not even their corpses behind, they were all terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in their eyes, Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow was like a weapon of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone targeted is doomed to die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Run! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the Skull Pirates and their warships were desperately trying to escape, but unfortunately, in Osborne's eyes, their speed was far too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to escape?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not that easy! You're pirates who live by plundering, so it's better for you to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh and drew the Bloodwrought Bow once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, fire ten arrows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the Bloodwrought Bow, ten Sacred Power Arrows quickly appeared, each formed by the extreme compression of Osborne's Sacred Power. Under normal circumstances, performing such an attack once would nearly deplete his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with the Chaotic Spiritual Root, he feared Sacred Power consumption the least.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power was endless!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whooshing sounds kept echoing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out, eight targeting the eight mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates, while the other two locked onto the two Inferior Sacred Artifact warships in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrows traveled interdimensionally, reaching their targets in the blink of an eye and striking them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten violent explosions erupted. The defenses of the last eight mid Empyrean Sacredness pirates were shattered, their bodies torn apart, floating in the starry sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, massive branches extended from the void, wrapping around their corpses and quickly disappearing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those were the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The corpses of these Empyrean Sacredness pirates could serve as its nourishment, helping it grow faster and better nurture Osborne's Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defensive shields of the two distant Inferior Sacred Artifact warships were also shattered by Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows. The terrifying force erupted, crushing and killing all the pirates aboard the warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warships lost power and drifted silently in the starry sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the branches of the Warfare Ancient Tree appeared out of thin air, sweeping away the pirates' corpses and the Sacred Artifact warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Earth Arrow, fire ten arrows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Earth Arrow, fire three arrows!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly drew the string of the Bloodwrought Bow. After firing twice in a row, the surroundings suddenly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The twelve mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors and over two hundred primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors of the Skull Pirates were all killed. The twenty-four Inferior Sacred Artifact warships also had their defenses broken and were swept away by the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for the scattered fragments of corpses floating in the starry sky, no one would have known that a pirate group, the Skull Pirates, had appeared here not long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the Bloodwrought Bow and revealed a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Done!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne saw the shocked expressions of Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Skull Pirates had twelve mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors, over two hundred primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and twenty-four Inferior Sacred Artifact warships, and all of them were wiped out by Osborne just like that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was still just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, not even reaching Empyrean Sacredness yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His power is terrifying, isn't it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Has he already become this powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Angela was the first to recover. She looked at Osborne seriously and said, "Osborne, I owe you an apology! I used to think that you would regret refusing to let Ms. Alba be your mentor! I thought you would quickly be defeated by Isa and Clarissa, no longer on the same level as them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now I know I was wrong! My previous thoughts were ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally understand why you kept refusing to be Ms. Alba's disciple, yet she still values you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because you're simply a monster!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
