  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's his mental state?" Gerardo suddenly asked, his anxiety evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well the side effects of the culture fluid. With the rapid pace of improvement, the pain Osborne was enduring was unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gerardo had added numerous ancient remedies to bolster mental resilience, he wasn't sure if they would be enough to help Osborne withstand the agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't stand it and suffered a mental breakdown too soon, his consciousness would be enslaved prematurely, preventing him from fully absorbing the energy from the culture medium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Osborne's physical strength would definitely not reach 109.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was likely to only reach 20 or 30, though it was already powerful enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when Lord had been in the culture medium for six days, on the verge of enslavement, his physical strength had only peaked at 4.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his consciousness was enslaved and he emerged from the culture tank, Lord's strength could not exceed 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given this, it would be impressive if Osborne managed to reach even 20 or 30.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But against the target of 109, that was not enough at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo did not want Osborne's consciousness to be enslaved too quickly. He hoped that Osborne could hold on longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician replied in surprise, "He's... very good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The pain he's enduring is at level 15. This is far beyond what an ordinary person could withstand. Even a Class S warrior would likely go insane under level 15 pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While his mental state is fluctuating wildly, it's still within a regular pattern, which means he's nowhere near a breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His tolerance for pain is truly astounding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Gerardo breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, his face lighting up with a grin, "Wonderful! That's just fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a gem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you and I have been rivals for decades, but I never expected you'd send me a treasure! He is your grandson, but from now on, he will be my sharpest weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He will soon become my Human Slave. I will train him to the best of my ability, </span><span>provide him with the finest resources, and ensure he grows as swiftly as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon, who in this world will stand against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helios Thornberry?" the technician asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, he&rsquo;s nothing. By then, the entire world will be mine!" Gerardo replied dismissively, brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed for an hour, confirming that Osborne's physical strength had indeed risen by one point, reaching 10 in an hour, and that his mental state showed no signs of collapse. Only then did he feel reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered, "Keep a close watch on him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inform me of any changes. We can't afford any mishaps, understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait here all the time. At the current rate of enslavement, Osborne would need at least 100 hours in the culture tank&mdash;over four days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was safe enough; with Osborne in the tank, escape was impossible. Gerardo didn't need to supervise him personally; he could check in from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Gerardo was gone, the vast room fell silent again, with only technicians bustling about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of culture tanks required monitoring, but the most crucial one contained Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three technicians stared at Osborne intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His physical strength is at 11!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's 12!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His strength has reached 20!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, his improvement rate has surged! It's gone from one per hour to 1.5 per hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, dear! The pain level he's enduring has hit 16! That's something even a Class S warrior couldn't withstand, and it could very well kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But his mental state remains stable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His physical strength is now 21.5!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's reached 23!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technicians recorded Osborne's physical data, expressing astonishment at the rapid developments. As they observed the slightly trembling Osborne in the culture tank, their eyes were filled with awe, as if they were looking at a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they recorded were merely cold numbers, but what Osborne was experiencing was a torment that could drive anyone mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he had completely lost track of time and even his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain consumed his consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt like a small boat tossed about in a vast ocean, where any wave could capsize him, plunging him into eternal darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even in such dire situation, he persisted, refusing to let his mind break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Extreme pain? He had faced it once before when Isa compressed the soul of his powers to its limits and fused it with his body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This minor discomfort couldn&rsquo;t beat him down!</span></p><div class="pagination">
