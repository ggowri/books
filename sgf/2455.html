  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He lost?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the contestants around Brenda were a bit stunned at this moment. However, Osborne was a state duel champion from Zephyr State. His victory was something many had anticipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no one expected him to win the fight with just one arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked way too easy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This </span><span>wa</span><span>s what happens when two people of completely different levels clash, like a grown man overpowering a baby&mdash;one move, and it</span><span> wa</span><span>s all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Brenda was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She widened her eyes. </span><span>The</span><span> relaxed expression </span><span>on her face </span><span>had vanished, replaced by a slightly serious look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne is really strong!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponent, after all, </span><span>wa</span><span>s a state duel champion and a strong contender for the top ten. Even if Brenda personally </span><span>fought him herself</span><span>, </span><span>it</span><span> wouldn&rsquo;t be this easy</span><span> to defeat him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, she wouldn&rsquo;t think that Osborne </span><span>was</span><span> stronger than her because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would only admit that his attack power </span><span>was</span><span> stronger than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But a person's strength </span><span>wa</span><span>sn't just about attack power; it</span><span> wa</span><span>s about the overall </span><span>strength</span><span>. Brenda </span><span>wa</span><span>s confident that her overall strength </span><span>wa</span><span>s still the best among the contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believe</span><span>d</span><span> that as long as she t</span><span>ook</span><span> action, she w</span><span>ould</span><span> easily defeat Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, she c</span><span>ould </span><span>not take action. Otherwise, according to the rules, her results would be disqualified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda snorted coldly, "Osborne, you're still so brutal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of disdain flashed in his eyes. He said, "Brenda, if you want to test me, then do it yourself! Stop sending others!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda snorted coldly, "Test you? You're overestimating yourself! You're no match for me! If it weren't for the rules, </span><span>I would crush you easily</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "Confidence is a good thing, but yours seems a bit ridiculous! Anyway, I don't want to waste words with you. Since you won't make a move, then stop bothering me. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda instantly </span><span>turned</span><span> furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never encountered a peer daring to speak to her </span><span>like this</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I am the prodigy of Skyearth Dominion, while Osborne is just a disciple of a Second-rate Power. How dare he tell me to get lost?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's asking for death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Brenda still remained calm. After all, she knew she couldn't take action herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Osborne, are you deliberately provoking me, trying to make me attack you? That way, the referee will disqualify me, and you'll have one less competitor, </span><span>and you can </span><span>mov</span><span>e</span><span> up in the rankings, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, I've seen through you. I won't fall for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're overthinking! Whether you</span><span> get</span><span> disqualified by the referee or not won't affect my ranking!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda sneered, "How ridiculous! Are you saying your ranking is already higher than mine?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I think so!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, many contestants around Brenda couldn't help but burst into laughter. They all looked at Osborne with mocking eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She laughed too, with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said coldly, "Osborne, your </span><span>strength</span><span> are indeed </span><span>impressive</span><span>, but are you seriously claiming your ranking will be higher than Brenda's? That's utterly ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have no idea how many resources and treasures Brenda has gained! This time in the zone duel, Brenda will definitely be the champion! And her score will leave the second place far behind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's one thing to brag about other stuff, but claiming your ranking can be higher than Brenda's?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're nothing but a joke!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly, it's hilarious! Osborne isn't part of our team, so he has no idea how strong Brenda is or how much she's gained!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda is definitely the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if Osborne is impressive, he's at best a top ten! Can his gains even be a tenth of Brenda's?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's laughter made Brenda look at Osborne with confidence and disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she figured it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time in the zone duel, Brenda gained immensely, not only because of her own strength but also because she united other participants, with an 800-person team supporting her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it happened again, she definitely wouldn't gain this much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In </span><span>that case</span><span>, she didn't believe Osborne's gains could compare to hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If his gains are even one-tenth of mine, that would be pretty good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In such a situation, there's really no need for me to test Osborne anymore. After all, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I am definitely </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the champion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she sneered coldly, "Osborne, soon you'll realize how ridiculous you are! Compete with me for ranking? You're not worthy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, the championship is definitely mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Oh really? I think you're way too confident! I bet you won't even make it to the top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, even Brenda couldn't help but burst into laughter, as she found Osborne's words utterly ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He said I can't win the championship, and even said I can't make it to the top three?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unless my results are disqualified, that's absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Among all the participants in the zone duel, no one could have gained more than </span><span style="font-style: italic;">me</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, let alone three people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She scoffed, "Osborne, I think you've lost your mind! You actually said I can't make it to the top three? Don't you like betting? How about we make a bet? If I get into the top three, I want your shield and bow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you dare to bet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda slightly raised her chin, looking at Osborne with a proud expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others also looked at him with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could he dare to bet? H</span><span>e was </span><span>just bragging! Now</span><span> that</span><span> Brenda</span><span> was offering him a</span><span> bet, he&rsquo;s probably already regretting it. He&rsquo;s likely thinking about how to save himself from embarrassment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How ridiculous! He actually said Brenda couldn't make it to the top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If anyone dares to bet with me on this, I can stake my life on it, because Brenda is definitely in the top three, and definitely the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd </span><span>murmured</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and said calmly, "You want to bet with me? You want my Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow? Then what if you lose? What can you bet with me? What can I get?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda quickly said, "What</span><span> do</span><span> you want</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>J</span><span>ust say it! Whatever you want to bet, I agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that</span><span>, she still looked full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "In that case, I want your Ice Scepter! If you dare to bet it, then I&rsquo;ll agree!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, if you don't dare, then just pretend I didn't say anything! You can also shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda immediately became nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Scepter?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's a Legendary Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is the Vice Leader of Skyearth Dominion, my master, who entrusted it to me. It doesn't fully belong to me yet. My master requires me to win the zone duel championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Only then will the Ice Scepter completely belong to me.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne actually wants me to use it as a wager?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda frowned tightly, feeling a bit hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Osborne's disdainful expression and thinking about her huge gains, she felt that no matter what, she absolutely couldn't fall out of the top three. She gritted her teeth instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Fine! I'll bet with you!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'm in the top three, your Warfare Shield and Bloodwrought Bow will both belong to me! If I'm not, then my Ice Scepter will be yours!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
