  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! If it comes down to it, I'll bail the second things get too hairy. I won't be a burden to you!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then locked his gaze on Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with fierce determination. "Eamon, right? I took down all twelve of your Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan! Now it's your turn! Come at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's expression darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes. During the brief moment of silence, he had attempted to reach out to the twelve Superior Deities, only to find himself completely cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hit him then&mdash;Osborne might not be lying after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Osborne had genuinely wiped out the twelve Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne dared to challenge him one-on-one meant Osborne had some serious power behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's fury surged like a tidal wave, and a murderous intent cloaked Osborne. Gritting his teeth, he hissed, "So, you want a duel? Fine! I'll grant your wish! For killing my twelve Superior Deities, you must die! The Augustine family will be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take your head! And no one will save you! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Eamon lunged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buy me ten breaths of time with those two women! In ten breaths, I'll make this guy pay!" he barked at Cedric and Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cedric and Evander exchanged a glance, their minds made up in an instant. Without hesitation, they charged at Divine Shadow and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, the three of them had struggled against Divine Shadow and God of Star as a team. Now, with only two left, they stood no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they could at least hold Divine Shadow and God of Star off for ten breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Divine Shadow and God of Star were stronger, they wouldn't be able to incapacitate Cedric and Evander in such a short time, nor could they rush to Osborne's aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star both scoffed, their hearts heavy with worry for Osborne. They poured their energy into their attacks, eager to dispatch their opponents quickly and come to his rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, as Eamon threatened to finish him off in ten breaths, Osborne couldn't help but let out a cold chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't taking it lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first encounter with a Transcendent Deity warrior, and he had no idea just how strong they truly were. He knew he had to give it his all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nightshade Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Massive wings with a </span><span>three hundred-yard</span><span> wingspan erupted behind Osborne, dark and imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, Eamon's attack came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nightshade Wings enveloped Osborne, absorbing Eamon's blow. But in an instant, the wings trembled violently before being ripped apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, a mix of surprise and concern washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Nightshade Wings had withstood the attacks of twelve Superior Deities without faltering, yet they had been torn apart so easily by Eamon's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Eamon's power had diminished significantly after breaking through the Nightshade Wings, and he lacked the strength to shatter Osborne's Ethereal Glow defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne staggered back a few steps but managed to regain his balance mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his Ethereal Glow and Nightshade Wings quickly restored themselves, a cold smile crept onto Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is the power of a Transcendent Deity warrior? Quite impressive, but it seems it still can't touch me! Eamon, if this is all you've got, I might have overestimated your strength! I have a feeling you're going to end up dead at my hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's fury boiled over at Osborne's taunt, but deep down, he couldn't shake off the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His previous attack, while not his full strength, was no joke. Any other Superior Deity would have found it a challenge to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, brushing it off like it was nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks had even failed to breach Osborne's Ethereal Glow defense, leaving Osborne's Divine Body unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit Eamon hard, and his expression grew grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Eamon stopped viewing Osborne as a foolish kid looking for death. Now, he saw Osborne as an opponent who stood on equal footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! I admit I underestimated you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you think stopping one of my attacks makes you my equal&mdash;or that you can kill me&mdash;you're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brace yourself, because now you're about to see my true strength! Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Eamon launched himself at Osborne once more. This time, a forceful surge of divine power emanated from him, ramping up his strength to a terrifying level. It whipped around him like a violent storm, charging straight toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare let his guard down; he raised his Nightshade Wings to absorb the initial onslaught. But as Eamon's strike hit home, the wings shattered, and he quickly resorted to his Ethereal Glow for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was vicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Eamon's strike broke through Osborne's Ethereal Glow, too, landing solidly on his Divine Body for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the blow against him, a small white mark seeping into the surface of his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't break the surface, not even enough to draw blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eamon? He stood there, wide-eyed and stunned, gaping at the minute white point on Osborne's Divine Body. His expression morphed into one of disbelief, completely caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I threw everything I had at you, yet I couldn't even scratch your Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be real!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
