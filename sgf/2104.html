  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught came from nearly a hundred opponents, all aimed squarely at Alfreda, while Osborne appeared as an invisible bystander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda showed no signs of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine power surged around her, crackling in the air as she pointed ahead. Instantly, countless emerald-green vines sprang forth, twisting and intertwining to form a formidable barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrage of attacks collided against the verdant shield, creating an earth-shattering noise, yet the barrier held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight sent shockwaves through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond shouted, anger lacing his voice, "Give it everything you've got!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's just an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have over a dozen Ascension Fives among us. If we can't take her down, we might as well just find a rock to bang our heads against!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The command reverberated as their assault intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda chuckled. "Too bad for you! I may be an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, but you lot are nothing compared to me! Let me show you how vast the gap can truly be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Amber!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda raised her hand, and streamers of light danced and sparkled between her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each streamer reflected ancient elven runes. As the light grew brighter, the group of people in front of Alfreda suddenly felt a distorted film of light materialize around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This light film coiled around their bodies, making them feel as if they were trapped in an inescapable cage. Dozens of people were simultaneously ensnared by the light film!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Temporal Amber, the deadly forbidden technique of the Nature Elf Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors of the Fire Elf Royal Family, both Ascension Fives and Fours, found themselves frozen mid-attack, their expressions shifting from confidence to terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda felt more formidable than even the Ascension Six Soulreaver Vine they had previously faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a dramatic twist, a thorny crown manifested on her smooth forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the green vines and branches around her came alive, now infused with a wild, lethal energy as they lunged towards the helpless warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines, now like the sharpest of weapons, swiftly pierced the throats and hearts of those trapped in the Temporal Amber's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They writhed in desperation, fighting to break free, but it was futile&mdash;they could only watch in horror as the vines struck with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over forty captured warriors had been dispatched, their bodies falling to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Desmond and Monica standing nearby in shocked silence, their expressions stark with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every pair of eyes locked onto Alfreda, the petite beauty now morphed into a terrifying specter&mdash;a demon reaping lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, usually so composed, felt shaken to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What incredible power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the first time he had witnessed Alfreda in action. Back in Elf City at the Emerald Forest Lodge, when Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley, all Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, had sought to join Alfreda's team, they looked down on Osborne for his low cultivation level, demanding that Alfreda remove him from the group&mdash;and had gone as far as to humiliate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Alfreda had chosen to stand up for him, overpowering the four and forcing them to apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, Osborne had sensed how formidable she really was&mdash;ordinary Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings were no match for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could see that her power had grown exponentially stronger, and he felt a swell of admiration mixed with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne had reached Ascension Two, he knew that without using the absolute forbidden zone to suppress Alfreda's power, he would still be no match for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "A typical Ascension Six wouldn't stand a chance against her! She just wiped out over forty elite guards from the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family, and at least three of them were Ascension Five...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impressive! No wonder she scored Class SS on the Astral Testing Arch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the entire cosmos, Alfreda's talent is top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, only those with Class SSS ratings are considered Celestial Progeny&mdash;those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with geniuses from the Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, and Angel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Alfreda unleash her might, Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how strong I've become since hitting Ascension Two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he pondered this, his chance arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princess Monica's sharp voice cut through the chaos. "Kill her! Take her down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Amber is a deadly forbidden technique of the Nature Elf Clan. She won't be able to perform it again in a short time. Kill her right away! Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was terrified; Alfreda's effortless slaughter of their ranks had left her feeling suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alfreda remained alive, she wouldn't find peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Monica's order, the remaining fifty warriors surged forward, eleven of them being Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Monica and Desmond joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they were all in, and Alfreda's expression hardened, her confidence replaced by a grave seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica was right; having already used Temporal Amber, she couldn't deploy it again for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that defense, facing such a relentless assault would be a monumental challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was quickly overwhelmed, her body hurled backward, her complexion paling as blood trickled from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing blood spill from Alfreda's mouth, Monica cackled with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, what's the matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how powerful you are, you're still just an Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, not an Ascension Six! You can't withstand our combined might! Die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, let's finish her off! Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining warriors, emboldened, unleashed a furious barrage of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Alfreda was sent flying, more blood spilling from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, four figures burst from the crowd, racing toward her with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley, their eyes burning with hatred and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you humiliated us in Elf City! You forced us to apologize to a worthless human! We've never forgotten that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We joined Prince Desmond's exploration team just to get our revenge! And now, the time has come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they launched their full force at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been at her peak, she would have brushed off their assault with ease. But now, injured and her divine power defenses shattered, she felt the weight of their combined strength. Alfreda's face paled as she struggled to fend them off, blood spilling from her lips once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wouldn't let up, intent on finishing her off for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!" Alfreda thought, panic creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a tall figure stepped in front of her, blocking Pierce and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked eyes with the four, his voice steady and calm. "I'm the so-called worthless human you've been talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your fight is with me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
