  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ignorant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood where he was, not bothering even to move, just bursting out with the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The orange Devil's Light bombarded Osborne's body, causing a ripple in his martial art aura, and then disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn suddenly panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You talk so arrogantly, yet that's all that you can do? And you said you were the third in the Power Prodigy Class? You can be considered a genius?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think you are not even as good as Alexander and Charlie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn became even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was five years younger than Alexander and Charlie, but she had already broken through to the Class A Power Master. How could she not be considered a genius?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! I'll kick your ass!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn attacked again in anger, and even more powerful Devil's Light came again at a breakneck speed, bombarding Osborne's martial art aura again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the martial art aura was stirred up with even more significant ripples and was almost penetrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "You actually combined advanced martial arts skills with your power and incorporated the Spiral Force into your power attack? And you have at least mastered the Spiral Force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that he had underestimated Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light, with the addition of the Spiral Force, had greatly enhanced its penetrating power. If it were a little stronger, it might be able to break through his defense and cause damage to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a good idea. I'll try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly waved his hand, the martial art aura around him flashed violently, and a burst of energy blasted towards Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's control, this energy actually operated using the spiral force technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's actually possible, and it's not difficult!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his attack hit Evelynn's Devil's Light defense, instantly breaking her defense and hitting her chest heavily, knocking her out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was spurting blood, her face pale, and she finally managed to stand steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You! How could you possibly do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was too astonished even to wipe the blood from the corner of her mouth and said to Osborne in shock, "Who taught you how to integrate advanced martial arts techniques into power attacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Why can't I do it? Is it that difficult? If I must say who taught me, I have to thank you. If you hadn't demonstrated it yourself, I wouldn't have thought that advanced martial arts techniques could be combined with the power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was shocked. "You learned it on the spur of the moment after watching </span><span>me</span><span> do it? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Believe it or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, too casual to talk nonsense with her, and said coldly, "Now, get out of here immediately! Because you are a member of the Augustine family in Newport City, I don't want to kill you, but if you stop me from killing them again, or dare to covet Clarissa's divine artifact, I won't show mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Evelynn glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare ask me to get out of here?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you're going to show no mercy?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm warning you. You can't keep that divine artifact! Even if I give up, there will be countless people coming to snatch it! You can't keep it at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coldly said, "Does that have anything to do with you? I will kill anyone who dares to come and rob us! Now, one last time, get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne walked towards Evelynn step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn panicked a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie gritted his teeth and immediately stood beside Evelynn, ready to work with her to rival Osborne. The other, although not yet Class A masters, also chose to stand up and help Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander and Wade, regaining their strength, stood by Evelynn, aware that her fall meant their certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn looked at the people around her and suddenly regained her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "Let's attack together! After all, he is just like us, only Class A. There are so many of us, so there is no way we can lose to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, they took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the injuries were ignored, their lineup was solid at this moment. Wade was a Class A+ master, and Alexander, Charlie, and Evelynn were all Class A, but not ordinary ones. They were all geniuses, and their strength was more potent than the average Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the remaining three were very close to Class A and ranked at the top of the Power Prodigy Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength was mighty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, most of them had been injured by Osborne at this time and had long lost their peak strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing them joining forces, Osborne was not afraid but instead sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if you attack together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, the martial art aura shone, and for the first time he used a high-level martial arts skill, Ninefold Tide Crash. His attack was like waves that exploded in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar never ceased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of his fist turned into seven waves, which eventually merged into one and became even more vital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne directly broke the combined power of these people. The considerable force blew them all away, causing them to vomit blood crazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They tumbled to the ground, struggling to stand, their faces pale with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chose to do it together but were still defeated head-on by Osborne's terrifying power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
