  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yale suddenly shouted, staring at the projection screen above him, his face extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because at this moment, it was Clara's turn to tally the scores.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's harvest was almost the same as Leroy's. She handed Ian a Dimensional Bag, and once it was opened, a flood of resources poured out like a tide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blocking out the sky, layer upon layer, it was almost identical to Leroy's earlier situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only were the spectators on Racial Convergence Planet stunned, but the contestants on Abyssal Planet, as well as Ian, were also shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's mouth twitched slightly, his face full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave Osborne a deep look, then quickly started calculating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 2.8 billion, but less than 2.9 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Clara and Osborne were in the same group, Ian knew what he had to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Clara, all the gains can be exchanged for 3 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Ian's words fell, everyone let out incredibly shocked exclamations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three billion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another three billion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A regular Legendary Sacred Artifact costs about one billion Sacred Crystals. However, in reality, it's tough to buy a Legendary Sacred Artifact for one billion Sacred Crystals because they are rare, and few are willing to sell them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with one billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, you can easily exchange for a Legendary Sacred Artifact from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Glorious Divine Kingdom does not lack Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this case, thirty billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for three regular Legendary Sacred Artifacts or one high-quality Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, countless people looked at Clara with envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Clara's name also appeared in the sky, alongside Leroy at the top of the leaderboard, dazzlingly brilliant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone turned to look at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Clara's ranking surpassed Brenda's, Brenda dropped to third place. Her face turned extremely grim, and she clenched her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could even see that her face looked somewhat pale at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was fear in her eyes as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew why Brenda was afraid&mdash;she was about to lose the bet with Osborne, and she was about to lose her Legendary Sacred Artifact...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Scepter!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne mocked at the right time. He laughed and said, "Brenda, your ranking seems about to drop out of the top three! I'm about to win the bet! Or, you can start praying to the gods now, praying that my gains will be less than yours? Praying that I won't rank higher than you? Praying that you can still hold onto third place?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne sneered, his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words caused many people to laugh, all looking at Brenda with mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Would Osborne's gains be less than Brenda's?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is that possible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew that Leroy and Clara had such gains because Osborne helped them. During the state duel, the two of them teamed up with Osborne, who carried them into the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was the one in a leading position among the three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara's scores were both 3 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, so Osborne's score...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only higher!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The resources and treasures Osborne gained, which can be exchanged for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, would only be more than Leroy and Clara's. Now the only question is, what will Osborne's final score be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>4 billion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>5 billion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>6 billion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or more?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one can guess, even Ian is a bit curious now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Osborne but didn't dare to urge him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply looked at Brenda playfully and said, "Brenda, I am the witness to the bet between you and Osborne! So, if you fall out of the top three, you lose the bet! As agreed, your Ice Scepter will belong to Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He added, "I hope you can be honest and not play any tricks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Brenda's face turned even paler.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body swayed, almost falling. She just felt deeply regretful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I going to lose? No!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda gritted her teeth. "No! I won't lose! I can't lose! I must not lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda glared angrily at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I haven't lost yet! Let's talk after your results are tallied!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, I'll make your loss crystal clear! You think you've gained a lot? You think the championship is yours? In reality, you're just a joke! Now, take a good look..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, everyone felt the sky darken abruptly. Various resources and treasures, like dark clouds, covered the entire sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Leroy and Clara's gains were just a small dark cloud, then Osborne's gains were a massive dark cloud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gains were simply overwhelming!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large number of Abyssal Snake poison glands!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of Bloody Ivy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large number of Eaglebeak Moth wings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large number of Tigerstripe Bee stingers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of Abyssal Snake Slough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large number of Empyrean Sacredness bones from the Abyssal Clan!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And millions, even tens of millions, of Ice Beetle corpses!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked up at the sky, their faces full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How many could this be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Many! Too many! I'm afraid all of our gains combined aren't this much! No, maybe even half of his!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Terrifying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What exactly did he go through? How could he get so many resources? Especially those Ice Beetle corpses, there must be at least over ten million, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nearly fifteen million!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My God, just the Ice Beetles alone can exchange for nearly 30 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Crazy! Completely insane!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An illusion, this must be an illusion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was going crazy at this moment, some hysterical, unwilling to believe this was real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, this is real.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this is not all of Osborne's harvest. At least, Osborne still has nearly over two thousand Beast Soul Flowers yet to be taken out. Moreover, in Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, there are tens of millions of Ethereal Blooms that he hasn't picked yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, those advanced Empyrean Sacredness and above Abyssal Clan Empyrean Sacredness corpses were also not taken out by Osborne; they were all fed to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this is just a part of Osborne's harvest. He hasn't taken out the truly valuable and useful items yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The items he took out are all things that don't help improve his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne's achievements would be much higher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it's already scary enough now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and looked at the equally stunned Brenda, calmly saying, "Brenda, how do you feel now? I told you, you wouldn't even make it to the top three! I really don't know what made you so arrogant before! Now, you've lost! So according to our bet, you can obediently hand over the Ice Scepter! I should thank you for giving me a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
