  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to pull out all the stops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing an opponent like Terrence, holding back wasn't an option. Even at full power, there was no guarantee he could truly harm Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's dark and spatial elemental essences, which had already peaked at Level Five, could unleash a devastating might that even Terrence couldn't ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence, a seasoned warrior, knew better than to let the Abyssal Spiral and Space Collapse continue to build. If they reached their peak strength, even his divine power defenses and Divine Body would be overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Terrence struck back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power erupted with terrifying force, standing toe-to-toe with the Abyssal Spiral's massive suction power, which now spanned six miles. Terrence's divine power surged and ebbed, disrupting the vortex's smooth operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once fluid Abyssal Spiral now faltered and began to crumble on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can break the Abyssal Spiral like that? No wonder he reached Deity Overlord's pinnacle. His tactics and experience far surpass mine. He doesn't need direct confrontation. Just disrupting its flow can cause the Abyssal Spiral to collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal Abyssal Spiral, painstakingly conjured by Osborne, disintegrated in a cataclysmic blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Space Collapse erupted around Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked his gaze on Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how you handle my Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scoffed, "Your Space Collapse promises a grim future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The entire expanse of space is collapsing, threatening to shred my divine defenses and shatter my Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your elemental essence must be at Level Five's peak. To reach that level as an Intermediate Deity is nothing short of monstrous. Few Transcendent Deities can match that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And your power, spatial power, one of the rarest and most potent, is truly enviable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But such an attack won't be enough to defeat me. After all, I once stood at the peak of Deity Overlord. My power level... is Level Six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden flourish, Terrence commanded, "Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the collapsing space halted, blanketed in countless crystalline shards of ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These frigid shards immobilized everything around, even the space itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Six ice elemental essence?! It can freeze collapsing space itself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew more somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated Terrence wielding a Level Six ice elemental essence, a power that nullified his Space Collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence had never used it before, relying on his robust divine power and mighty Divine Body to vanquish foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ice elemental power, though not rare or particularly formidable, proved highly effective against spatial powers at Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even suspected it could counter his interdimensional travel and Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out," he muttered and vanished into a parallel dimension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reappearing beside Terrence with the Goddess of Grain's scythe in hand, Osborne prepared to strike a surprise blow to Terrence's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Terrence merely scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he couldn't see Osborne, he guessed Osborne had used spatial power to ambush him. So, he acted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sphere of white ice crystals, stretching several hundred yards around Terrence, emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped as he realized he was trapped, unable to exit the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space was indeed frozen solid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a radius of several hundred yards, even with his spatial power, Osborne found himself unable to come and go as he pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial power that once was his greatest asset was now rendered useless, preventing him from sneaking up within a few hundred yards of Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization left Osborne utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once formidable advantages, techniques like the Abyssal Spiral and Space Collapse, had been unraveled by Terrence. Now, even the possibility of a surprise attack was off the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What other options did Osborne have to defeat Terrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confrontation head-on? That was out of the question!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's divine power far surpassed that of an ordinary Transcendent Deity warrior. Any direct attack from Osborne would not only fail to penetrate Terrence's defenses but would also recoil back onto him, overwhelming his current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Osborne retreated, emerging from the parallel space to face Terrence with a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he found himself at a loss, unable to conceive a plan. Terrence, like a hard-shelled turtle, remained impervious to Osborne's various tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle suddenly came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence scoffed, saying, "Osborne, it seems that your abilities are nothing more than this! I've won."</span></p><div class="pagination">
