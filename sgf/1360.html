  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Augustine family gathered to bid farewell to Osborne, Sebastian, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, I'm leaving the Augustine family in your hands!" Osborne said, his tone serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew nodded vigorously, his expression grave. "Don't worry, Godfather! I'll do everything I can to protect the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all stay safe out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you've settled in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, make sure to come back to Blue Planet and bring us along! We want to see what </span><span>Celestara</span><span> is like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly scanned the faces of the Augustine family before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following closely behind him were Sebastian, Anastasia, Zoe, Yulissa, Queenie, Nathan, Bryce, and Kendra, all of them disappearing swiftly from the sight of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they had been gone for quite some time that the Augustine family members began to disperse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Sebastian stood beside Osborne, hidden in the parallel space. Once the Augustine family members had finally scattered, he couldn't help but let out a sigh, a hint of sadness etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Osborne, Sebastian had a much deeper emotional connection to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of parting ways with them and heading into the unknown of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> weighed heavily on his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Grandpa! We'll establish ourselves in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> quickly! Once we do, we'll come back and bring everyone over, making the Augustine family the strongest family in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!" Osborne reassured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's mood lifted a bit at this, and he smiled, "Alright! But you've got to put in the effort! </span><span>Celestara</span><span> is no Blue Planet. Making the Augustine family the strongest there will depend on you; I can only support you! But I believe you can do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Sebastian gave Osborne's shoulder a firm pat. "Let's go! It's time to set off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled back, "No rush; we've got a few more people joining us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few more people?" Sebastian asked, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, three figures appeared, moving quickly toward them&mdash;God of Star, Divine Shadow, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second..." Sebastian exclaimed, narrowing his eyes at Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this woman? She looks so familiar! There's something about her that feels incredibly known to me, yet I'm sure I've never met her before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering, he stepped out of the parallel space, bringing the others with him to stand before Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their sudden appearance startled Divine Shadow. When she saw Sebastian standing beside Osborne, her expression changed dramatically, and she almost turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she began to turn, Osborne called out with a grin, "Grandma Divine Shadow, where do you think you're going? We're heading to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! You're not having second thoughts, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Divine Shadow froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, on the other hand, was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Shadow?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really Divine Shadow?! No wonder I felt that strange familiarity! You can take human form? And you look so young!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's surprise was palpable as he stared at Divine Shadow's face, unable to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a young age, he had treated Divine Shadow as a pet, and she had been a part of his life for as long as he could remember. With her, Sebastian had no secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he had thought of Divine Shadow as just a cat, so he never felt anything extraordinary about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was shocked to discover that she could transform into a human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what a stunning human she was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow stood frozen, her cheeks flushing slightly under Sebastian's intense gaze. Unable to help herself, she shot a fierce glare at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft, almost inaudible "Mmhmm," she consented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, finding the confirmation, was once again stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An awkward tension suddenly filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the need to break the silence, Osborne quickly said, "Grandpa, Grandma Divine Shadow, let's walk and talk, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then tore through the fabric of space, and in the blink of an eye, the group found themselves at the vast chasm of </span><span>Felona</span><span>&mdash;a distance of over six thousand miles traversed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "This is it! The shortest route to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> lies here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can create a temporary dimensional portal right into </span><span>Celestara</span><span> from this very spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we know nothing about </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Once the portal is open, everyone, enter my Dimensional Microcosm; I'll take us all in together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne set to work. Drawing upon the collective power of the Blood Demon members, his realm soared to the peak of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dimensional portal he conjured stretched deep, reaching a staggering depth of 120 thousand miles without hitting a limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at nearly 140 thousand miles, he encountered a barrier&mdash;the very boundary of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All it took was the right application of spatial power to breach this barrier, and they </span><span>would be one step closer to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it," he thought, his expression shifting to one of utmost seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, be ready! We're about to cross into </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
