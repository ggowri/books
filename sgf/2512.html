  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to leave, a middle-aged woman appeared in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This middle-aged woman was also an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman seemed to hold a slightly higher status than Romina. Her face was grim as she questioned, "Romina, what's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina replied, "Ms. Gibbs, there was an unexpected situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia Gibbs's expression darkened further as she said coldly, "How could such a mistake happen? This person's death doesn't matter. After all, he was already drained by the leader's tentacles. But the loss of the Bewitching Lantern is unforgivable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Losing a Bewitching Lantern could very likely cause flaws in the leader's upcoming plan. The leader has been preparing for this plan for thousands of years. Whether he can break through Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior depends on this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And yet you lost a Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know how many people will enter the Phantomagic Realm this time? At least hundreds of thousands, all above Empyrean Sacredness. According to our intelligence, there are already over twenty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors, hundreds of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, and thousands of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the leader can only rely on ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns to form the Bewitching Formation to ensure they can be eliminated. Now, because you lost one Bewitching Lantern, the Bewitching Formation has a flaw."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia glared angrily at Romina. "How will you explain this to the leader? If the leader's plan goes wrong, can you bear the responsibility? Just wait to be drained by the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, Romina's face was filled with fear. "Don't worry, Dalia. I've already sealed the Blossom Cage; no one can leave, not even a fly. I will definitely retrieve the Bewitching Lantern and ensure the leader's plan is not ruined!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let&rsquo;s hope so!" Dalia said coldly. "Now, mobilize all forces. The Bewitching Lantern must be retrieved! Even if it means killing all the guests in the Blossom Cage, it must be found!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, once the leader's plan succeeds, the Blossom Cage will no longer be necessary. By then, the leader will take us away from this damned edge of the universe to a more prosperous place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dalia quickly left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina's face darkened as she ordered, "Keep searching. No matter what, the Bewitching Lantern must be found! If it can't be found, then kill all the guests in the Blossom Cage&mdash;don't let a single one escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Instantly, a new round of searching began in the Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, it was to find the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the small courtyard, Osborne's face was extremely grim, and Dalia and Romina's conversation kept flashing through his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bewitching Lantern is very important.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the Blossom Cage has a total of ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns. He plans to use them to form a Bewitching Formation and strike against everyone else in the Phantomagic Realm?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Phantomagic Realm is likely a conspiracy. A scheme the leader of Blossom Cage has been preparing for thousands of years. Even the news about the Phantomagic Realm appearing near Inferno Planet was personally leaked by the leader of Blossom Cage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His goal is to attract more people here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't overheard Dalia and Romina's conversation, he would definitely have entered the Phantomagic Realm three days later, only to be caught off guard, manipulated by the leader of Blossom Cage, and possibly drained completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Fortunately, now that I know this is the leader of Blossom Cage's conspiracy, I can prepare in advance. I still have to go to the Phantomagic Realm. After all, the mid-to-high-ranking members of the Frenetic Storm Warband will be there, and I must capture them all in the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, the Dragon Elixir from the Phantomagic Realm will greatly benefit my strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne silently made a decision. "I need to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He called Drum back, then entered Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, allowing Drum to quietly carry them through Blossom Cage's two layers of powerful defense shields and leave Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shortly after, Drum returned to Angela and Agatha's small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coming out of the Dimensional Microcosm, Osborne went straight to Angela and explained the situation inside Blossom Cage. Angela was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three days later, the Phantomagic Realm will open. Don't go in. Wait for me outside. Whether I can make it out alive depends on you," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded. "Don't worry. I'll do as you say. That demonic cultivator must die! I won't let his plan succeed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling reassured. "Let's go. We'll leave Vice City first. The entire Vice City is under Blossom Cage's control. If I disappear from Blossom Cage without a trace, it will definitely raise suspicion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm worried that the people from Blossom Cage will come looking for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll leave Vice City first and head to the southern hemisphere of Inferno Planet to wait for the Phantomagic Realm to appear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three immediately left the small courtyard, quickly returned to the location of the Cosmic Translocator, and departed through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after they left, Romina finally searched Osborne's Courtyard No. 9 again. But when she entered, she couldn't help but freeze, as Osborne had disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Celia and scolded, "Where is the guest of Courtyard No. 9? Why isn't he in the courtyard?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celia was also puzzled. "I don't know. I've been guarding outside Courtyard No. 9 the whole time, and no one has come out. The guest of Courtyard No. 9 hasn't left the courtyard at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He hasn't left the courtyard? Then how did he disappear? Could he silently pass through the defense shield here?" Romina asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression suddenly changed. She suddenly understood a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! The one who stole the Bewitching Lantern, took Layne away, and killed him is the guest of Courtyard No. 9! He has special means to silently pass through our defense shield!" Romina's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, he has probably already left Blossom Cage. Everyone, go find him! Even if you have to search every corner of Vice City and Inferno Planet, you must find that person!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go find him now!" Romina shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, she had a bad feeling. The fact that he could silently pass through Blossom Cage's defense shield and escape meant he wouldn't be easy to catch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought the Bewitching Lantern was probably lost for good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Romina showed a terrified expression, but she still clenched her teeth and took the initiative to contact the leader of Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Something happened at Blossom Cage! A Bewitching Lantern is missing and might be lost for good. I'm deeply sorry!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
