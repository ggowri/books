  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hold out for half an hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's shoulders dropped with relief at the news that the Augustine family reinforcements would arrive in thirty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Lambert family mobilizing their entire clan&mdash;nearly a thousand strong&mdash;he felt a surge of confidence. As a superpower, the Lambert family was no lightweight; they boasted over a hundred Class AA and more than thirty Class AAA fighters, including himself and Roy, both Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson believed that enduring half an hour might not be too daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't as optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, thirty minutes might seem quick to the untrained eye, but for true elites, it was more than enough time to decimate the Lambert family's forces again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself felt confident that he could wipe out the Lambert family's troops within that half hour if given the opportunity, let alone Sin and Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, holding out for thirty minutes? That was no small feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they were out in the open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family had no solid cover; the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins could launch attacks from any direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they were all Class AAA operatives, masters of stealth and assassination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even fighters like Rhett and Stuart would be in serious jeopardy facing them in the wild. The only real threats to the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization operatives were Osborne and the Class S duo, Greyson and Roy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if a Class S assassin from </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> showed up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would spell serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression tightened as he scanned the surroundings. His eyes landed on a towering mountain hundreds of yards away. A flicker of hope ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lambert, we need to get everyone to that mountain! Let's use it as our defensive stronghold! If we can back ourselves against it, we can limit attacks to just three directions. You, I, and Sir Lambert can each cover one of those flanks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's eyes lit up with understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great idea! I'll arrange that right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, the Lambert family convoy sprang into action, making their way to the base of the mountain. They positioned themselves in a semi-circle in front </span><span>of a sheer rock face, with hundreds of vehicles forming a makeshift barricade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne felt a familiar, unsettling ripple in the space around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here!" Osborne warned, taking his place at the frontline of the makeshift defense, flanked by Greyson and Roy, each on one side, ready for an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's words, everyone tensed, their senses on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They peered into the depths of the forest but saw nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, we can't see anything!" Greyson </span><span>frowned,</span><span> frustration evident in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was a Class S warrior, he couldn't penetrate the stealth of the Class AAA </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins. He'd only sense them when they got within 100 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy was in the same predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, unease weaving through the air as they listened to the distant sounds of insects, the buzz growing quieter&mdash;it was a telltale sign that something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barked his orders with urgency, "Stay calm! The nearest enemy is still about five hundred yards away. Do we have any water elemental metahumans with us? Start erecting water walls around the perimeter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's strength lies in their ability to ambush and assassinate. While the water walls won't stop them outright, any enemies that breach them will reveal their positions. As soon as we see them cross those walls, we strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson quickly connected the dots. "Benjamin, Adrian, Ethan! You three specialize in water elemental powers&mdash;get to it now, just like Godfather commanded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set up more water walls! Don't worry about the mental strength strain; as long as we hold out for half an hour, reinforcements will arrive! Everyone else, be ready! If the water walls fall, we'll need to swap in fire walls, earth walls, wind walls&mdash;anything to patch the gaps. We cannot let the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins approach us without a sound!" Greyson's voice rang out, firm and urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the Lambert family sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water walls sprang up hundreds of yards away, interlocking to form a protective circle around them. These barriers were tenuous, mere wisps of mist coalescing together, lacking real defensive power. However, they served a crucial purpose: any </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization killer that dared to breach them would set off ripples in the air, revealing their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne sensed the increasing array of faint spatial fluctuations around them, his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization killers coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He counted at least fifty already, with more numbers swelling the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they charge us all at once, we might hold them off, but at a heavy cost&mdash;there will be plenty of casualties! We need to thin their numbers first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne drew out his super energy pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinpointed a wavering fluctuation about five hundred yards away, the telltale sign of a concealed </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined squeeze of the trigger, a divine power bullet shot forward, zipping </span><span>through the air with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killer, caught mid-stealth, suddenly jerked back, his body contorting as a brutal blood hole erupted in his head, gray matter and crimson splattering the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, three more assassins nearby crumpled to the ground, their stealth shattered and surprise painted across their faces like a silent scream.</span></p><div class="pagination">
