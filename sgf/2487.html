  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Frederick entering Necropolis City to achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne became very serious and clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I absolutely cannot let Frederick achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was Osborne's father in his previous life and one of the people he hated the most.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was not only because, as a father, Frederick never intervened or offered any help when Osborne was beaten and humiliated by other princes, princesses, or even their servants, but also because of Frederick's indifference toward Osborne's mother, Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne was originally just Frederick's maid but was forcibly taken by him, leading to Osborne's birth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick never gave Vivienne any status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After giving birth to Osborne, Vivienne remained a maid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was precisely why Osborne was always regarded as a bastard by other princes and princesses and constantly bullied and humiliated by them. If Frederick had been willing to give Vivienne a proper status, all the suffering Osborne endured would not have happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick did not do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Vivienne was framed. Anyone with eyes could clearly sense something was wrong, but Frederick did not conduct any investigation. Instead, he directly ordered Vivienne's execution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although after Vivienne's death, Frederick kindly allowed her to be buried in the Royal Sepulcher, effectively acknowledging her status, to Osborne, it was meaningless and far too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Vivienne was already dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it was Frederick who personally ordered her execution. So, what was the point of allowing her to be buried in the Royal Sepulcher?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne would rather Vivienne be buried in an ordinary place, never again associated with the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family or Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Osborne deeply hated Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already made up his mind. After the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, he would pay his respects to Vivienne in the Royal Sepulcher. Then, upon reaching Empyrean Sacredness, he would begin his revenge plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who once beat and humiliated his mother and him were all targets of his revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who framed Vivienne must die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, his most important target for revenge was Frederick. After all, it was Frederick who personally ordered Vivienne's execution. He was the direct murderer of Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne planned to take revenge on Frederick last because Frederick was very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, already infinitely close to true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. On Racial Convergence Planet, only Anthony of Evernight Court and Russell of Phantom Commerce Guild could compare to him. The three of them were the strongest on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana was no match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne planned to seek revenge on Frederick last. He wanted Frederick to personally pay tribute to Vivienne and repent to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne felt a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Frederick reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I won't be able to take revenge on him. The strength of a warrior at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness far surpasses that of a warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Frederick is obsessed with enhancing his power. If he reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, he can pass through the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, enter deeper into the cosmos, and continue to grow stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the cosmos is vast. Once Frederick leaves Racial Convergence Planet and enters deeper into the cosmos through the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, it will be nearly impossible for me to find him again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, I must stop Frederick from reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. I absolutely cannot let Frederick gain power in Necropolis City. I have to sabotage Frederick's plans."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists and made a decision in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong? What are you thinking about?" Adriana asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words interrupted Osborne's thoughts, bringing him back to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly shook his head. "Ms. Alba, thank you for reminding me. Don't worry. Since this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel offers me a great opportunity, I definitely won't miss it. Before entering that place, I won't raise my cultivation level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded. "I came mainly to tell you this, so you don't raise your cultivation level before participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and miss this opportunity. Also, there's one more thing I need to tell you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Adriana curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to return to Mystic Sirius Sect because Mystic Sirius Sect no longer exists," Adriana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mystic Sirius Sect no longer exists? What's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit anxious. "Ms. Alba, what do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said, "Mystic Sirius Sect has been destroyed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne was even more shocked. "Mystic Sirius Sect has been destroyed? Who did it? Who did Mystic Sirius Sect offend? Why destroy Mystic Sirius Sect? What about Ms. Olsen? Is she okay? Also, I have a friend in Mystic Sirius Sect named Agnes. Is she alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very anxious, thinking, "When I came to participate in the zone duel, Mystic Sirius Sect was still very peaceful. I also hadn't heard of Mystic Sirius Sect having any enemies. How could Mystic Sirius Sect be destroyed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ms. Olsen should be fine, right? Also, Agatha, who goes by the alias Agnes, is still cultivating at my place. She wouldn&rsquo;t be in trouble, would she?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana smiled and said, "You're actually worried about Angela. Not bad. But you don't need to worry. Angela is fine. Mystic Sirius Sect was destroyed because of Angela."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Angela uncovered evidence of Mystic Sirius Sect colluding with a slave trafficking organization, so I personally killed all the senior members of Mystic Sirius Sect and everyone involved in the slave trade."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Angela is, of course, fine. If your friend wasn't involved in the slave trade, she should be fine too. However, Mystic Sirius Sect has already disbanded, and all the disciples have left. You can reach out to your friend to check on her situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was stunned, thinking, "Ms. Olsen found evidence of Mystic Sirius Sect colluding with a slave trafficking organization, and then Ms. Alba personally destroyed Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Ms. Olsen didn&rsquo;t accompany me to the zone duel. She said she had important matters to handle. Turns out, this was what she meant. No wonder I didn&rsquo;t see Mystic Sirius Sect&rsquo;s leader Lenny after returning from Abyssal Planet. Most likely, Lenny had already been killed by Ms. Olsen at that time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly figured out a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When on Celestara Planet, Osborne already knew that Mystic Sirius Sect was connected to the slave trafficking organization. After all, among the slaves sold by Paramount Supreme Clan from Celestara Planet, some were sold to Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He deserved it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he wasn&rsquo;t worried about Agatha. After all, she had just joined Mystic Sirius Sect, so she would naturally be fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne planned to contact her after returning to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at Adriana and asked, "Ms. Alba, do you despise slave trafficking organizations?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana's eyes turned cold. "Of course. Anyone involved in slave trafficking deserves to die. As long as I know and have solid evidence, I will kill everyone I encounter who is connected to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's face was filled with an icy killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit excited. "Ms. Alba, I know who the biggest slave trafficking organization is in this Stellar Region of Racial Convergence Planet. But I don't have solid evidence yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can help me find a Stellar Exploration Organization called Frenetic Storm Warband, I might be able to gather some evidence."</span></p><div class="pagination">
