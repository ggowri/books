  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda could sense the sincerity radiating from the three newcomers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't mind Osborne being part of the team, nor did they hesitate to offer their protection for him while they ventured into Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't an act; they genuinely meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart swelled with joy. This was the kind of camaraderie she needed. Even though Avery, Godfrey, and Hermione might not possess the same level of talent as Nell and her crew, Alfreda didn't hesitate to nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Since you all accept, welcome to the Alfreda Exploration Team! Now we have five members!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Avery! Godfrey! Hermione! We're thrilled to have you on board!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda extended her hand, and the three eagerly shook it, then turned to Osborne, offering him the same warm greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of relief; they didn't look down on him for his lower cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That surprised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you three a fixed team?" he couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we've been together for over fifty years! We trust each other completely, and our teamwork is top-notch!" Avery said, her voice steady and confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast to Godfrey, who spoke like a machine, and Hermione, whose voice was childlike, Avery clearly took the lead among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, she seemed to naturally care for her two companions, both of whom were Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she were the big sister looking after the "two kids" who didn't quite grasp the weight of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was impressed with Avery right off the bat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said, "It's getting late, and I doubt anyone else will show up tonight. Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, why don't you stay here for the night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow is the last day for recruitment! Regardless of whether we find more warriors, we'll be heading into Umbra Earth the day after!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio nodded eagerly. "Sure thing, Captain! We're with you all the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally securing new teammates, even if it was just three, Alfreda was thrilled. She arranged for them to have the best wooden cabins in the inn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the night passed, the atmosphere was filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Alfreda chose to stay at the Emerald Forest Lodge instead of heading to the Combat Arena, waiting for others to come to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Avery, Godfrey, and Hermione seemed to be training fanatics, immersing themselves in their practice without interfering with Alfreda's recruitment efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, staying nearby, could feel the powerful energy radiating from their cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings and one Ascension Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they now had five members, Alfreda knew it wasn't enough. Compared to the exploration teams of other princes and princesses, their strength was still lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of those teams boasted around a hundred members, including fifty elite royal guards, primarily at Ascension Four and Five levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other fifty comprised warriors from World of Racial Convergence, their strengths varying widely&mdash;some reaching Ascension Six while others barely scraped by at Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for anyone below Ascension Three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a soul in sight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was set to be the weakest among all who would enter Umbra Earth, and the gap in cultivation levels was daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel a bit helpless. Once he broke through to Supernal Deity King, advancing further seemed nearly impossible. Even with his Infinite Devouring Eyes constantly absorbing and breaking down energy, reaching Ascension Two would still take a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave as he stepped out of his cabin, his thoughts racing. "I just hope I can find a way to quickly break through my cultivation level while in Umbra Earth. I only have a month, and this is my last chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I come up empty-handed in Umbra Earth, then the Human Community in Celestara is in serious trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, he sought out Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, nearly a hundred warriors from World of Racial Convergence arrived at the Emerald Forest Lodge, eager to join her exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most of them fell short of her standards, and Alfreda quickly turned them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only a little over twenty warriors met her criteria, but even among those, she rejected the majority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She declared, "I can sense ill intentions from these folks. They're not genuinely interested in joining us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Alfreda decided to keep just four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these four were two members of the Human Community: Neville Hager and his sister, Arabela Hager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King specializing in fire power, was the older brother, while Arabela, an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King focusing on thunder power, was the younger sibling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both had a total score of Class B on the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Arabela didn't technically qualify due to her lower cultivation level, Alfreda made an exception for her brother's sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third recruit was Beverly Hinchcliffe from the Shadow Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had initially joined Desmond's exploration team, but after Nell and her crew&mdash;Pierce, Killian, and Harley&mdash;joined as well, Beverly opted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a personal vendetta against Nell and didn't want to be on the same team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that Nell had faced setbacks with Alfreda, Beverly decided to throw her lot in with Alfreda's team instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King with a total score of Class A on the Astral Testing Arch, putting her strength on par with Nell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last member was Cyrus Merouin, a seemingly simple-minded genius from the Beast Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his humble appearance, he was no slouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Five Supernal Deity King specializing in earth power, he excelled in defense and also boasted a total score of Class B on the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night fell, no one else arrived at Emerald Forest Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roster for the exploration team was set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine members strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team included Alfreda, Osborne, Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, Neville, Arabela, Beverly, and Cyrus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Osborne was the only one at Ascension One, while Avery and Arabela were both at Ascension Four. The rest were all Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their scores on the Astral Testing Arch were nothing short of impressive&mdash;most of them were Class A, with the lowest being Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength and talent were undeniably top-tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the one glaring weakness of Alfreda's exploration team was its size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their exceptional abilities, the team barely scraped together ten members, a stark contrast to the hundred-strong squads led by the other princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda asked, her enthusiasm evident, "How do you feel about nine members?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine is plenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, we're heading into Umbra Earth, and we'll break right through! We'll gather every treasure we can find!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's excitement was contagious as she clinked glasses with each team member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched her, unable to suppress a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his glass filled with sparkling green Elf Water and felt a flicker of anticipation deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow, they would set off for Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Umbra Earth was a treasure trove of wonders, a mysterious realm brimming with artifacts from the Umbra World. Whether it was the Soul of Umbra Earth, Element Gold Crystals, Sacred Elixirs, Sacred Crystals, or even Apex divine artifacts and Sacred Artifacts, everything there could enhance his strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to make sure I come away with something significant from Umbra Earth to boost my power!" Osborne vowed silently to himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
