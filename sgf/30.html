  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but sneer when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley didn&rsquo;t know that the balance in Osborne&rsquo;s account was not only 50 million dollars but nearly 150 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was more, the Draco Auction House was the Godfather&rsquo;s property, and the Godfather was Osborne&rsquo;s biological grandfather, so he wasn&rsquo;t hesitant to spend money there. No matter how much money Osborne spent here, the money would all be his sooner or later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Wesley, the more he spent, the more Osborne earned from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley dared to compete with Osborne to see who would spend more money at the auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was simply courting death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Wesley jokingly without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley thought Osborne was scared, so he regained his confident look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The treasure auction began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, the auctioneer was not Debbe but a young and beautiful woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first lot was a rare jewel, Ocean Whisper Sapphire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The starting price was 20 million dollars, and the increment was no less than five million dollars for each bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, the auction became lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was not interested in the jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia bid for the Ocean Whisper Sapphire. However, when the price reached 40 million dollars, she had to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had prepared 50 million dollars to attend the auction, and her target was the Ocean Whisper Sapphire. However, she spent 20 million dollars to buy the opportunity to have lunch with Clarissa from Osborne, so she had no money left to buy jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, even if she hadn&rsquo;t spent 20 million dollars, 50 million dollars would not be enough to buy the Ocean Whisper Sapphire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the end, Clarissa bought the Ocean Whisper Sapphire for 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this a truly loaded person? She spent 100 million dollars on a piece of jewelry without hesitation as if spending ten dollars on a towel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After buying the Ocean Whisper Sapphire, Clarissa left with her bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne did not follow her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His second test as successor required him to get close to Clarissa and stay with her. Even if he followed her now, it would be impossible for him to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His chance came when he had lunch with Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was more, Osborne had to bid for a longevity herb to prolong Anastasia&rsquo;s life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The auction continued, and treasures were bought by the big shots in Mayby City for millions of dollars or even tens of millions of dollars, which really stunned Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, a longevity herb, which had the effect of prolonging life, was put on the auction block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, those older people became excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sat up straight and stared at the longevity herb with sharp eyes. &ldquo;Here it is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The beautiful auctioneer began to introduce the effects of the longevity herb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those present were all big shots, worth billions of dollars. When they had more money than they could spend, what they cared about most was naturally living longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were all familiar with longevity herbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were very few longevity herbs on the market. One was because they were really rare, and the other was that once they appeared, the big shots would immediately buy them at high prices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only at this kind of top-level auction would longevity herbs be auctioned occasionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All the big shots were waiting to bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For them, spending money to prolong their lives was a very worthwhile thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, this 300-year-old ginseng can cure diseases and increase lifespan. The starting price is three million dollars, and each bid must not be less than 200 thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as the auctioneer finished speaking, the fierce bidding began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;$3.2 million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;$3.5 million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;$3.8 million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;$4 million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the price soared to $5 million, with no sign of stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;$6 million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Ophelia raised the bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned. Why was Ophelia bidding for the longevity herbs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was a little curious. &ldquo;Why are you bidding for the longevity herb? We are young, and we don&rsquo;t need it at all.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia glanced at Osborne and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy it for myself. It&rsquo;s for The Wise Order. I made some mistakes before, and if I don&rsquo;t do anything, I&rsquo;ll probably be punished.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled. Ophelia wanted to buy a longevity herb to please The Wise Order of her family, huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, she was destined not to get what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because Osborne was determined to get this 300-year-old herb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To save Anastasia, he could do anything, and no matter who the competitor was, he would not give in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Seven million!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne raised his bidding paddle and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was surprised, and then she seemed to have thought of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She frowned. &ldquo;Osborne, you bought it to prolong your sister&rsquo;s life, right? Her illness doesn&rsquo;t need any further treatment, so why do you waste money? No matter how many longevity herbs she takes, she won&rsquo;t survive.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes turned cold, and he stared at Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You can speak ill of me and even scold me. But if you dare to swear at my sister again, I won&rsquo;t let you go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You can just try it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was stunned. Seeing the fury in Osborne&rsquo;s eyes, she felt her heart tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to say something but finally dared not speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley snorted coldly, &ldquo;Osborne, you bastard. You dare threaten Ophelia. Who do you think you are? You actually want to buy longevity herbs to prolong your sister&rsquo;s life. I won&rsquo;t let you get your wishes. Your sister will die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Wesley raised his bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Eight million!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
