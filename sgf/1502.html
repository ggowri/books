  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the Urban Development Exchange, a courteous attendant immediately approached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between Osborne and Fabian had unfolded at the far end of Blazing Avenue, and these onlookers had observed the fight from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hence, they treated Osborne with utmost respect, knowing he was a man who could withstand Fabian for twenty minutes without breaking a sweat&mdash;even if his method of survival was merely running away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Osborne's "lowly" human origin, the sheer fact that he could trade blows with a Deity Overlord warrior, openly curse such a formidable opponent, and live to tell the tale, made him untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most notably, Osborne had recently splurged a staggering 120 million in the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a high-rolling client demanded their finest service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, how may I assist you today? Are you looking to purchase a property? Please share your requirements, and I'll recommend the most suitable options for you," a beautiful woman said, winking at Osborne as if alluringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm in need of a property, preferably within the inner city. If it's in the core area, even better. It must be spacious, capable of housing at least 10 thousand, and provide ample privacy and security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these demands, the woman's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each requirement spelled big bucks, and a successful deal would earn her an enormous commission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energized, she continued, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, please wait a moment while I check for properties that meet your criteria. However, I must mention that as a human, the city decree restricts you to purchasing properties only in the outer or inner city. To buy in the core area, one must make significant contributions to Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city's prejudice against humans was evident, extending even to property purchases where wealth couldn't override core restrictions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Osborne wasn't overly concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then look within the inner city. Whether core or not isn't crucial, as long as it fits the bill."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Certainly, please wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman swiftly served coffee and began manipulating a terminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, her brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, I apologize, but there are no properties currently on sale in the inner city that meet your requirements. The largest estate available can only accommodate three thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps you'd consider waiting? Leave your contact, and I'll notify you promptly once something fitting comes up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. Just 3,000 capacities? Far from adequate for his current Spark of Blaze contingent of five thousand five hundred, with potential for growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And when might that be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman sighed. "That's unpredictable. Recent times have been calm around Wild Flame City. Such large properties might not surface for a long while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, too, lamented the missed opportunity for a hefty commission, but facts remained&mdash;no such estate was presently available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brows, thinking, "With so many people in Spark of Blaze, it's imperative they have a secure place to reside. Without proper accommodations, further progress is impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, why not consider a smaller estate? Three thousand capacity is ample, and we can all make do with less. After all, we were once slaves confined in cages&mdash;our expectations for comfort are minimal," Betty interjected softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, feeling the weight of the situation. "Is this really our only option?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the woman's terminal chimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly glanced down and then looked up with a surprised yet delighted expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, your luck is truly remarkable. A grand estate has just been listed for sale in our system, perfectly matching your requirements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face lit up at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do tell, more details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman eagerly nodded, saying, "This estate is exceptionally spacious, ranking among the top ten in Wild Flame City's inner district. It can easily accommodate even 50 thousand people if necessary, let alone 10 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Situated at the juncture of the inner city and core area, it backs onto a serene river that demarcates the core district. On either side, gentle hills ensure absolute tranquility and security&mdash;exactly as you requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the price? Quite reasonable!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
