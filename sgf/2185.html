  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attempting to take my life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even amidst this dire predicament, Isa maintained an astonishing composure. Her delicate visage showed not a trace of panic; instead, it was etched with an unwavering defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doomed to fail!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Isa unleashed a maelstrom of dark energy. Instantly, the skies above Celestara Planet grew ominously dark, as if an impending tempest was gathering. The surging energy congealed into a colossal black spear, hurtling towards Lord Malevolence with a deadly determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What a futile effort!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely unfazed, Lord Malevolence responded with a thunderous punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark spear shattered into fragments of energy, dissipating like a fading nightmare. He casually shook his hand, a confident smirk on his face. "A millennium ago... Nay, even a century ago, you might've given me a run for my money! You're the very image of the God of Night in his prime&mdash;your power and techniques are virtually indistinguishable!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately for you, I've long since left that level behind!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if your power rivals that of the God of Night at his peak, you're still no match for me. This war that's raged on for over a millennium will end right here and now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night won't be making an appearance!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His body is riddled with incurable wounds. Without a miracle, he won't be able to break through to a higher cultivation level again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most likely, he's skulking in the shadows, watching you all crumble one by one, too much of a coward to show his face. He knows that even if he did step forward, it would be in vain&mdash;he can't stop me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's petrified! He's abandoned you. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already slunk off to some far-flung corner, far from Celestara Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a derisive laugh, Lord Malevolence suddenly lunged at Isa. In the blink of an eye, he was right before her, his hand closing tightly around her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked gasps rippled through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and the others went deathly pale. Their hearts pounded in their chests as they watched Lord Malevolence tighten his grip. It seemed as if the next second could be Isa's last, and panic welled up within them like a wildfire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Isa remained unfazed; she even smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence furrowed his brow, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've already defeated her, and have her in my grasp, so why is she still smiling?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That unsettling thought crept into his mind. He scanned the surroundings carefully, not sensing any threat, and allowed himself to relax slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little girl, what's so funny?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa met his gaze with calm defiance. "I'm laughing at how long you've been the God of Night's adversary, yet you still don't understand him! How could he possibly be afraid? How could he abandon us and run away?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, her disdain evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wanted to escape, he would've done so a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wanted to flee, he could have done it a hundred years ago! You don't know him at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa flashed a tranquil smile and added, "He's returning! I can sense it deep within... he's making his way back!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's visage clouded over instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A volatile blend of seething rage and sheer desperation coursed through him, compelling his hand to clench ever-tighter around Isa's throat. Nevertheless, Isa remained the picture of composure. Her features were as steady as a rock, radiating an air of quiet pride and an unwavering resolve that nothing could break.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence scoffed with blatant disdain, saying, "Even if he does return, it's all in vain. Do you truly believe he stands a chance against me? The injuries festering within him are beyond redemption. His cultivation level has hit a dead-end at Ascension Nine and will never progress. He's nothing but a spent force now. There's not a thing he can do to stop me from resurrecting the Malevolence Empire on Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even if he returns, he'll just have to watch as I wipe you all out, slaughter the local Human Community, and then... I'll finish him off!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help but chuckle, shaking her head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's expression darkened. "What's so funny now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied, "I'm laughing at how naive you are! None of your imagined outcomes will come to pass! You won't kill us, and you won't have a chance to rebuild your Malevolence Empire, let alone kill him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, you should be grateful that the God of Night has those wounds; otherwise, you wouldn't even be worthy to face him! If he weren't injured, you would have been dead the moment you set foot on Celestara Planet a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now... I can feel him coming back!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your good times are about to end!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa spoke, her smile grew broader and broader, a stark contrast to Lord Malevolence, whose face darkened with each passing moment, a storm of anger brewing beneath his skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night is coming back, you say? Well, where is he? I don't see hide nor hair of him!" Lord Malevolence sneered, his voice dripping with disbelief and mockery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll lay your eyes on him soon enough," Isa replied calmly, her tone unshaken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're just trying to buy time! I've had enough of this nonsense. It's time to put an end to this farce!" Lord Malevolence roared, his patience completely worn thin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he raised his hand high in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power, dark and menacing, began to gather around him like a swarm of ravenous demons. A chilling aura of death oozed from his very being, sending shivers down everyone's spines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the reaper itself had descended upon them, and it was clear that he was moments away from unleashing his full-blown wrath on Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa just kept smiling, as if she knew something that no one else did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa!" Clarissa and the others gasped, their faces draining of all color.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over them like a tsunami as they saw Lord Malevolence about to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We can't just stand by and let him kill Isa!" one of them cried out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" another shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the colossal Sanctum of Night rumbled to life. It lunged forward with a thunderous roar, unleashing a tidal wave of terrifying energy straight at Lord Malevolence, like a vengeful beast awakening from its slumber.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" Lord Malevolence let out a sneering scoff, his contempt as palpable as the stench of decay. "Can't contain yourselves any longer, can you? Well, fret not. Once I've dealt with this puny girl, you'll be next in line for a world of pain!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nonchalant flick of his finger, as if he were merely shooing away a pesky fly, the colossal Malevolence Tower roared to life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It loomed large, positioning itself like an immovable fortress to intercept the oncoming assault from the Sanctum of Night. In an instant, it formed an impenetrable barrier, cutting off Clarissa and the others from reaching Isa, like a wall of steel separating prey from salvation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Apex divine artifacts clashed with a cataclysmic force, a titanic collision that sent shockwaves rippling through the very air. The impact was so powerful that it felt like the very fabric of reality was being torn apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and Austin exchanged hasty, panicked glances. Fear and determination were etched deep into their faces, like battle scars on a warrior's visage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't count on the Sanctum of Night any longer!" Clarissa hissed, her voice laced with urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to take matters into our own hands!" Emma added, her eyes ablaze with a fierce resolve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, the three women burst out of the Sanctum of Night like arrows released from a bow. They sprinted towards Lord Malevolence, their hearts pounding with a desperate, primal urge to save Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a maniacal laugh that echoed through the battlefield, a laugh that seemed to mock their futile attempt at heroism.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Maddox materialized out of thin air, blocking their path. His eyes were like shards of ice, piercing and cold, fixed intently on Clarissa and her companions. A palpable aura of murderlust oozed from him, as if he were a ravenous wolf eyeing its helpless prey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can rescue the Night Witch? How utterly naive! You'd be better off focusing on saving your own skins.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because today, you're all going to meet your maker!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those chilling words, Maddox launched his attack. As an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, he was a force to be reckoned with. He still seethed with humiliation from his previous encounter with Isa, and now, he was hell-bent on unleashing all his pent-up frustration.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he overpowered Clarissa and her companions, like a raging storm overwhelming a frail boat at sea. They were quickly ensnared in a brutal struggle, their every move countered by his overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lord Malevolence's hand, crackling with a terrifying, otherworldly power, descended slowly towards Isa's head, like the guillotine blade inching closer to its victim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little girl, there's no escape now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even the God of Night can save you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your time has come," Lord Malevolence hissed, a cruel smile on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lord Malevolence's hand descended ever closer, it was as if an inescapable shadow of doom enveloped Isa. It seemed like a foregone conclusion that her head would be crushed like a ripe watermelon, marking the end of her life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid this impending catastrophe, Isa remained serene, a gentle smile still gracing her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered in a soft, almost inaudible voice, "I can sense his return."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of anticipation and trust in her tone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
