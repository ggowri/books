  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The trial on the fourteenth floor was even harder for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Out of a hundred warriors' projections, only fifty reached mid Empyrean Sacredness. No wonder Seraphina and the others took about a hundred breaths to finish the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was still effortless for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No warriors' projections could withstand his attacks; they were all instantly killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Clara, Leroy, and Casey didn&rsquo;t need to make a move at all. Osborne swiftly ended the battle and claimed the highest reward again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was one hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With this, earning battle points isn't that hard. We've already got 230 million battle points just by clearing the fourteenth level. Once we clear the eighteenth level, the battle points we earn will definitely be enough to exchange for the Perfect Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rewards he gained after successfully clearing the Celestial Spire were immense, far better than what he got from participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel lasted an entire year. Starting from the Sect Tournament, Osborne went through the city duel, state duel, zone duel, and finally the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. He faced many difficulties and challenges, but in the end, he only earned over 50 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 50 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints is equivalent to more than 500 million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they have gained over 200 million battle points in just one day after entering the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they spent most of the first day breaking through their cultivation level, which took a lot of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their actual time spent clearing stages was less than a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they will surely earn more battle points and exchange for many treasures that cannot be obtained with Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne feels that earning battle points here is too easy for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, only he can say such things because his strength is strong enough. If it were someone else, not only would they fail to get the highest rewards on every stage, but just reaching the fourteenth level without being eliminated would already be impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, after Seraphina teamed up with so many people, they have only managed to get one-tenth of the highest reward so far. Perhaps soon, they will only be able to get the lowest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They might even gradually get eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is already the trump card prepared by Frederick. To help Seraphina improve her strength, Frederick tried every possible method.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Seraphina still feels it&rsquo;s very difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne still feels completely at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's keep going!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne began to feel excited. "Maybe I really have a chance to earn enough battle points to buy the Imperial Artifact! As long as I'm strong enough, the Celestial Spire is the greatest opportunity in Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other three entered the fifteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and her teammates were wandering through the mist on the fifteenth floor, searching for the trial location. She had lost her sense of direction and could only rely on luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, as long as they were willing to spend time, they would eventually find it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t plan to follow them anymore. He was already familiar with the Celestial Spire, so he no longer needed to stick with Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne felt they were too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne planned to get ahead of Seraphina and the others. Although the effect of Satan's Eye would be suppressed in the mist of the Celestial Spire, he was confident he could find the trial area faster than Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly led Clara, Leroy, and Casey around Seraphina's team. He scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye and searched at an incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, Osborne found the trial area on the fifteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up! Don't let them know we've gotten ahead of them," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all nodded and responded, "Don't worry. They definitely won't be that fast. It'll take them a long time to find this place, and they might even think we couldn't pass the trial on the fourteenth floor..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the trial on the fourteenth floor requires fifty mid Empyrean Sacredness level individuals, but there are only four of us. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes, we wouldn't believe you could take them down so quickly on your own," Clara said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Casey nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were also in Seraphina's team, they might think Osborne couldn't pass the trial on the fourteenth floor either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in reality, not to mention the fourteenth floor, even the trial on the fifteenth floor was effortless for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All one hundred warriors' projections had reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such strength is enough to stop anyone who has just broken through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Seraphina, even a team of dozens would struggle to pass.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely drew the Bloodwrought Bow. After he released one arrow, all one hundred warriors' projections shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took no more than one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the four of them naturally received the highest reward again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each received another hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four of them already had over three hundred million battle points each, more than enough to exchange for several high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is far from over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly led Clara, Leroy, and Casey away from the fifteenth floor and reached the sixteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Satan's Eye, finding the trial area wasn't difficult for them; it only took a few minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the four of them entered the trial area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were still a hundred warriors' projections here. The difference was that the power fluctuations from ten of them had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are ten warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are also ninety warriors who have broken through to mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy even took a deep breath, looking worriedly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just smiled, completely unconcerned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the Battle Points Monument. When he noticed the highest reward on the Battle Points Monument had increased again, his eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The minimum reward is ten million battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The highest reward has reached one billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In other words, if we can finish the fight within ten breaths, we can get the highest reward. The battle points we earn on this level alone would be enough to exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir or ten Supreme Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must get the highest reward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among the hundred warriors' projections, ten have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, which is no problem for Osborne at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, his cultivation level has also surpassed advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, there is still a gap between them. Osborne has reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, but even when facing ordinary warriors who have achieved Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he is confident in defeating them with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can even fight warriors who have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The warriors' projections who reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness here can at best be considered ordinary talents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if Osborne hadn't surpassed Empyrean Sacredness, he would still be confident in dealing with them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As the Sacred Power Arrow on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow shimmered, it split into hundreds of Sacred Power Arrows the moment it shot out, swiftly locking onto a hundred warriors' projections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the violent explosion, all the warriors' projections shattered and vanished. Osborne and the other three cleared the stage again, effortlessly earning the highest reward."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They each received another billion battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were completely stunned."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They looked at each other, speechless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can Osborne even instantly kill warriors who have reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How strong is Osborne really? Is this the power he gained after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They felt the gap in strength between them and Osborne had grown even wider."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not long after, the four arrived at the trial area of the seventeenth level. This time, among the hundred warriors' projections, fifty had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Osborne still killed them all with a single arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They also successfully passed the seventeenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but become excited, as they had finally reached the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the eighteenth level, there is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><div class="pagination">
