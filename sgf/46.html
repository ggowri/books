  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were thrilled to receive Donna&rsquo;s praise, feeling a surge of joy in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne simply shrugged, too indifferent to bother arguing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furrowing her brow, Donna questioned, &ldquo;I just asked you not to see Clarissa. Why are you so adamant in refusing? Do you truly believe you have a chance?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s irrelevant.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Irrelevant? Do you think I&rsquo;ll believe you? And I&rsquo;m curious, why can&rsquo;t you be more flexible and pretend to agree, reaping benefits before reneging on your promise?&rdquo; Donna pressed on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;For me, keeping a promise is a fundamental principle. If I promise not to see Ms. Radcliffe, then I won&rsquo;t, because that&rsquo;s a commitment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s disbelief was evident. &ldquo;Is that so?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;In this society, are there still people who value promises so highly? You think sweet talk will earn my favor?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;Believe it or not, that&rsquo;s up to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Donna could continue, a bodyguard approached and whispered something in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression shifted to one of surprise as she looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, I somewhat believe what you said. It seems you and those two are not allies, perhaps even enemies. You took their money and could have left them out of the banquet, but you chose to bring them along.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly and shrugged, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unavoidable. If I promised to bring them when I took their money, even if I dislike them, I have to follow through.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nodded, her gaze towards Osborne less icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Regardless, the fact remains that you once saved Clarissa. You may not want the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s rewards, but we cannot ignore a debt of gratitude.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of thought, she continued, &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll back down. I won&rsquo;t ask you to avoid Clarissa, but do you have any requests? As long as they&rsquo;re not too unreasonable, I can agree.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At these words, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia, once again consumed by jealousy, speculated on what Osborne might ask for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at them with a slight smile, Osborne quipped, &ldquo;I request that the Radcliffe family help me take down those two great families. Can you manage that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia&rsquo;s faces paled in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, what nonsense are you talking?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you can&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They both exclaimed, worriedly looking at Donna, fearing her agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna, looking perplexed, replied, &ldquo;No! But if you agree not to see Clarissa in the future, I can help you suppress them. However, the Radcliffe family won&rsquo;t go as far as completely destroying them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pretended to consider this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were horrified at the thought of their families being targeted by the Radcliffe family, which could potentially lead to bankruptcy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them wore ashen expressions, staring at Osborne in horror, in fear that he might agree to what was being proposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing their reaction, Osborne chuckled in satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, forget it. I won&rsquo;t trouble the Radcliffe family with taking down those two great families. I&rsquo;ll handle it myself from now on.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna shook her head. &ldquo;Young man, you may have the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s support, but aiming to dismantle two great families will be quite the challenge.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is that so? There&rsquo;s no harm in trying.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled, paying no heed to the darkening faces of Ophelia and Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not wanting to waste any more time, Donna urged, &ldquo;State your request, preferably something practical.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded, finally revealing his intention. &ldquo;I wish to stay at Radcliffe Manor. I want to become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard, ensuring her safety.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne&rsquo;s unexpected request to stay at Radcliffe Manor as Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one had anticipated that Osborne would forgo the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s support and 100 million in cash, opting instead to become Clarissa&rsquo;s personal protector.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But soon enough, their thoughts caught up with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia were both filled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">This jerk really has his eyes on Ms. Radcliffe. Giving up the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s backing to stay as her bodyguard must be his way of getting close to her, pursuing her, and winning her heart</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This jerk doesn&rsquo;t just want to avoid the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s support; he wants to be Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s husband</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Damn it!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia felt a pang of jealousy in her heart, thinking that Osborne had just been asked for a divorce by her, and now he was already thinking about pursuing Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was completely out of her league.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression darkened as well. She also suspected that Osborne&rsquo;s desire to remain as a bodyguard was all about getting close to Clarissa and winning her over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, after a brief moment of consideration, she did not reject his request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna said sternly, &ldquo;I can agree to this, but being Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard is not a role for just anyone. You&rsquo;ll need to prove to me that you have the necessary skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As fate would have it, there will be a bodyguard recruitment assessment later. You can join in, and if you manage to stand out, I will allow you to stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you fail, then you&rsquo;ll have to leave without making any more demands.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
