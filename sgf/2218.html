  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside the mountain, a chaotic spectacle greeted Osborne and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All manner of creatures were crammed into the space, a dense mass of beings shackled by metal chains pulsating with divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them looked utterly wretched, like livestock penned up, awaiting their turn to be sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer quantity was mind-boggling&mdash;millions upon millions of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used his Satan's Eye to scan the crowd. It showed that the weakest among them were at least at the Celestial Deity Level. Most were Deity Overlords, and there were even some Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also spotted a few Supernal Deity Kings in the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really hit him hard was the talent of these beings. Nearly half of them were from the Human Community. Their eyes were lifeless, filled with despair, and they shuffled around like empty shells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no question about it&mdash;these were slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All these millions of beings were being trafficked to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. The scale of this operation was massive. Gathering such a large number of beings, each at least a Celestial Deity, would have required the life-force of a small life planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phantom Tide Demon Sect warriors patrolled the area. They mercilessly lashed out at any slaves who dared to resist, leaving them bloodied and howling in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with a foul stench, a stark reminder of the suffering going on within these walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face clouded over as he witnessed the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He balled his fists tightly, and memories of his own parents came flooding back. Over twenty years ago, they had been sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, enduring the same fate of beatings and humiliation at the hands of these very warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!" Osborne growled under his breath, his anger reaching a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he managed to rein in his impulse to attack right away, figuring it was wiser to size up the situation first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What on earth does the Phantom Tide Demon Sect want with so many slaves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are they going to use them for mining?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or resell them for a profit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or is there something even more evil going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, casting a glance at Vince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Vince stepped off the battleship and casually gave orders to his men. "Keep a close watch on those women on the ship. Don't let them out of their rooms! If anyone dares to step out, kill them on the spot! We can't let a single soul find out what's going on here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" the warriors responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince then climbed onto a platform and surveyed the sea of slaves with a smug grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, not bad at all! The quality of this batch is top-notch! Once we sell them, we'll make a fortune in resources and Celestial Crystals! The bigwigs on Racial Convergence Planet are going to be over the moon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to one of the warriors from the Phantom Tide Demon Sect. "Have we accounted for all the slaves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Vince Brunson! The last batch has arrived! We're all set to ship them out. The buyers have already paid the deposit. Once we deliver the goods, they'll pay the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince nodded with a smile. "Perfect! Let's get this party started! Move it! We can't keep our buyers twiddling their thumbs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, pandemonium broke loose. The warriors roughly herded millions of slaves into metal containers, jamming thousands into each one. The slaves were packed like sardines, hardly able to move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal boxes were then hauled to the middle of a huge clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set sail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set sail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a soft hum, a hexagram formation materialized in the clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It glowed brighter and brighter, engulfing the metal boxes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a Spatial Translocator!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank.</span><br><span>So the Phantom Tide Demon Sect isn't keeping these slaves for themselves. They're shipping them off somewhere else. This just made things a whole lot more complicated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if my parents were sold to the Phantom Tide Demon Sect over twenty years ago, finding them now is like looking for a needle in a haystack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the harsh reality dawned on him, his spirits plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice cut through the tense atmosphere, laced with urgency. "Osborne, should we make our move now? If we don't act fast, those slaves will be teleported away! And their fate..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and said, "Let's do it! Even though these slaves aren't our problem, we can't just stand by and watch now that we've found them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he fixed his eyes on Vince, then turned to the imposing figure in heavy armor standing behind Vince.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King&mdash;the most powerful being in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used his Satan's Eye to see through the armor and recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Shelvin, one of the seven core leaders of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, you deal with Vince! I'll take on Shelvin! We need to strike like lightning&mdash;don't give them a chance to send out an alarm!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "Roger that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's rock and roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne and Isa sprang into action. Just as the Spatial Translocator was about to kick into gear, Osborne materialized out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed a finger at the device, and poof! The Translocator ground to a sudden halt, and the glowing hexagram formation vanished in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince's excitement fizzled into confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, rooted to the spot, totally bewildered about what had just gone down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin was a lot quicker on the uptake. He roared, "Damn it! Mr. Vince Brunson, look out! We've got trouble! Someone's trying to mess with us! Contact Mr. Brunson right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he locked eyes with Osborne, his gaze blazing with homicidal rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him out!" he bellowed and lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed. "You're just at Ascension Nine level, and you think you can take me down? You're in for a rude awakening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne unleashed a thunderous palm strike at Shelvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power raged as his hand connected with Shelvin, shattering the divine power defense in the blink of an eye. However, the thick armor Shelvin was wearing absorbed the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what the hell?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack, though not at full throttle, was no joke&mdash;no run-of-the-mill Ascension Nine warrior could take it. After all, he'd just reached Ascension Seven, way stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when he was Ascension Four, he'd taken down an Ascension Ten warrior like Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking out an Ascension Nine should've been a piece of cake, but here he was, shocked that Shelvin had weathered his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared daggers at Shelvin's armor, his eyes icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That armor's got some serious defense! But you know what? It won't be your savior! Unless that armor's a Sacred Artifact, you're toast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, a massive wave of Sacred Power coursed through him, forming a gigantic hand that came crashing down on Shelvin like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shelvin's eyes popped out in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening explosion shook the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strike sent Shelvin flying through the air. His armor shattered into a million pieces under the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from Shelvin's mouth as he hit the ground and lay there, unable to move a muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the other side of the battlefield, Isa had also jumped into the fray. Enveloped in darkness, she darted towards Vince at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the darkness exploded all around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, didn't stand a ghost of a chance against her. Isa had all the strength of Osborne's past life and could go toe-to-toe with Ascension Ten foes like Lord Malevolence for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have a prayer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince was thrown back, blood pouring from his lips as he crumpled to the ground, unconscious.</span></p><div class="pagination">
