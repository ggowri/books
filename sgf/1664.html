  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Angelo and his companions were engaged in a fierce battle, Osborne, with Diana in tow, quietly made his way to another part of the top platform of Celestial Sword Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he had a clear view of the entire scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Angelo, who relied on their physical senses, Osborne possessed Satan's Eye, allowing him to instantly take in the entire scope of the platform. The area was vast, covering a diameter of six miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Angelo and his group were locked in combat on the western edge, but the number of Deathborn present far exceeded their expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least five thousand of them, and the weakest among them were at the Celestial Deity level. The number of Deity Overlord-level Deathborn likely exceeded five hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo's in trouble," Osborne muttered, though he showed no intention of intervening. His attention was immediately drawn toward the center of the platform, where a peculiar large stone stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone was unlike anything he had seen before. It glowed faintly with an ethereal light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its shape was that of a human sitting cross-legged, complete with a head, torso, and limbs, yet it lacked any facial features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing on this humanoid stone were three luminous plants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One sprouted from the top, another from the abdomen, and the third from the outstretched palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart quickened as he recognized these rare floras as Miracle Elixirs, legendary for their potent healing and rejuvenating properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened. He had heard countless legends about these legendary plants but had never seen one in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a glimpse was enough to ignite a burning desire within him to possess them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't rush into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding the Miracle Elixirs were numerous Deathborns, who paid no attention to the battle on the western side and instead remained kneeling before the humanoid stone with a demeanor of utmost reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were filled with devotion, and from their presence, Osborne sensed an overwhelming aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of them are at t</span><span>he peak of Deity Overlord level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty-nine in total!" Osborne muttered, his expression growing solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These forty-nine Deity Overlord-level Deathborns surrounded the humanoid stone, guarding the Miracle Elixirs fiercely. To obtain them, Osborne would first need to deal with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current strength, taking on one or two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns wouldn't be difficult, but more than that would require considerable effort and time&mdash;not something he could handle swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And forty-nine of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was beyond his current capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They aren't moving, so I can't sneak in and take the Miracle Elixirs. I'll have to wait. The other Deathborns will struggle to hold off Angelo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they're overwhelmed, these peak-level Deathborns will have to step in to reinforce. That's when I'll make my move," Osborne thought, his patience kicking in as he fixed his gaze on the Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One emits red light, another white, and the last blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared his confusion with Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, unable to see the Miracle Elixirs herself, listened with wide eyes, her face a mix of shock and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are three of them?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "They look rather ordinary, just like common plants, but their glows are different. Do you recognize them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head. "I don't recognize it! And no one can truly recognize it, because the form of the Miracle Elixir isn't important. What matters is the light it emits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Miracle Elixir, also known as the Five-Color Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to research, the different colors surrounding the Miracle Elixir represent different medicinal effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So far, five colors of the Miracle Elixir have been discovered. They are red, yellow, blue, white, and black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless of its color, the basic effect of any Miracle Elixir is to enhance potential and talent. The red Miracle Elixir, in particular, focuses on boosting one's cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's said that using the red Miracle Elixir can directly break through a major realm! Even a peak Deity Overlord, after consuming the red Miracle Elixir, stands a significant chance of breaking through to the Quasi-Deity King level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quasi-Deity King?" Osborne murmured, a bit puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly explained, "You should know that to become a Deity King, there are three criteria! First, one must break through to the peak Deity Overlord realm. Second, the Divine Body must reach at least Level Seven! Third, elemental essence must also reach Level Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only when all three conditions are met can one be considered a true Deity King! If only one or two of these conditions are met, they are only considered a Quasi-Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Quasi-Deity King is stronger than a peak Deity Overlord but weaker than a true Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The red Miracle Elixir can directly boost one's cultivation level, but it has no effect on the Divine Body or elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The yellow Miracle Elixir enhances the Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blue Miracle Elixir boosts elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The white Miracle Elixir can heal all wounds and, to some extent, even bring the dead back to life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the black Miracle Elixir... it's said to enhance the soul and insight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
