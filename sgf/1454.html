  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian looked at Osborne with a face full of scorn. "Lachlan, stop pretending! You think you can bluff your way into being a big client and threaten us with complaints? Do you really think you qualify as a big client? Every time you came here to buy slaves, you haggled for ages and only picked the worst ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If someone like you could ever be a big client, our slave market would have gone under ages ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember you couldn't even afford a decent carriage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lillian finished her taunt, Yannick, the member of the Rainbow Viper Clan beside her, chuckled, clearly relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Lachlan, are you going to apologize or what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to make a move against you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick took a step toward Osborne, his eyes filled with menace. As a Transcendent Deity warrior, he was at a similar level as Lachlan, and while he wasn't entirely sure he could take Osborne in a fight, he felt confident in his territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was the slave market, his domain, and Yannick doubted that a lowly member of the Human Community would dare to stir up trouble here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he had a dozen backup enforcers behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a threatening glare, he continued, "If you don't apologize to Lillian and get out of here, I won't hesitate to make my move. You'll have to deal with the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes at Yannick's words. "Go ahead, give it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been Lachlan standing there, he would have likely caved under the pressure, maybe even offered up some Essence Crystals to appease Yannick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Swift family, while powerful in Wild Flame City, couldn't compare to the Rainbow Viper Clan, let alone the true masters of the slave market&mdash;the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were </span><span>forces</span><span> the Swift family couldn't hope to challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as a member of the core leadership of the Swift family, Lachlan had no choice but to submit under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But standing there was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the get-go, he had resolved not to let anyone humiliate him. Osborne wasn't there to be disrespected. No matter who it was, if they tried to bully him, he'd fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it came down to it, he could always start fresh with a new identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he possessed the Level Six peak space elemental essence, and if he wanted to escape, even a Deity Overlord warrior wouldn't be able to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, how could Osborne possibly back down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "You want me to apologize?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You think you can hit me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were cold, filled with defiance and even a hint of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How can Lachlan be so bold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's just a Human Community member!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never seen anyone from the younger generation here in Wild Flame City stand up to a warrior from another race like this, let alone provoke them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Lachlan lost his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Yannick, who wore an expression of fluctuating anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yannick had never encountered a Human Community member who dared to speak to him this way, and it infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span> pathetic human scum, you've really crossed the line! Since you want to play tough, I'll personally make you pay. I'll break your bones and make you submit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Yannick lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his formidable divine power in a single, powerful punch aimed straight at Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Yannick's massive form was sent flying backward, his chest caving in as he crashed to the ground, blood spilling from his mouth in a violent torrent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming hush enveloped the scene, leaving everyone in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian stared at Osborne in shock, slowly retracting her foot and swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan actually dared to make a move!" she thought, incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had "Lachlan" struck first, but he had also kicked Yannick, sending Yannick flying with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One kick, and he had severely injured Yannick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "The guy is a Transcendent Deity warrior, for crying out loud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Yannick's entourage finally snapped to attention, their faces twisted in anger as they glared at Osborne. In unison, they charged at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble by causing a scene in the slave market!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize right now! Go get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen warriors surged forward, a mix of Transcendent Deities and Superior Deities, their various attacks converging on Osborne like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Osborne burst through the onslaught, completely unscathed, not even a wrinkle in his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed coldly, and then it was his turn to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams erupted as chaos ensued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian could barely keep up with the whirlwind of movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, Osborne had plunged into the crowd, moving like a tiger among terrified rabbits. Within just a few breaths, everyone around him was down on the ground, writhing in pain and crying out in anguish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There</span><span> stood Osborne, untouched, his expression as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne turned his gaze to her, a mocking smile appearing on his face. "Is this what you think gives you the upper hand? Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, he was suddenly in front of her, gripping her neck tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
