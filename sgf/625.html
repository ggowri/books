  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was hidden within the twisted light, finally completing his Vampire Transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the transformation complete, he breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the pain throughout his body and let out a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a close call. He had nearly been defeated here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being taken down by his own subordinates was too tragic to contemplate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had underestimated the strength of this group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power might not be formidable&mdash;perhaps the strongest among them were only on par with Sam or, at most, slightly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the combined force they wielded was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, the current Osborne was no match for their united might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this through, he felt both joy and discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pleased that these individuals were strong and would be great allies in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was also distressed that he had almost been killed by them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the instructors and students being suppressed by his Vampire Transformation yet still gritting their teeth and trying to attack, Osborne finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop. I am not the enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the twisted light returned to normal, Osborne appeared in everyone's line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Osborne Augustine. You should know of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne spoke, there was an initial silence, followed by looks of astonishment on everyone's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Osborne? You are our boss Mr. Augustine?" one of the instructors asked in amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, liking the sound of the title. Godfather had said that he could trust this group implicitly. They would be utterly loyal to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded. "Yes, I am Osborne, your boss. I intended to test your strength but almost left my life here. I am very satisfied with your abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Osborne's words, the group exchanged glances, and then all showed expressions of relief mixed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, we apologize, we did not know it was you. Your Vampire Transformation was too bizarre, and the threat to us too great. We were concerned it was an enemy, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand. "Never mind, it's all in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who among you is in charge?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged instructor quickly stepped forward and bowed respectfully. "Mr. Augustine, I am No. 1. I am in charge of the training base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. 1? Don't you have a name?" Osborne asked with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 shook his head and said, "Mr. Augustine, we were all abandoned orphans, suffering from terminal illnesses since childhood. If it weren't for Godfather taking us in and curing our diseases, we would have been dead already. So, when we joined Training Base No. 6, we had already abandoned our old names and only have codes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised and looked at the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your codes then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I am No. 2!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I am No. 3!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone quickly reported their codes. The twenty instructors were essentially numbered according to their strength, and the smaller the number, the stronger the individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five hundred students were divided into five combat squads, each consisting of a hundred members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of Squad One had codes ranging from 100 to 199, Squad Two from 200 to 299, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member with an integer code had reached Class A strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the others were in Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few members were still at Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne understood the situation of Training Base No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a question in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. 1, why are there so many </span><span>Class</span><span> A- metahumans in Training Base No. 6? Also, why can all of you transform into Vampires?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that advancing to Class A was difficult and dangerous. Under normal circumstances, only one out of a hundred attempting to reach Class A would succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety would fail and die directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining nine, who neither succeeded nor perished, would become Class A- metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Training Base No. 6, there were more than four hundred Class A- students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's question, No. 1 replied immediately, "Mr. Augustine, the Draco Group has a potion. After taking it, even if one fails to reach Class A, it ensures they won't die and will become Class A-."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was somewhat astonished at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Draco Group actually has such a potion? It can ensure that those striving for Class A won't die even if they fail. Really amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 continued, "As for why we can all transform into Vampires, it's also arranged by Godfather. We were all injected with the Vampire potion from the Draco Group, which gave us the power to transform into Vampires."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, No. 1 looked hesitant, as if he wanted to say something but dared not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne encouraged, "No. 1, speak your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 nodded gravely. "Mr. Augustine, we are all very curious about why your transformation into a Vampire can exert such a powerful suppression over us, making us genuinely feel fear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered this as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Perhaps my transformation is more complete, more advanced than yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 shook his head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible, Mr. Augustine! Even if your transformation is more complete and more advanced, it shouldn't exert such a terrifying pressure and fear over us, unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of uncertainty appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Unless what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 said earnestly, "Unless you are the progenitor of the Vampires! Only the progenitor of the Vampires could possibly exert such a terrifying pressure over those who have transformed into Vampires, making us feel genuine fear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I the progenitor of the Vampires?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
