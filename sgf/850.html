  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock at the slightly bent Rock Smasher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no ordinary artifact; it was a Premium divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To bend it with a single kick was something only a Class S could achieve. It meant Osborne's right leg's attack power had now reached that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face Marvin now, he wouldn't be caught off guard; in fact, with a chance to land a solid kick, victory seemed within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the added power of Explosive Force, taking down a Class S like Marvin wouldn't be out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleased with the results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle to save Kendra and Yulissa, while incredibly dangerous, had been worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His right leg had evolved into a Divine Bone, and his entire body had absorbed a massive amount of blood energy, making him even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had surged far beyond its previous limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, using the Breath of Celestial to compress the Dark Deity's blood energy had not only enhanced his abilities but had also upgraded his Breath of Celestial to the fifth tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the fourth tier could boost his power by 80%, the fifth tier provided a twofold increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength cap had been raised once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without mastering Explosive Force, Osborne was now confident in challenging an ordinary Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about hitting the jackpot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne marveled at the transformation, feeling the power surge through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross had gained significantly as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's enormous blood energy had been split evenly; half had been absorbed by Osborne and the other half by the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Blood Cross was finally showing its divine artifact capabilities, becoming incredibly agile and vibrating gently within Osborne's heart, radiating a subtle power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transforming into a Vampire will triple, if not more, my strength, speed, and reflexes! Even against Cuthbert, I can defeat him without transforming. If I do transform, one strike should be enough to take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied with his progress, Osborne gathered Kendra and Yulissa and made his way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before he encountered the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star asked, astonished, "Osborne, you really did it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's face was a picture of surprise. Clearly, Osborne had had to defeat the Dark Deity to rescue Kendra and Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I'm glad I didn't disappoint you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was visibly excited. "Excellent! Truly excellent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's finally dead! I spent all my strength to imprison her in this tomb, turning myself into this half-dead, barely-existent being without flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that she's gone, I'm free at last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, the God of Star fixed his gaze on Osborne and said earnestly, "Osborne, as I promised, when you returned alive, I'd teach you how to harness Light Power and even enhance your Light Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come, let's begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart leaped with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star, being a genuine deity capable of imprisoning the Dark Deity for so long, was certainly on the same level of power. With his guidance, Osborne's Light Power would undoubtedly see tremendous growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly seated himself, eyes filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star scrutinized him, seemingly seeing through to his light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of reminiscence crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he spoke, "Osborne, your light elemental essence is indeed powerful. At least, it's very potent for you right now. Yet, you haven't fully tapped into its potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be precise, your light elemental essence has been sealed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock. "Sealed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. It was sealed because it was too powerful for you. Without sealing it, your body would have never been able to merge with it. But now, with your body having grown stronger, we can unseal a part of it. I'll do that for you right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding light surged into Osborne's body. He could clearly feel his light elemental essence beginning to shift, a more powerful force erupting from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Osborne's Light Realm erupted on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming Light Realm instantly enveloped the entire dungeon, and Osborne's face showed astonishment as he sensed the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what's happening? My Light Realm is getting stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star smiled, "Indeed! With the unsealing of your light elemental essence, your Light Realm has upgraded. It's moved from a level three Realm to a level four Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A level four Realm is more than sufficient for you now. After all, most Class S Lesser Gods spend their entire lives without mastering a level four Realm."</span></p><div class="pagination">
