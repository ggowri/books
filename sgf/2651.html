  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, everyone from the major powers chose to submit in order to survive&mdash;everyone except Adriana and May from the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone stood behind Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their identities shifted rapidly; moments ago, they were in fear and struggle, but now they looked at Adriana and the others with cold, mocking eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if their choice signified a consensus, since they chose to submit, Adriana's defiance seemed out of place, even utterly foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Casey, get over here now!" someone shouted at Casey, their tone extremely harsh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Casey's face was filled with struggle and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one yelling at her was the leader of her sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching him choose to submit to Frederick, Casey's eyes were filled with disappointment. At first, she hesitated in response to his call, but soon she firmly stood her ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Sorry, Master! I will not submit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick wants us to submit to him, to become his slaves. I may not be strong, but I have my dignity. I would rather die than bow to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, please rest assured, I won't bring trouble to the sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, I declare my departure from the sect. I have no further ties with you. Everything I do represents only myself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Casey's expression grew even more resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, the person became extremely angry but said helplessly, "If you seek death, no one can save you. Since that's the case, you are no longer part of our sect from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he coldly stared at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled slightly at this moment and said to Casey, "Since you have left your previous sect, why not join Fairy Moon Sect? I can promise you, even if I die, even if Fairy Moon Sect is destroyed, we will never surrender to Frederick, never become slaves of the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you willing to join Fairy Moon Sect?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey hesitated briefly, then nodded, "Thank you, Ms. Alba. I&rsquo;m willing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded with satisfaction. "Good! From now on, you are part of Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey reached Empyrean Sacredness and naturally qualified to be part of Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Adriana turned to Clara and Leroy, "What about you two? Are you willing to join Fairy Moon Sect? If you join, I will do my utmost to protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance and finally looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could speak, Adriana smiled and said, "You don't need to look at him. In fact, Osborne has long been a member of Fairy Moon Sect, and his position in the sect is second only to me and the two deputy leaders."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't believe me, you can ask him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Clara and Leroy looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they said in unison, "Thank you for your invitation, Ms. Alba. We are willing to join Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great! From now on, you are also members of Fairy Moon Sect!" Adriana said happily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was Casey, Clara, or Leroy, their talents were all top-notch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Frederick snorted coldly and said icily, "Adriana, you're on the verge of death, and Fairy Moon Sect is about to be destroyed, yet you still have the mind to recruit new members here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked disdainful. "Don't you find this ridiculous? Or do you think just the two of you can stand against us? Can protect these useless ones?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Frederick finished speaking, the Royal Family members behind him, along with those who had just pledged allegiance to him, burst into mocking laughter filled with ridicule.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, I think you've lost your mind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you refuse to submit, only death awaits you! Fairy Moon Sect is destined to perish! What&rsquo;s the point of recruiting new members now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are doomed to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Adriana's expression turned cold as she said indifferently, "You people are not worthy to speak to me like this. In the past, I might have respected you and regarded you as equals. But now, since you willingly submit to Frederick, shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are not worthy to speak to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's gaze fixed on Frederick as she sneered coldly, "Frederick, do you really think you can kill us? Do you really think you can trap us here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick frowned, looking at the confident and composed Adriana, feeling a faint sense that something was off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept around and finally settled on the turbulent black vortex, which slightly calmed his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered coldly and said, "Are you still planning to struggle? Can you even do it? Although you are the Supreme Proto-Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, the only one in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom who can threaten me, do you think you still have a chance to win in this situation?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The exit of Necropolis City has been completely sealed by me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That black vortex won't calm down within ten days. No matter how you struggle, it's impossible for you to survive these ten days in Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have nowhere to hide; your death is inevitable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana sneered and retorted, "Oh? Are you sure there's nowhere to hide in Necropolis City? Do you really think you can kill us for sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't it?" Frederick shrugged, his face full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled silently and turned to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and slowly drew out the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was not only a spear capable of unleashing the power of an Imperial Artifact but also the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Osborne drew out the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, it felt as if everyone sensed its aura and turned their gaze toward him in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, their expressions changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This power... It's an Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, it truly is an Imperial Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd erupted into commotion, everyone staring at the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear in Osborne's hand, breathing heavily, their eyes filled with greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Frederick's eyes suddenly lit up, staring at Osborne's Violet-blooded Bronze Spear with a greedy gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A kid who just broke through to Empyrean Sacredness actually possesses an Imperial Artifact? My luck is incredible! Hand over your Imperial Artifact, and I'll spare your life!" Frederick shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was full of disdain. "Who do you think you are? Open your eyes wide and take a good look. This isn't just an ordinary Imperial Artifact; it's something you desperately crave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surroundings instantly fell into silence. Everyone stared at Osborne in disbelief, even Frederick's body trembled sharply, his eyes bursting with intense light, completely ignoring Osborne's insult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared intently at the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, his breathing growing rapid. "What... what did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket? The one who took the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket in advance... is actually you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "That's right, it's me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I hadn't taken the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket in advance, how could I have witnessed the spectacular scene of you personally killing your own children?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
