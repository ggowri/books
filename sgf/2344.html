  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After figuring it out, Osborne acted immediately. If he was late, he figured he could only collect Agatha's body, or there might not even be a body left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left his residence and used interdimensional travel to arrive at the entrance of Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mystic Sirius Sect's Clan Protective Formation was fully activated. With Osborne's current strength, he couldn't directly pass through the Clan Protective Formation using spatial power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he had to leave Mystic Sirius Sect through the entrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he was about to leave, Angela appeared and blocked his path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela frowned tightly, looked at Osborne in confusion, and asked, "Osborne, are you leaving Mystic Sirius Sect? Where are you planning to go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't expect to be stopped by Angela, so he felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment and quickly said, "I want to go out for some fresh air. The state duel lasted seven days. I feel a bit tense and can't calm down to cultivate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela nodded and said, "After going through consecutive battles in the state duel, you do need a good rest before cultivating. But you can't leave Mystic Sirius Sect. Just take a walk within Mystic Sirius Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne quickly said, "That's not good. Mystic Sirius Sect has so many disciples. Wherever I go, people will gather around me. I can't relax like that."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt delighted that he could come up with such a good excuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Angela calmly said, "Don't worry. You're now the treasure of Mystic Sirius Sect. If you don't want to be disturbed, no one will dare to bother you. I'll inform the senior members of Mystic Sirius Sect and order all disciples and elders not to disturb you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's very dangerous outside right now. At least several top warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level are fighting. The energy fluctuations from their battles cover the entire Zephyr State. Terrifying energy waves are everywhere outside, and only staying within the Clan Protective Formation is safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela pulled Osborne, ready to head back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Osborne felt a bit helpless. He knew Angela was concerned about him, worried he might be in danger outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had to rescue Agatha as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Bloodline Sensation, he felt Agatha's condition worsening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne could only say, "Ms. Olsen, thank you. But I have an important matter I must attend to right now. I have to temporarily leave Mystic Sirius Sect. If I'm late, something serious will happen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't lying to Angela. If he was late and Agatha was killed, it could indeed affect him. Worst case, he might even die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So</span><span> at this moment, Osborne stared at Angela with unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could feel Osborne's firm attitude and knew she couldn't stop him unless she tied him up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if she did that, Osborne would hate her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela thought for a moment and said, "What are you going to do? I can go with you. After all, I&rsquo;m a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, I can help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t want to involve Angela. After all, this matter had nothing to do with her. Angela was strong, but definitely not top-tier. If they encountered those who wanted to kill Agatha, Angela wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help and might even get into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne shook his head. "No, this is my personal matter. Ms. Olsen, please don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll be back soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne turned and walked out of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela opened her mouth, seemingly wanting to say something. But in the end, she said nothing, watching Osborne leave the Mystic Sirius Sect and then use spatial power to disappear from sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, even though Angela was a warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level, it would be very difficult for her to catch up with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. He's not stupid; he probably won't do anything foolish. He shouldn't go to dangerous places." With that, Angela went back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, after performing several interdimensional travels, Osborne had already arrived at Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed his eyes, sensed Agatha's current location, and then entered the translocator without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moonsea City." Osborne activated the translocator and chose a destination. Instantly, his body disappeared into the translocator. When he reappeared, he had already arrived in Moonsea City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moonsea City is not far from Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To the north of Moonsea City lies a vast ocean called Moon Sea. The ocean is shaped like a full moon, covering nearly half of Zephyr State, making it incredibly expansive. Even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior would need a long time to fly across Moonsea City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne sensed that Agatha was deep within the Moon Sea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still desperately fleeing, but her body was extremely weak, clearly severely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly arrived at the edge of Moon Sea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a terrifying rumble echoed from the center of Moon Sea, with energy waves surging everywhere. Everyone in Moonsea City hid away instantly, with no one wandering outside, fearing harm from the dreadful energy waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under these surging energy shocks, even Osborne's body felt some pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying battle was taking place deep within Moon Sea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle had spread all the way from Frost Peak City. Osborne guessed that the warriors from Phoenix City were escorting Agatha as she fled, while the warriors trying to kill Agatha were in hot pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Frost Peak City to Moonsea City, everything along the way was destroyed by this battle. The terrifying traces left behind shocked Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he gave it his all, he could never create such terrifying traces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the brutal battle deep within Moon Sea, Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of retreat in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he gritted his teeth and said, "Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne used spatial power to quickly head deeper into Moon Sea. With his current strength, the speed of his Phantom Steps was so fast that an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness couldn't catch up with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he quickly approached the center of the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the closer he got, the more Osborne felt an overwhelming pressure, even making interdimensional travel difficult. The terrifying energy fluctuations had already disrupted the surrounding space, causing massive spatial rifts to appear in the chaotic environment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the space in the Moon Sea area had become extremely dangerous. Even Osborne felt the threat of those spatial rifts and dared not approach recklessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What level of warriors could cause such a terrifying impact in a single battle? If this were on Celestara Planet, the entire Celestara Planet would probably have been destroyed," Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to perform interdimensional travel, Osborne's speed slowed down. He vaguely felt the distance between him and Agatha growing further and further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This won't do. With my strength, I can't even get close to the center of the battle. In that case, how can I save Agatha? It seems I must use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne quickly took out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Osborne entered the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and filled the energy core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum shot out, its speed even faster than Osborne's interdimensional travel.</span></p><div class="pagination">
