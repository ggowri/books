  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can I trade my Crystal Armor for an Imperial Artifact Armor? That's awesome!" Adriana was extremely excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, in the Dimensional Bag Osborne gave her, besides the Imperial Artifact Armor, there was also a weapon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana took out a pair of gauntlets from the Dimensional Bag. They were still radiating the energy of an Imperial Artifact, making Adriana extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She loved fighting with her fists, so gauntlets were her weapon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could master these Inferior Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves, her strength would greatly increase, even allowing her to defeat Frederick head-on&mdash;unless Frederick also had an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana looked at Osborne gratefully. "Did you exchange this from the Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana believed that Osborne could only have exchanged his battle points at the Celestial Spire to obtain the Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is too precious," Adriana frowned. "You gave me both the Imperial Artifact Armor and the Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves. What about you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I have the Crystal Armor you just took off. With my current strength, I can't use an Imperial Artifact; it would backfire on me instead. So, the Imperial Artifact Armor and Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves can only unleash their power in your hands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must master them quickly and leave your mark on them. Only then can we stand against Emperor Frederick."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't tell Adriana that he had more Imperial Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually had twenty sets of Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor, three sets of Mid-grade Imperial Artifact Armor, and one set of Superior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even had many types of Imperial Artifact weapons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't tell Adriana not because he didn't trust her, but because he was cautious. After all, the value of Imperial Artifacts was too high. If others knew he had dozens of Imperial Artifacts, many would come after him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, May was right there with them. Although Adriana said May was trustworthy, this was Osborne's first interaction with May, so he couldn't fully trust her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May looked at Adriana with envy because it was an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, Imperial Artifacts almost only existed in legends, and even Frederick had never revealed an Imperial Artifact to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Adriana instantly obtained two Imperial Artifacts that perfectly matched her. How could May not feel envious?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, these two Imperial Artifacts were actually given to her by a young man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is simply unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, May realized he had no intention of giving her an Imperial Artifact, and she felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she knew this was the normal situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne could take out an Imperial Artifact and give it to her, that would be strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Ms. Alba, do you have any Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor? Clara, Leroy, and Casey are also entering the Skyfall Casket. If they each have a Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor, their safety will be ensured."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana shook her head and said, "Fairy Moon Sect doesn't have many Supreme Sacred Artifact Armors. However, I do have a few armors, but they are only Legendary Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana immediately took out three armors. "These three Legendary Sacred Artifact Armors also have strong defense and suit you well. After all, even if I gave you a Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor, you wouldn't be able to activate it. Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor consumes a lot of Sacred Power. Just wearing it constantly drains your Sacred Power. Your cultivation level has just reached primary Empyrean Sacredness. If that's the case, your Sacred Power would likely be depleted very quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Clara and the other two were very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Alba. Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor is already enough for us." Saying this, the three of them quickly took the three Legendary Sacred Artifact Armors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled at Osborne again and said, "I still have a Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor. I'll give you one as well. For you, a Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor is more suitable than a Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne shook his head. "No. I don't care if the Supreme Sacred Artifact Armor consumes my Sacred Power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne waved his hand and said, "Before entering the Eighth Skyfall Casket, let's train for a while. I need to master the Crystal Armor first. Ms. Alba, you should also master the Imperial Artifact Armor and Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already applied a hundredfold Time Acceleration around us. With these Legendary Dragon Elixirs, we should be able to quickly master the newly acquired weapons and equipment."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Adriana immediately became excited. "I do need some time to master the Imperial Artifact Armor and Imperial Artifact Boxing Gloves. With the Legendary Dragon Elixir and hundredfold Time Acceleration, I only need a day at most to initially master these two Imperial Artifacts and enhance my strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Then let's train for a day," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said, "May, please protect us." Immediately, a force enveloped her, and she began training right away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also began training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the hundredfold Time Acceleration, one day in the outside world equals a hundred days, enough for Osborne to master the Crystal Armor. With the Crystal Armor, his defense will greatly improve, making him safer in the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Clara, Leroy, and Casey can also master the Legendary Sacred Artifact Armor. This will greatly enhance their defense and ensure greater safety.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne has already used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replicate their life essence. Even if they truly die in the Eighth Skyfall Casket, Osborne can resurrect them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking about resurrection, Osborne suddenly realized he had forgotten something very important&mdash;resurrecting Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reaching Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne was already capable of resurrecting Alfreda. However, at that time, he was in the Celestial Spire. The power of the Celestial Spire suppressed his resurrection ability, so he couldn't resurrect Alfreda then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, after leaving the Celestial Spire, Osborne can resurrect Alfreda immediately if he wishes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This matter isn't urgent for now," Osborne murmured. "I'm still in Necropolis City and about to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket. It's too dangerous here. With Alfreda's strength, she wouldn't survive in this place at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll resurrect Alfreda immediately after I come out of the Eighth Skyfall Casket and leave Necropolis City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne took the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne at this moment, the Legendary Dragon Elixir no longer has much effect, but it can help him master the Legendary Sacred Artifact Crystal Armor faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne left his mark on the Crystal Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put on the Crystal Armor and immediately felt it crazily absorbing his Sacred Power. Even though he was already at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, he still felt his Sacred Power draining rapidly, almost unable to hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Chaotic Spiritual Root quickly replenished his consumed Sacred Power, keeping it at its peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've successfully mastered the Crystal Armor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Osborne took out an incredibly ordinary-looking bow, the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was once called the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "In the Celestial Spire, Toby said that although the Apocalypse Bow was damaged and most of its power sealed, it is still equivalent to the most powerful Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Apocalypse Bow has not acknowledged me yet, so I can neither feel its power nor use it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What should I do to make the Apocalypse Bow acknowledge me? If I can use the Apocalypse Bow, my strength will greatly improve. By then, even facing Emperor Frederick, I won't be afraid."</span></p><div class="pagination">
