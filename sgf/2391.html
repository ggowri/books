  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Cosmic Translocator was finally activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The farther the destination, the more energy it consumes, and the larger the Cosmic Translocator required. Abyssal Planet is incredibly distant from Racial Convergence Planet, almost at the edge of this Stellar Region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless that planet holds extremely valuable resources, a translocator wouldn't be built there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the teleportation enveloped a thousand contestants, along with Gerald.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the other judges, they had already gone to Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, all the contestants disappeared from the translocator. Osborne only felt slightly dizzy, sensing the surrounding lights rapidly retreating as if traversing through galaxies. Suddenly, his body jolted, and he was already standing firmly again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew they had arrived at Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly looked outside the translocator and couldn't help but pause for a moment. It was </span><span>pitch</span><span> black outside, with no starlight visible, completely a situation where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed there were no other planets near Abyssal Planet; it hung lonely at the vast edge of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this Abyssal Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I feel like this Abyssal Planet is situated in the depths of an abyss, it's so dark. Luckily, we're all Supernal Deity Kings, so even without any light, we can still see," someone said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people, not quite used to such a dark environment, directly summoned power to ignite flames or emit light, illuminating the surroundings brightly but only covering a small area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Abyssal Planet seemed shrouded in a faint mist, and even the light emitted by light elemental metahumans couldn't penetrate it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, this is Abyssal Planet. Your zone duel officially begins now! Once you step out of the translocator, no rules will restrain you anymore. Do your best to fight for a higher rank!" Gerald said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he finished speaking, someone immediately dashed out of the translocator without hesitation, rushing quickly in the direction they had planned in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a resource planet that has been almost untouched, filled with various treasures and resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoever finds the good stuff first gets to keep it. With so many people competing, being a step ahead might secure a wealth of resources and treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, more than half of the contestants on the translocator had left. Most chose to head north or west of Abyssal Planet, while a few went south.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the east was almost untouched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the east of Abyssal Planet is an active volcanic area, with scorching, terrifying high temperatures and extreme danger during eruptions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The east of Abyssal Planet is the most dangerous area on the entire Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the volcanoes there contain Dark Mandala, each worth a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, only those aiming for the championship dare to venture into the eastern volcanic region, while others avoid it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, we're heading west first! Be careful in the east!" Leroy and Clara said to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "You too! Good luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara left, quickly heading toward the western desert region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he felt there was no need to rush. Although it was just a small resource planet, its size was enormous, not much smaller than </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only a thousand contestants, and it was impossible to explore the entire Abyssal Planet within ten days, even if they all possessed Quasi Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne was not in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until everyone had left, only Osborne and Gerald were left in the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aren't you going to explore?" Gerald looked at Osborne and said calmly, "I heard you bet nearly three million at the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino, wagering on yourself to win the championship. You don't even see your opponents as a threat, planning to crush them easily to take the title? Young man, you're quite confident!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's mouth twitched at the words, and he said, "That's just a little trick the casino pulled because they don't want me to win. As for confidence, I do have a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked out of the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "By the way, can I ask if our actions here will be projected onto the Racial Convergence Planet for people to watch?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded. "Of course. However, due to the great distance, there aren't many devices capable of projecting. Different judges will select some participants for filming and projection. These judges, at least mid or advanced Empyrean Sacredness, will remain hidden while filming and won't interfere with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking, his body flickered, and he instantly disappeared from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This kid, quite bold," Gerald murmured, "In this unfamiliar place, he actually dares to use spatial power for interdimensional travel. Isn't he afraid of ending up in a dangerous place? Is he courting death, just too naive, or confident in his abilities?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald finished thinking and said, "Judge No. 11, follow Osborne. This little guy might be interesting. Record everything about him and project it back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Someone responded in the shadows, then quickly disappeared, heading in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had now appeared a million kilometers away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he knew that in an unfamiliar environment, he couldn't recklessly use interdimensional travel; otherwise, if he ended up in a dangerous dead zone, he might die inexplicably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he dared to do so because he was confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in an extremely dark environment, the effect of Satan's Eye was not diminished. Without obstacles, Osborne's Satan's Eye could clearly see millions or even tens of millions of kilometers away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he could see those things with crystal-clear vision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne first used Satan's Eye to find a safe place millions of kilometers away before using spatial power to traverse over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This posed absolutely no danger to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his speed was much faster than normal travel. This was also why he wasn&rsquo;t in a hurry to set off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Out of a thousand contestants, at most thirty chose to search for resources and treasures in the volcanic area on the eastern side of Abyssal Planet. These thirty are the strongest, the ones most likely to make the top ten, or even win the championship..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "It seems everyone&rsquo;s thoughts are quite similar to mine! To achieve good results, or even win, we can only go after those high-value resources and treasures!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Dark Mandala in the volcanic area on the eastern side of Abyssal Planet is not only my target but theirs as well. However, I have spatial power, allowing me to reach the eastern volcanic area faster than them! I also have Satan's Eye, giving me a higher chance of finding the Dark Mandala..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The championship is mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne used spatial power again, traveling millions of kilometers away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Valentino, Brenda, and others who also chose to head east had already been left far behind by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Judge No. 11, a warrior with advanced Empyrean Sacredness, couldn't catch up with Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
