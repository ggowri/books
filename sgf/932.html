Serena questioned, her face a mix of disbelief and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "With the Augustine Estate being surrounded by two top-tier Class S warriors, who on earth could possibly come to the aid of the Draco Armed Services Branch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a subtle smile. "Ms. Hernandez, you'll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he tore open a dimensional rift once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne guided Serena and her four companions through to Blood Demon Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backup he referred to was none other than the over five thousand members of the Blood Demon organization, all of whom he had been training here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they descended onto the island, they made no effort to conceal their presence, and it wasn't long before the Blood Demon members noticed Osborne's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the Blood Demon members rushed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, gesturing for everyone to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five women stood there, dumbfounded, as they took in the staggering sight of five thousand Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in disbelief; they exchanged glances and gasped, realizing that the weakest among them were all Class A!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Five thousand Class A warriors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where does all this power come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of pride swelled within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These members of the Blood Demon had initially been secretly trained by Sebastian and divided into ten different training bases, and their skills were nothing to write home about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But recently, thanks to Osborne's influence and the power of Blood Cross, they had all been transformed into Blood Clan members, with even the weakest among them reaching Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class AAA fighters among them exceeded ten, while more than a hundred had achieved Class AA status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While this strength was still a far cry from the Draco Armed Services Branch, let alone the Aberrants, the potential within these fighters was enormous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Blood Clan members, with Osborne's provision of Blood Cross' enriched blood energy, they could rapidly advance without the usual barriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, after absorbing a Dark Deity's blood energy, the Blood Cross had become even more potent and dynamic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to consolidate the abundant energy within the Blood Cross into blood energy, allowing the Blood Demon members to absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would undoubtedly boost their power significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Armed Services Branch was still on the run from the Aberrants; the sooner he got there, the more lives he could save. Delay could mean their total annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tapped into the potency of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After imbibing the Dark Deity's blood energy, the Blood Cross had gained a new level of vitality, enabling it to store even greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to condense the blood energy before him&mdash;one drop, two drops, then a hundred, two hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for countless droplets of blood energy to form in front of him, the sheer number reaching over five thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These new droplets were not only more dynamic but also denser in energy than those Osborne had conjured before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members stared at the sight, eyes turning red with anticipation. They felt an overwhelming compulsion to transform, and one by one, they shifted into their Vampire forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Serena and her group found themselves in awe, not fully comprehending Osborne's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But witnessing over five thousand individuals morph into Vampires sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood silently, choosing not to interrupt as they observed the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!" Osborne commanded, pouring the energy from the Blood Cross into the thousands of droplets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle flick of his wrist, the blood energy shot forth, each droplet landing perfectly before its respective Blood Demon member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb it immediately!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his order, the Blood Demon members sprang into action, each of them gulping down the blood energy as they began to rapidly refine and absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each member at least at Class A, their absorption rate was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the sheer magnitude of the blood energy was overwhelming; it took a full two hours before the last Blood Demon member finally finished absorbing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the energy radiating from that member surged dramatically, elevating their status from Class A to Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Serena and the others stood utterly stunned, their faces a mixture of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had they witnessed during these two hours?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five thousand members of the Blood Demon had absorbed the blood energy, and nearly all of them had broken through to the next level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them had reached at least Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class AA members, which had only been a little over a hundred, skyrocketed to an astonishing 1200.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Class AAA members, which had previously numbered just twelve, now surged to a hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "A hundred Class AAA?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve hundred Class AA?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of the five thousand is above Class A+?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power might still fall short compared to the Aberrants, but when measured against the Draco Armed Services Branch, they are definitely on equal footing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is this even possible?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
