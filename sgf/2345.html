  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum has two driving modes. One is powered directly by Osborne using Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with Osborne's current Sacred Power, he can drive the Ascending Sacred Sanctum but cannot unleash its true power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only by using a large number of Sacred Crystals to power the Ascending Sacred Sanctum can its full potential, such as speed, be unleashed. At this point, its speed surpasses most warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level, even with 70% of its propulsion runes destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't damaged, its speed would definitely not be slower than any top warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defense runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum are also 90% destroyed. However, if the remaining runes are fully activated, its defense would be terrifying, making it impossible for ordinary warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, with the protection of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Osborne felt much more at ease. The terrifying battle ripples and surging energy over the Moon Sea could no longer affect him. He could clearly sense that the distance between him and Agatha was getting closer and closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Hold on a little longer. Just hold on a little longer, and I can replicate your life essence. By then, even if you're killed, I can bring you back to life. Even if I can't revive you temporarily, I will definitely be able to do it in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne grew anxious because he could feel Agatha's aura weakening and her condition worsening.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, deep within the Moon Sea, a terrifying battle erupted fiercely. The horrifying energy waves nearly overturned the entire Moon Sea, and the towering waves were instantly evaporated by the energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of men in black was attacking frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood kept flowing from the corner of Agatha's mouth, her face deathly pale. The Ember Phoenix Clan warriors around her were gradually unable to hold on, while a bitter smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Am I ultimately unable to survive?" Agatha murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha, hold on," Zebulon Hiram, the chief of the Ember Phoenix Clan, shouted to Agatha. "You are the first in a hundred thousand years of the Ember Phoenix Clan to awaken the Dark Phoenix Bloodline. Even if we all die here, we will protect you and ensure your escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must hold on. More Ember Phoenix Clan warriors will arrive soon. We've even contacted the deeper cosmos Ember Phoenix Clan. As long as you endure until they arrive, no one on the Racial Convergence Planet can harm you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could live, she certainly didn't want to die. She also wanted to hold on. But she really couldn't anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although protected by numerous Ember Phoenix Clan warriors, she was still injured. The group attacking her wore black masks, concealing their aura and making their exact identities unclear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they were all top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of ten top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if all the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors on the Racial Convergence Planet were mobilized, it would be impossible to defeat them, let alone protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, those black-masked warriors didn't want to reveal their identities, so they didn't use Sacred Artifacts or overly powerful Divine Ascendance Techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors would have long been unable to hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you all. But things have come to this, and too many warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan have already died for me. You don't need to worry about me anymore. All of you, leave," Agatha said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fleeing from Frost Peak City to Moon Sea, Agatha watched one Ember Phoenix Clan warrior after another die at the hands of those ten warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She truly couldn't bear it anymore, thinking, "I can die, but I can't let the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet lose more lives because of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha, shut up," an elder of the Ember Phoenix Clan said. "You are the Dark Phoenix. Even if everyone in the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet dies, as long as you are alive, it is worth it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another elder agreed, "That's right. We can all die, but you must live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A clansman shouted, "Fight! Even if it costs our lives, we can't let them kill the Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other clansmen loudly echoed, "Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle grew fiercer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ember Phoenix Clan had only two top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, Zebulon and the deputy clan leader. Although the other elders were powerful, they did not reach the level of top-tier warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing ten top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, even without using Sacred Artifacts and relying solely on pure Sacred Power attacks, the Ember Phoenix Clan couldn't withstand them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One elder after another from the Ember Phoenix Clan was torn apart and killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's eyes were now filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ember Phoenix Clan, you can't stop us," said one of the warriors wearing a black mask. "The Dark Phoenix shouldn't exist on the Racial Convergence Planet, nor in the cosmos. She must die. If you hand over the Dark Phoenix, we can let you go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person's voice was strange, clearly disguised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zebulon snorted coldly and angrily said, "Who exactly are you? Why do you hide your faces? If you have the guts, show your true selves. If you dare to kill our clan's Dark Phoenix, I will wipe out your families."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan arrive, none of you will escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That warrior looked extremely calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "Since we dare to show up, we are not afraid of the Ember Phoenix Clan's revenge. Besides, by the time the Ember Phoenix Clan's warriors arrive at the Racial Convergence Planet, the Dark Phoenix will already be dead. So, stop wasting words. I'll give you one last chance&mdash;hand over the Dark Phoenix. Otherwise, you all die together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a terrifying killing intent enveloped the entire Moon Sea. Even Zebulon's expression couldn't help but turn extremely grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This warrior's true strength is greater than mine. In fact, on the Racial Convergence Planet, his power could definitely rank in the top five. So, who is he?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he the Emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Or the King of the Evernight Court? Or perhaps the master of the Phantom Commerce Guild?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zebulon's expression was extremely grim. He gritted his teeth and said, "Stop dreaming. We will never hand over the Dark Phoenix. If you have the ability, then kill us all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That warrior let out a cold snort. Instantly, the surrounding temperature plummeted. The entire Moon Sea was frozen at that moment, with terrifying energy waves surging wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Since you want to die, I'll grant your wish. No one can save the Dark Phoenix, including you. Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, ten top warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level attacked again. The warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan fought desperately to resist, but they couldn't hold them off. As they fell one by one, their numbers dwindled, leaving them unable to protect Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha spat out a mouthful of blood. The shockwave of the force made her </span><span>whole body</span><span> tremble, her bones fracturing inch by inch, and her internal organs showing cracks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those ten top warriors were simply too terrifying. Despite the Ember Phoenix Clan giving it their all, they still failed to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha seemed to see death approaching.</span></p><div class="pagination">
