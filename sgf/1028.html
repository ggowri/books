  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine Estate was 2500 miles away from Bryce's </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they were flying, it would take hours to get there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had spatial power, enabling him to jump over 120 miles with each interdimensional trip. With this ability, he only needed to perform twenty jumps to reach the outskirts of </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, he could effortlessly carry Kendra along without needing </span><span>any breaks, making it possible to complete those twenty jumps back-to-back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in just about a minute, Osborne found himself 2500 miles away, standing above the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "If I can push my spatial power to the next level, I might only need a blink of an eye to reach any corner of Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire planet would feel like a small town to me then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Gerardo's spatial power is even stronger than mine. With a Level Three Spatial Domain, he can cover at least 497 miles or even 600 miles in one jump! Plus, he can seal off space, making interdimensional travel impossible for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to break through to Level Three with my own Spatial Domain to ensure I'm no longer be limited by his sealing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head; he didn't think Gerardo would show up here personally to deal with </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain. Still, he shouldn't underestimate the potential encounter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he crossed paths with Gerardo now, escaping might not even be an option. After all, Osborne couldn't rely on luck forever. Gerardo's fusion with the god's corpse couldn't always fail and steal him the opportunity like last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his attention back to Kendra, he asked, "Kendra, which way to </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra pointed quickly, her voice steady despite her distress. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, about 30 miles! And I have a strong feeling my brother is in that direction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had a unique talent&mdash;once she'd seen someone, she could sense their power signatures, no matter how far they ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce's sister, she easily remembered his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grasped Kendra's hand and did another interdimensional travel leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they crossed the 30 miles, and Osborne's eyes landed on an island emerging from the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This island was shrouded in an ever-present fog, and at its heart stood a towering peak: </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pirate crew led by Bryce was named after this very mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the scene was devastating&mdash;the mountain lay in ruins, its buildings demolished, and even the peak seemed to have suffered severe damage, clearly the aftermath of a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only someone of Class S strength could cause such destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's face turned ghostly pale as she saw the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had grown up on </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain; it was her home. Seeing it in shambles, with corpses scattered everywhere, made her tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was sad, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain pirate crew, established by Kendra's parents and led by Bryce, had numbered around eight thousand pirates, each one a Class A powerhouse. Their strength rivaled that of the Draco Armed Services Branch at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? They were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, grimly calculating, "8,000 elite Class A warriors were wiped out in </span><span>one go&mdash;what kind of power does that take?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least 100 Class S clones would be needed to accomplish such devastation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of the situation weighed heavy on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had personally taken down several Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if thirty Class S clones targeted him at once, he would be in serious trouble. Fifty? It would be impossible to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "And here, there could well be over a hundred Class S clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just hope the ones hunting Bryce aren't too many."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t flinch, turning to Kendra with resolute eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, now's not the time for sorrow. We need to find your brother! Focus and guide me to his location!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra snapped out of her daze, hastily wiping away her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother's still ahead, but I can't know the exact distance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, gripping Kendra's arm as they warped through 120 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still ahead!" Kendra&rsquo;s voice tinged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed on, and Kendra's voice grew more urgent. "Still ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can sense him! He's just 25 miles away, and he seems to be underwater!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's excitement bubbled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"25 miles? Underwater?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate, immediately initiating an interdimensional travel to a desolate expanse of sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, "Let me check Bryce's condition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to see how many Class S clones there are before we make our move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rush to approach, mindful of potential ambushes. With Satan's Eye active, he could see everything within six miles without alerting the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew grave as he took in the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sixty Class S clones!" Osborne's voice was a mix of awe and dread.</span></p><div class="pagination">
