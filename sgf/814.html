  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Cuthbert was formidable, Osborne's super energy pistol represented the pinnacle of energy weaponry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Its power wasn't solely dependent on Osborne's own strength; rather, his energy merely served as a catalyst to activate the Divine Bone Crystal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The divine power within the Divine Bone Crystal was so immense that even a Class S Supreme Overlord would need to be cautious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Osborne expending all his remaining strength to fully activate the Divine Bone Crystal, the power of this bullet was catastrophic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how powerful Cuthbert was, he was still only a Class AAA, and ultimately, he couldn't withstand the assault.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Cuthbert's body exploded, Osborne collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath. Had this final shot not been enough to finish Cuthbert, he would have had to use the Light of Redemption to recover.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Cuthbert was dead!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes lit up as he surveyed the wreckage. Among the debris lay a divine artifact gem and a formidable divine artifact staff.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a quick surge of adrenaline, he scrambled to his feet, grabbed the staff, and clutched the Powerstone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered, "So Cuthbert's power was so overwhelming because of his fusion with the Powerstone?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect it to still be here after his death.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Looks like he didn't merge completely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Cuthbert's power was so great without full integration, this Powerstone must be something special. I wonder if I could merge with it to enhance my own physical abilities?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the Powerstone in his hand suddenly burst into brilliant light.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face paled; he feared it might explode. Instinctively, he tried to fling the Powerstone away, knowing the destructive potential of a divine artifact's explosion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to his shock, the Powerstone seemed to adhere to his hand, no matter how hard he tried to shake it off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Slowly, it began to merge into his flesh and blood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? It's really merging?" Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tried to sense any changes, but found his body remained the same.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frowning, Osborne wondered, "Could it be that the Powerstone's power isn't as formidable as I thought? Or perhaps... I haven't merged with it thoroughly enough? The more complete the fusion, the greater the power boost?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He focused intently on the Powerstone, which was now settling in his chest, seemingly trying to occupy his heart as its new anchor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, within his heart lay the ancient Blood Cross.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the Blood Cross sensed the Powerstone, it erupted with a terrifying force, striking the Powerstone away in an instant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gaped, thinking, "My Blood Cross just knocked the Powerstone away?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It looks like the Blood Cross is on a whole different level!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to penetrate Osborne's heart, the Powerstone redirected itself to his lower abdomen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, Osborne felt the Powerstone merging with his body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His entire being seemed to undergo a radical transformation. Every cell felt invigorated, brimming with newfound energy and vitality.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aah!!" Osborne couldn't help but let out a low roar, experiencing a sudden surge in his physical prowess and a rapid rise in his realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne felt himself break through a barrier.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Class AAA!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned. The Powerstone's integration had pushed him directly into Class AAA. Yet, the transformation wasn't over; his body continued to evolve, growing stronger and more resilient, as if it was brimming with untapped power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Osborne felt invincible, as though he could crush a mountain into dust with his bare fists.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ten minutes, the changes finally subsided.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne tested his new strength, his face alight with amazement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He muttered, "This is incredible! With this power, I could take on Cuthbert head-on even without the Breath of Celestial or transforming into a Vampire!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if Cuthbert used the Strength Realm, he wouldn't stand much of a chance against me now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His excitement was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, an intense wave of fear washed over him, and Satan's Eye began to pulse erratically.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh no!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face went white with alarm as he tried to flee, but in the next instant, he found himself paralyzed, a crushing force binding him in place.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A Class S Supreme Overlord!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic surged through Osborne.</p><div class="pagination">
