Their backing forces, businesses, and crimes are all here!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan handed the information to Osborne. His face was full of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already looked through the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the evil deeds of those underground gangs had made even him feel a chill </span><span>down his spine and filled him with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was just too cruel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being born into the Augustine family, he could never have imagined that these underground gangs, which he looked down upon, could be so cruel and mad toward ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're practically demons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially these ten underground gangs. The people in these ten gangs are complete scum. Every one of them deserves to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've killed who knows how many people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan spoke angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly looked through the information. As he read page after page, his expression grew colder and angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan hadn't exaggerated at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he had been quite restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The actions of the ten gangs that were particularly noted were enough to make anyone's skin crawl. The sins they committed against ordinary people were enough to warrant killing them ten times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading the information, Osborne let out a cold snort. His eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you planning to do?" Nathan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think? We'll kill them all! Not knowing before was one thing. Now that we know, we can't let these people live!" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was overjoyed to hear this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let me handle this. Give me three days, and I'll take them out myself," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and then said, "No need to go to that much trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the name of the Augustine family, gather all the underground gangs in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Tell them I have a big deal to discuss with them! Especially the ten major gangs, make sure their leaders are there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell them if anyone dares not to come, they can forget about surviving in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was stunned but didn't ask questions and just nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go do it now!" said Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the underground gangs in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> received the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was gathering all underground gangs for a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, all the underground gangs were in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their level, they had no idea that the five great ancient families, including the Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families, had been wiped out by the Augustine family and had become their vassals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they all knew that the ancient families were not to be messed with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the summons from the Augustine family, they were puzzled but still had no choice but to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost all the gang leaders personally brought their men to the meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also curious about what kind of big deal the Augustine family wanted to make with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one day, over a hundred underground gangs from </span><span>Dampston</span><span> gathered at the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each gang leader brought at least dozens of followers, resulting in thousands of people crowding the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how arrogant or wild the gang leaders were outside, they became extremely subdued at the Augustine Estate. No one dared to cause trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only gathered with those they knew, quietly discussing what the Augustine family might be planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, all the gang members had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, surrounded by Augustine family members, appeared before the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold gaze swept over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, everyone looked at Osborne, feeling as though his gaze was like a sharp blade, leaving them chilled to the bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is he?" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, but he's definitely someone important! Didn't you see how everyone from the Augustine family looked at him with admiration and respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A big shot like that isn't someone we can mess with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder what big deal he wants to make with us? He probably wants to use our networks and collaborate with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, these ancient families always act so righteous. They don't want to dirty their hands with shady stuff, so they pass it on to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what they want us to do, we should agree. If we can get in with an ancient family, we'll be set for life. No one will dare mess with us again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a loud shout echoed as Nathan stepped forward and coldly said, "If anyone dares to whisper, don't blame me for killing them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd felt a bit of fear. Deep down, they were disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is? If he wasn't born into that family, he'd be nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what they have to say first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they don't offer us a good deal, I couldn't care less about them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd mulled over their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan turned to look at Osborne, waiting for his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded slightly and said calmly, "Let's begin. Announce their crimes so they die knowing why."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan finished speaking, a cold smile spreading across his face as he pulled out a stack of documents.</span></p><div class="pagination">
