  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? Are they really going to gang up on him?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd exclaimed in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Leo is a member of the Personal Guards, a direct subordinate of Paul, and incredibly strong. It&rsquo;s one thing for him to take action, but to gang up on him too?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He is done for. He&rsquo;ll definitely be destroyed!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul is completely enraged now!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was discussing, all believing that Osborne was doomed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Osborne had defeated Charles and Jason, showing strength not inferior to the Personal Guards members, no one thought he could withstand Leo and the combined attack of ten bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard team, besides Paul, probably no one else could manage it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not even the three vice-captains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Boy, are you scared? Too bad, it&rsquo;s too late now. Even if you kneel and beg me, I won&rsquo;t let you go. You will pay for your arrogance.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul sneered, then suddenly waved his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Attack, destroy him!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At his command, Leo and the ten others launched their assault. They were all Paul&rsquo;s direct subordinates, working in perfect coordination, surrounding Osborne and attacking from all sides, leaving him no escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet Osborne remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Facing the Personal Guards, Leo, plus ten elite bodyguards, he felt the pressure. If he chose to reveal his full strength, he could easily defeat them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne had no intention of doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instead, he suddenly drew a gun from his holster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next second, with a few gunshots, the eleven men rushing towards Osborne abruptly stopped, their faces darkening as they stared at the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At their feet were bullet holes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These bullet holes were precisely calculated, only one inch away from their toes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eleven bullet holes, perfectly placed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leo&rsquo;s face turned grim as he glared at the Dragon H-type gun in Osborne&rsquo;s hand, his eye twitching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How dare you shoot?&rdquo; Leo shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In previous fights, everyone had tacitly agreed not to use guns, relying on fists and feet. They all assumed Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t use a gun either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered. &ldquo;You all shamelessly ganged up on me. Why can&rsquo;t I? Do you expect me to stand here stupidly and let you hit me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Your brains are not working, but mine is.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leo couldn&rsquo;t find a retort, only turning to Paul for orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul snorted. &ldquo;If he can shoot, why can&rsquo;t you? He has just one gun, you have eleven.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Leo and the others understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, some moved to draw their guns from their holsters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone fired at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sound of gunshots was incessant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the next moment, several screams rang out. The bodyguards who had just touched their guns found their wrists precisely shot, causing them to cry out in pain, clutching their wrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leo and the remaining bodyguards froze, their hands hovering over their holsters, too scared to draw their guns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smirked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You can try. See if you&rsquo;re faster at drawing your guns or I am at shooting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leo&rsquo;s face darkened further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Useless!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul roared, not expecting his eleven elite subordinates to be so helpless against Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stepped forward, moving towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I underestimated you. But your good days are over. Now, I&rsquo;ll personally teach you a lesson. Go ahead, try to shoot me. Let&rsquo;s see if your toy gun can hurt me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne scoffed and fired without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two bullets flew at terrifying speed, hitting Paul&rsquo;s shoulder in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But to Osborne&rsquo;s shock, the bullets didn&rsquo;t hurt Paul at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They didn&rsquo;t even pierce his skin, merely compressing and falling aside like they had hit steel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul brushed his shoulder disdainfully and continued walking towards Osborne, unscathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What an incredible body!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was astonished. No wonder Paul was Clarissa&rsquo;s chief bodyguard. With such a physique, he could ignore ordinary firearms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I am immune to sniper bullets,&rdquo; Paul sneered. &ldquo;Dare to fight me? You&rsquo;re too na&iuml;ve. In my eyes, you&rsquo;re nothing but trash. Now, kneel.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul finished and was about to attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A stern voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, three figures, two women and one man, quickly approached, blocking Paul&rsquo;s path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said coldly, &ldquo;Harris, Violet, Sharon, you three vice-captains, are you here to stop me from teaching him a lesson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was surprised at these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He scrutinized the three and wondered, &ldquo;Were these the vice-captains? Were they here to help me? Or did they have a bad relationship with Paul?&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
