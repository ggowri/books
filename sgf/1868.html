  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the massive defensive wall made up of countless dragons, unable to hide his shock. "It can block attacks from ten opponents of the same level? That powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was clearly skeptical. Zachary seemed to notice Osborne's doubt and chuckled, "This is only the second time I've used the Draconic Formation. The first time, I saved over six thousand members of the Hudson family. Afterward, I had to use the white Miracle Elixir just to recover. Since it's rare to get a chance to use the Draconic Formation, and you don't seem convinced of its strength, I'll let you see for yourself just how powerful it really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Zachary turned and called out to a group nearby. "All of you, attack together. Let our nephew see just how strong the Hudson family's Draconic Formation is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Osborne's uncles and aunts all came forward, smiling broadly. "Alright, Osborne. All seventeen of us are at the highest Deity King Level. We'll go all out and let you see just what the Draconic Formation can handle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they finished speaking, Osborne's eleven uncles&mdash;except for Zachary&mdash;along with the newly recovered Seth and Osborne's six aunts unleashed their divine power in a wild surge. Every one of them was at the highest Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!" In the blink of an eye, all seventeen of them unleashed their full strength, aiming directly at the Draconic Formation that Zachary had summoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the sheer intensity&mdash;they weren't holding back at all. Their divine power was fully unleashed as seventeen powerful attacks smashed into the Draconic Formation with an earth-shattering rumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening roar echoed wildly, causing the Hudson family soldiers training on the other side of the drill ground to pause and turn their attention to the commotion. Some even attempted to approach, but under Tristan's intervention, they stayed back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, another thunderous explosion followed. Osborne watched closely as the seventeen powerful attacks landed on the Draconic Formation, causing it to flicker violently but remain intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the force behind the seventeen attacks was spent. Although the Draconic Formation dimmed considerably, it held strong and withstood a second wave of attacks. It wasn't until the third round that the formation finally shattered. Osborne was stunned by the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredible defense! Uncle Zachary was being modest just now. Blocking two full-force attacks from seventeen opponents of the same level? No wonder it's called a deadly forbidden technique. If it didn't have side effects, this would practically be a divine skill," Osborne remarked, his eyes gleaming with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the Draconic Formation shattered, Zachary's presence grew faint, and his vitality began to drain rapidly as though it were leaking from a funnel. Without hesitation, Osborne activated the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, swiftly restoring Zachary's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne was finished, he said eagerly, "Uncle Zachary, I want to learn the Draconic Formation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary chuckled, "Of course, no problem. You're part of the Hudson family, so naturally, you can learn the Draconic Formation. Besides, only in your hands can it unleash its true power. After all, you're the only one who isn't afraid of the Draconic Formation's side effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Zachary spoke, he reached out and tapped Osborne lightly on the forehead. Immediately, a stream of information about the Draconic Formation flooded Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne closed his eyes and quickly began to comprehend it. His aptitude was extraordinary, and with the help of the large amounts of black Miracle Elixir he had consumed, he grasped the Draconic Formation in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary spoke up again, trying to reassure him, "No need to rush, Osborne. The Draconic Formation is a tricky martial art&mdash;it's not that easy to master. Spend more time on it, and in a month or two, you'll get the hang of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, a smile spreading across his face. "Uncle Zachary, I've already mastered it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, divine power surged around him and ignited with a loud boom. Immediately after, countless divine dragons erupted from his body, forming an enormous, unyielding protective wall before him. In an instant, the place fell into utter silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's jaw dropped as he stared at Osborne in disbelief. Seeing Osborne's Draconic Formation&mdash;larger and sturdier than his own&mdash;left him completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's other uncles and aunts were equally dumbfounded. One of them couldn't help but exclaim, "Osborne has already mastered the Draconic Formation this quickly? And why is his version so powerful? It's even stronger than what we, at the highest Deity King Level, can manage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was frozen in shock. Osborne, however, ignored their reactions. Savoring the power of the Draconic Formation, he felt immensely satisfied. He then asked, "Uncle Zachary, can the Draconic Formation be fused?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's question snapped everyone out of their daze. They exchanged strange glances, looking at Osborne as if he were some kind of freak. After all, it had taken each of them at least a month or two to master the Draconic Formation, yet Osborne had done it in mere moments. His comprehension ability was nothing short of monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What made it worse&mdash;or perhaps more incredible&mdash;was that Osborne's cultivation level was clearly only mid Deity King Level. Yet, his Draconic Formation was stronger than what they could achieve, even at the highest Deity King Level. It was downright abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's question, Zachary quickly said, "That's right. The strongest feature of the Draconic Formation is that it can be fused."</span></p><div class="pagination">
