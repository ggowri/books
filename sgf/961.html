  <div class="container"><p>The terrifying power of petrification bore down on the injured Osborne and Sebastian, their bodies succumbing to the relentless force.</p><p>Despite their desperate attempts to resist, they felt themselves turning to stone, helpless against the overwhelming might of Gerardo, who loomed over them like a god.</p><p>At that moment, Osborne truly sensed the cold breath of death creeping closer.</p><p>&quot;Is this how it ends for us?&quot; Osborne thought, his heart racing.</p><p>Both he and Sebastian were gravely wounded, stripped of any ability to fight back. Sebastian&#x27;s injuries were particularly severe; he had taken a direct hit from Gerardo while trying to protect Osborne.</p><p>Even if Gerardo ceased his assault without immediate medical attention, Sebastian wouldn&#x27;t last long.</p><p>His breath was shallow as he turned to Osborne, his voice frail.</p><p>&quot;Osborne, I&#x27;m so sorry! I&#x27;ve dragged you into this. Over twenty years ago, I failed to protect your parents, and now... now I can&#x27;t protect you either.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not a good father, nor a good grandfather,&quot; Sebastian murmured, guilt etched across his face.</p><p>&quot;No, Grandpa, it&#x27;s not your fault! You&#x27;ve done enough for us! We&#x27;re not going to die here, I promise you!&quot; Osborne insisted, desperation fueling his words.</p><p>His mind raced, searching for a solution. He couldn&#x27;t accept this fate, not like this.</p><p>But the gap in their power was insurmountable.</p><p>Gerardo had fused with the corpse of the Medusa deity, gaining godlike strength. Osborne understood that Gerardo must have paid a heavy price for such power, and it wouldn&#x27;t last forever.</p><p>But at this moment, all it took was a flick of Gerardo&#x27;s finger to end them.</p><p>&quot;What can we do now?&quot; Osborne thought, his gaze fixed on Gerardo, who approached them slowly, a cat playing with its prey.</p><p>A cold smirk danced on his face, filled with disdain.</p><p>&quot;Time to die!&quot; Gerardo declared, raising his hand to deliver the final blow.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous roar shattered the tension.</p><p>Dozens of attacks sliced through the air, hurtling toward Gerardo.</p><p>&quot;Kill him!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Godfather, we&#x27;re here to save you!&quot;</p><p>In a heartbeat, over thirty figures surged forward, their eyes ablaze with fury.</p><p>It was the Draco Armed Services Branch—thirty-five members who hadn&#x27;t fled but had instead thrown themselves into the fray, determined to save their fallen leader.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s heart jolted. But their strength paled in comparison to Gerardo&#x27;s.</p><p>&quot;Fools!&quot; Gerardo sneered, waving a hand dismissively.</p><p>The attacks disintegrated before they could even reach him, and with a surge of power, Gerardo unleashed a devastating punch.</p><p>&quot;No!</p><p>&quot;Run away! Leave us alone!&quot; Sebastian shouted, but it was too late.</p><p>Gerardo&#x27;s fist descended with horrifying speed. The first few members of the Draco Armed Services Branch exploded upon impact, their defenses crumbling like paper against sheer force. They were reduced to nothing more than a gruesome spray of flesh and bone.</p><p>Yet, the remaining soldiers pressed on, unyielding in their resolve, charging at Gerardo with reckless abandon.</p><p>&quot;Kill him!&quot;</p><p>Gerardo scoffed, unleashing a flurry of punches. Each strike felled several men before they even reached him. The thirty-plus Class AAA members of the Draco Armed Services Branch didn&#x27;t stand a chance against his overwhelming power.</p><p>Tears streamed down Sebastian&#x27;s face as he watched his loyal soldiers fall one by one.</p><p>He coughed up blood, his fury directed at Gerardo.</p><p>Osborne felt an unbearable weight in his chest.</p><p>The members of the Draco Armed Services Branch knew they were no match for Gerardo.</p><p>They understood they couldn&#x27;t save Sebastian, yet they charged forward without a hint of fear, driven by their loyalty to Sebastian.</p><p>&quot;Gerardo!&quot; Sebastian growled, his voice low and filled with fury.</p><p>Gerardo said, a cruel smile twisting his lips, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Feeling a little sentimental? Don&#x27;t worry; once I&#x27;ve put you and your grandson to rest, I&#x27;ll move on to Rosmandi. I&#x27;ll take over every single asset of the Draco Group and wipe out every last soul associated with it! And as for the Augustine family, I&#x27;ll relish in personally seeing their downfall!</p><p>&quot;Sebastian, you can rest easy knowing that everyone connected to you will soon join you in hell. You&#x27;ve lost!&quot;</p><p>With those chilling words, Gerardo prepared to strike once more.</p><p>But suddenly, an unexpected change flickered across his face. The divine power surrounding him began to tremble violently, brimming with agitation and chaos.</p><p>His body contorted, twisting in alarm.</p><p>Gerardo bellowed, panic creeping into his voice, &quot;Damn it! What the hell is going on?</p><p>&quot;Calm down! Even if you&#x27;re a god, you&#x27;re already dead! Your corpse is meant to be my puppet, your power should be under my control!&quot;</p><p>He dropped to a seated position, desperately trying to rein in the wild surge of divine power that threatened to spiral out of control.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s eyes widened with realization.</p><p>&quot;Gerardo&#x27;s power is unraveling; he&#x27;s fighting to suppress the chaotic energy!</p><p>&quot;This is our chance!</p><p>&quot;Light of Redemption!&quot;</p><p>Bright rays enveloped Osborne, dissipating the stony shell that had clung to him. At long last, he was free. Without a moment&#x27;s hesitation, he brandished the Goddess of Grain&#x27;s scythe and charged towards Gerardo.</p><p>&quot;Die!&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
