  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a terrifying explosion, Osborne noticed the Ascending Sacred Sanctum being blown away, tumbling countless times in the air before stabilizing far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned and then saw that the vast Moon Sea below had completely vanished, leaving only a deep crater.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne frowned deeply. The power of that explosion just now was truly terrifying. If he hadn't been in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he would have been completely torn apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was incredibly far from the explosion site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Someone self-destructed. Not just one person, but twenty people in succession. Could it be the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was grim, thinking, "Am I too late? The warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan have all self-destructed, clearly because they couldn't withstand the enemy's attack. They could only try to die with the enemy this way. Is Agatha already dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly closed his eyes to sense. Then, a look of surprise appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha is actually still alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although her condition was very bad, even in a coma, she was indeed still alive. Moreover, she was no longer on the Racial Convergence Planet but in a </span><span>place</span><span> Osborne was familiar with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne figured it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Maybe the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors couldn't withstand the attack, so they forcibly tore through space, throwing Agatha into deep space, and then used self-destruction to stop the enemy from pursuing her. After all, deep space is extremely complex. Even top-level warriors at Empyrean Sacredness would find it difficult to search for Agatha in deep space."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ember Phoenix Clan warriors throwing Agatha into deep space was the only way. If they hadn't done so, they couldn't have stopped the enemy or protected Agatha. In that case, Agatha would surely have died. Now, at least Agatha has a slim chance of survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, deep space is incredibly dangerous. Most importantly, Agatha is already unconscious, and she could be swept into the terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence in deep space at any moment. I must find her immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne began to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed spatial power. No matter where he was, he could tear through space and enter deep space. Moreover, with the Bloodline Sensation between him and Agatha, he could pinpoint her approximate location. So, finding Agatha in deep space wouldn't be difficult for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne entered deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sensing Agatha's location, Osborne quickly rushed over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, ten people stood above the ruins of the Moon Sea, their eyes beneath the masks chilling and terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides that, their aura seemed somewhat chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they were top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, they were severely injured by the self-destructive attacks of the Ember Phoenix Clan's chief, deputy chief, and twenty elders, with blood at the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surviving already proves their strength is formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dark Phoenix's aura is gone," one of them said. His voice was hoarse, and his expression extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She entered deep space," the leading warrior said. "The Ember Phoenix Clan's deputy chief forcibly tore the space and threw Dark Phoenix into deep space, then used self-destruction to cover the spatial fluctuation, attempting to stop us from entering deep space to find Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, his eyes were filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're so naive. Do they think this will stop us from finding Dark Phoenix? It will only cost us a bit more time. Next, we&rsquo;ll enter deep space together and then split up to search."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dark Phoenix has yet to reach Empyrean Sacredness. She can't escape our hunt. Let's go." With that, he waved his hand, tore the space apart, and stepped in first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other nine quickly followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They soon appeared in deep space. Their power spread wildly, searching for Agatha's traces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leading warrior said, "Dark Phoenix is in this area. Let's split up and search."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the ten people searched in different directions. With their strength, their senses could instantly cover an immense area. Together, they could quickly search a vast region and find Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten were very confident about this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha was floating in a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her injuries were too severe. Without time to recover, her condition worsened. Eventually, as she entered deep space, she fell into the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence and instantly passed out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence wasn't strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, for Agatha, she could still endure it. She floated in the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, her body shrouded in a faint black energy, and her injuries were slowly healing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it would take her a long time to fully recover and wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'm afraid she would be discovered by the enemy long before that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a dilapidated purple palace was flying around in deep space, quickly approaching where Agatha was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, thinking, "Agatha is unconscious. But her position is moving quickly. Is it the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors leading her rapid escape? Or has she fallen into Chrono-Spatial Turbulence? Could she have already been captured by the enemy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I must find Agatha first. At least, her condition hasn't worsened and seems to be slowly recovering. This indicates that the self-destruction of the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors was effective." With that, Osborne directed the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to approach Agatha at an even faster speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The distance between them grew closer and closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed; he was already very close to Agatha. At this speed, he would see Agatha very soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, a terrifying force surged over, like a scanner, instantly sweeping through the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum itself had the ability to conceal its presence, and Osborne had the Sublime Concealment Orb. So that force seemed to detect nothing, merely mistaking the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for a rapidly drifting rock in deep space, paying it no mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That terrifying force continued sweeping forward, heading straight in Agatha's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. He thought, "This is bad. Such a terrifying force likely means the people trying to kill Agatha are already nearby, frantically searching for her. If they find Agatha first, everything will be over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was extremely anxious. But at this moment, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum had already reached its speed limit, and Osborne could only pray that the enemy wouldn't find Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the distance between Osborne and Agatha grew closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly activated Satan's Eye and looked toward Agatha's location.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne frowned deeply, looking extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was unconscious, floating in a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Beside her, a man wearing a black mask and exuding terrifying killing intent was staring down at her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
