  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade felt that there was no need to worry about Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, you're being too cautious, and that's not a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How would Osborne have the courage to show up at the Paltrow Estate? Do you really think he has the nerve to snatch your fianc&eacute;e at the wedding? He's not that foolish. No one willingly walks to their death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless he's a complete idiot, he wouldn't attempt something so clearly suicidal. He's the heir to the Augustine family, and he can't be a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have preemptively vanished, finding an excuse for not daring to come to the Paltrow Estate. It's all just an excuse to avoid humiliation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's face was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I being too cautious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander muttered, frowning. "I just don't want to leave anything to chance. Last time, when the Aberrants attacked the Augustine family's Maritime Auction, you said there wouldn't be any surprises, but in the end, they failed, and our family lost a Class A martial master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade responded awkwardly, "That was indeed my miscalculation. I didn't expect the Aberrants to fail. But that loss wasn't significant. It only delayed their return to Rosmandi by a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Aberrants will return to Rosmandi soon, and when they do, it will be a good opportunity for our family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Alexander. Under your leadership, our family will rise to its peak and become the most powerful ancient family in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he dares show up, we can easily take care of him. That would give us a legitimate reason to go after the Augustine family. We could even take over their cruise business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their cruise business is incredibly profitable, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes gleamed, and he sneered, "Don't worry. Even if Osborne doesn't show up, I'll take over the Augustine family's cruise business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their conversation, Alexander regained his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, I'll leave the arrangements for the inheritance ceremony and the wedding to you. Some of my classmates from Newport City will come to attend my inheritance ceremony and wedding. I need to attend to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Classmates from Newport City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they from the Power Prodigy Class?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's eyes lit up with excitement. "You must treat them well. Building good relations with them will be immensely beneficial for our family's future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander nodded. "I know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the study, Alexander quickly gathered some of his men and headed to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a private jet from Newport City touched down at Pinchide City Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's convoy drove straight onto the tarmac, parking and waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, several young figures emerged from the plane. The group consisted of three men and two women, led by a man in his thirties. He wore sunglasses, his expression haughty, exuding an aura of importance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the man, Alexander smiled and approached, adopting a somewhat deferential tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlie, it's been a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man addressed as Charlie returned the smile but kept his demeanor proud, almost dismissive. He shook Alexander's hand with an air of casual indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie Powell said coolly, "Alexander, so you've finally broken through to Class A Power Master. You're finally catching up to the rest of us. Congratulations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of the thirty-six members of our 25th Power Prodigy Class, you're the twenty-second to break through to Class A. You've moved up from the bottom to nearly the middle. Well done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie's words left Alexander's smile a bit stiff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was one of Alexander's classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a decade ago, Wade had pulled some strings to get Alexander into Newport City's prestigious Power Prodigy Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The class was filled with peers of Alexander's age, all of them prodigies in power or martial arts, each with a remarkable background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Alexander was very confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was born amidst omens, possessing a mutated Thunder Power with strength far surpassing his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Alexander was hailed as Dampston's greatest prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after joining the Power Prodigy Class, Alexander quickly learned that there were always greater talents. Every member of the class was his equal, if not stronger, with more powerful backgrounds and better resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During his time in the class, Alexander had consistently ranked near the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he tried, he could never break into the middle ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those experiences in the Power Prodigy Class were something Alexander loathed to discuss. He didn't want anyone to know how he had struggled at the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Charlie had casually brought it up. Alexander's face darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't dare show his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Charlie was ranked much higher than Alexander in the Power Prodigy Class, and most of the time, he could be in the middle of the stream. In terms of strength and talent, Charlie was more potent than Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, Charlie was a direct descendant of the ancient family of Newport City, the Powell family. In terms of strength, the Powell family was much stronger than the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlie, don't joke around. Compared to you, I still have a long way to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander turned his attention to the other four individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked to be in their mid-twenties, yet they exuded an extraordinary presence. Their gazes toward Alexander were tinged with the same sense of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlie, who are they?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
