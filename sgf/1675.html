However, </span><span>Dark Undead were independent</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>were like</span><span> mindless "weapons," requiring direct orders to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the command </span><span>was </span><span>issued to attack Diana, Dark Undead sprang into motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their speed was </span><span>very fast</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Dark Undead stood before Diana, moving so fast that even Osborne was taken aback. Being incorporeal, like a soul-state Deathborn, allowed for this incredible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Dark Undead was already comparable to a middle or late stage Deity Overlord warrior at full throttle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very impressive!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>was pretty satisfied</span><span>,</span><span> and he was eager to test </span><span>Dark Undead's </span><span>attack</span><span> and defens</span><span>e</span><span> stats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding her role in this test, Diana didn't </span><span>strike back</span><span> immediately. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she </span><span>only shielded</span><span> herself </span><span>with </span><span>divine power</span><span> and let those </span><span>Dark Undead</span><span> attack her at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumbling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Undead struck with fierce intensity, unleashing a barrage of dark energy that slammed against Diana's divine power defenses, </span><span>slightly affecting</span><span> her </span><span>shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the attacks were powerful, they</span><span> were still not able to break Diana's shield.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Diana still felt pretty surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a late-stage Deity Overlord, she</span><span> could fight</span><span> with two peak-stage Deathborns all on her own. Even </span><span>a </span><span>peak-stage Deathborn</span><span> could not </span><span>penetrate her divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this </span><span>Dark Undead</span><span> could make</span><span> her </span><span>shield</span><span> tremble. Its power was no insignificant feat. This indicated an attack strength roughly on par with a typical mid-stage Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Great</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> was satisfied with its attack power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's </span><span>try its defense power now</span><span>!" Osborne urged, thrilled by the display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Diana unleashed her attack. The Dark Undead, not a mindless creature, didn't just stand there and take it. It </span><span>smartly </span><span>dodged and attempted to counterattack, but the gap in their power was too vast. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few m</span><span>oments later, Dark Undead </span><span>was attacked by Diana and disappeared in </span><span>the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defense is a bit lacking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd say it</span><span>'s equal</span><span> to an early</span><span>-stage</span><span> Deity Overlord, but with impressive speed and dodging skills</span><span> </span><span>that surpass the typical early-stage Deity Overlord</span><span>'s</span><span>, even better than a standard mid-stage warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, I'd </span><span>say</span><span> Dark Undead is close to mid-stage Deity Overlord, just slightly weaker, though not by much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be thrilled by the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had upgraded Undead Cataclysm to Level Three, he could summon up to </span><span>1,000</span><span> Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thousand </span><span>Dark Undeads, all </span><span>with</span><span> mid-stage Deity Overlord</span><span>'s</span><span> strength</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span> thought, "If I use them</span><span> </span><span>to build a strong legion to attack enemies together...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they launched a coordinated attack, even peak Deity Overlords would struggle to withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana certainly wouldn't be able to </span><span>defeat them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I summon enough of them, that could really threaten a Deity King warrior</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "</span><span>My soul power is strong enough to ensure that the Dark Undead I summon is powerful</span><span> enough! </span><span>Their effects are right up there with my clones</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ecstatic over his newfound advantage, Osborne realized that Undead Cataclysm </span><span>granted him</span><span> another trump card. In crucial moments, it could provide a real shock to a Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's try </span><span>the </span><span>Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>cast the </span><span>Eclipse of Eternity</span><span> on Diana</span><span>. An engulfing darkness folded over Diana's area, shrouding her in a heavy veil of eternal night. Underneath this blanket of shadow, she couldn't see, hear, or feel anything. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was brace herself against the relentless and oppressive </span><span>tide </span><span>of dark energy washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard she </span><span>tried</span><span>, she found herself utterly trapped by the </span><span>darkness chains!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a mere ten seconds, Osborne </span><span>stopped casting</span><span> Eclipse of Eternity</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana was in a </span><span>mess</span><span>. As the darkness faded, she gasped for breath, and her eyes filled with shock and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was that technique?" she asked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "That was </span><span>the </span><span>Eclipse of Eternity! It's the same technique that Lord Malevolence used to wipe out ninety percent of Celestara's li</span><span>ves</span><span>. But trust me, I'm nowhere near his level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That technique! No wonder it's so terrifying. I felt despair as if the entire world had abandoned me. No matter how hard I fought, I couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone weaker than you caught in your Eclipse of Eternity wouldn't stand a chance of surviving."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her gaze shifted to Osborne, filled with awe and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power felt like an unfathomable abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Undead! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eclipse of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck her. "Wait a minute. Your dark elemental essence... Did you really just break through to Level Seven? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>It feels way more powerful than what I'd expect from a typical Level Seven elemental essence. Even Angelo, the Deity King, his mind control power didn't make me feel so hopeless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Maybe I'm just a bit special."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't</span><span> explain much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's </span><span>go ahead</span><span>! We've already wasted enough time here. We need to catch up with Angelo and the others."</span></p><div class="pagination">
