  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Zorro, who was acting as the referee, finally came to his senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened his mouth and finally announced, "Osborne wins and advances to the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, his face looked a bit unpleasant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he was a senior guard of the Royal Family. Seeing a member of the Royal Family lose, he also felt embarrassed. He had hosted countless Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels. Occasionally, princes and princesses of the Royal Family would join for fun, but they would always win every match and easily claim the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, everything seemed different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The competition to advance from the top twenty to the top ten had already held three matches. Two princes and princesses from the Royal Family participated, but they all lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Yunus was defeated by Osborne with a single arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After shooting an arrow, Osborne didn&rsquo;t even look at the result and directly turned to walk off the stage. It seemed he was certain that one arrow was enough to defeat Yunus. Yunus had nowhere to escape!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed Osborne's absolute confidence in his own strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was also a sign of contempt for Yunus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne succeeded. That arrow indeed defeated Yunus, even knocking him unconscious and off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, everyone watching froze&mdash;everyone except Zorro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew that after Yvonne's defeat, the Royal Family was eager to regain their lost face and dignity. They would undoubtedly go all out to defeat their opponent, absolutely not allowing another failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Yunus indeed did just that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave it his all in the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he lost even more miserably than Yvonne. Yunus's opponent was Osborne, who simply drew his bow, shot an arrow, and turned away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Yunus was defeated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's confidence and disdain felt like an enormous slap, harshly striking the faces of all the Royal Family members, leaving them utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus ranks fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the nine princes and princesses competing, his strength ranks fifth. Logically, he should be much stronger than ordinary contestants. Even against super dark horses like Leroy or Clara, he should have won.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Yunus lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he was defeated in a single move. Such a gap in strength left everyone shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Another super dark horse! And this one seems even more terrifying! With Prince Yunus's strength, even if he faced Princess Seraphina, who ranks first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, he should be able to hold out for a while, right? At the very least, he shouldn't be defeated in a single move!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, he was defeated in a single move by an ordinary contestant? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that Prince Yunus was too careless?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd started discussing again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those big figures became interested at this moment. But the Royal Family members looked gloomier. Many of them even couldn't help but stand up excitedly, their faces filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is contempt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That bastard turned around right after making his move! He's confident he can defeat Yunus in one strike!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many Royal Family members gnashed their teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Weston said coldly, "So what? He has that kind of strength. Is it not allowed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sit down. Do you think our Royal Family isn't embarrassed enough? This is a world where strength reigns supreme. The strong can indeed despise and humiliate the weak! Yunus is being despised and humiliated because he's not strong enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Weston finished speaking, no one could refute him. However, their expressions were all gloomy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But what now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yunus lost too! If no one makes it into the top ten, our Royal Family will become a joke! People from other factions are already mocking us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must do something to save our reputation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston sneered, "What to do? This is the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. On the stage, strength is what matters most! Whoever is stronger will win the championship! If you want to restore the Royal Family's reputation, then defeat your opponents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we supposed to intervene and stop them from winning?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Weston glanced in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "This guy's name sounds familiar! Didn't we once have a younger brother with the same name?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you talking about Osborne, who was banished from the Palace by our father eleven hundred years ago?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Naomi spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "I didn't expect you to still remember that useless younger brother! This person's name is indeed the same as that loser. However, our worthless brother has probably long died somewhere."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This person looks, feels, ages, and carries himself completely differently from that loser. They just share the same name."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, many people around began to recall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you talking about that illegitimate child? The one born to that lowly maid? He must have died long ago. It's been over a thousand years without any news. He probably perished in some corner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also still remember that illegitimate child."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That illegitimate child was just a coward. Stop talking about him, so it doesn't ruin everyone's mood! Let's focus on the current situation instead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three ordinary contestants have already made it into the top ten! This is a huge embarrassment for us, the Royal Family. Even if they are super dark horses, we absolutely cannot let them advance further into the top five!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If any of them makes it into the top five, we'll be even more humiliated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, stopping them from entering the top five won't be easy, especially Osborne! He defeated Yunus with just one arrow. His strength is terrifying! When we were at the same cultivation level, we weren't as strong as him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, the Sacred Artifact Osborne used is merely a Superior Sacred Artifact! The fact that he can unleash such terrifyingly powerful attacks with just a Superior Sacred Artifact shows how incredibly strong he is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among all the brothers and sisters participating, perhaps only the top three&mdash;Seraphina, Emiliano, and Matthew&mdash;might be able to defeat him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let them take action!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of princes communicated through Telepathy, thinking about how to prevent Osborne, Leroy, and Clara from advancing to the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far away, Callista was also thinking of a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The name Osborne alone makes me sick. And he's actually a super dark horse! Even though he's not that loser, I absolutely can't let him make it to the top five. Otherwise, the Royal Family's reputation will be completely ruined!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the strength he has shown is quite strong. How should I arrange the matchups to keep those three super dark horses out of the top five?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should I let Seraphina take action? With Seraphina's strength, defeating Osborne wouldn't be difficult! However, Seraphina is the strongest among them. Arranging for Seraphina to deal with Osborne might seem too deliberate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Matthew and Emiliano should also be able to defeat Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne uses a bow, so his close combat skills must be weak! In that case, let Matthew, who has the strongest close combat ability, take action!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Matthew's strength may not match Emiliano and Seraphina, but it's not far off! Plus, Matthew excels in close combat. He's the fastest, so he will definitely win!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, let Emiliano deal with Clara!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let Seraphina deal with... No, Seraphina can't move! Let Sean, ranked sixth in strength, deal with Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, it should ensure that none of the three can make it into the top five!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista sneered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
