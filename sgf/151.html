  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't find Raymond because a thick layer of soil limited his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one tunnel, he spotted several men in black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men in black were clearly different from the members of Hyena Gang. They were better equipped, just like the gunmen who had attacked the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was a man who was unarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became alert as he confirmed that Raymond was hiding in the underground tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, wait here for me. I'll go take a look. If something seems off, leave immediately and meet me at this location."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instructed Zoe, giving her the Institute of Human Research address, ready to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked worried. "Osborne, let me go with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle was inevitable, and he couldn't protect Zoe in that situation. He was confident that with his current power, even if he couldn't capture Raymond, he could still escape unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here. Wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne disappeared into the darkness and entered the territory of Hyena Gang. With his Satan's Eye, all the gang's security measures were nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He easily avoided several layers of security and arrived at the entrance of an underground tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance was in a room where four burly men were playing cards. To get through to the tunnel, he would inevitably alert them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, these men were just ordinary members of Hyena Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing outside the door, Osborne transformed his gaze into invisible fists, simultaneously striking each man on the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four men groaned and passed out without even realizing what had happened, and their bodies were quietly caught by Osborne's gaze, making no noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then opened the door and entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After moving the unconscious men to a corner, Osborne opened the hidden door to the underground tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These tunnels are used by Hyena Gang for smuggling drugs. There must be an exit that leads outside the city! I need to move quickly, or Raymond might escape through the tunnel to the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It will be harder to capture him then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he made up his mind, Osborne dashed into the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every few dozen feet, there was a lamp in the tunnel, all turned off. With Satan's Eye, Osborne could see as clearly as in daylight without needing to turn on any lights, moving through the passage like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he spotted some light in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, four fully armed elite gunmen and one werewolf were on guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must beat them quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, drawing the Draco Model H mini-handgun from his holster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, barely audible gunfire rang out, and the heads of the four gunmen burst into blood. They all fell dead instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining werewolf also hit in the head, wasn't killed. The bullet lodged in his face, and black blood flowed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared in shock and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized it was an ambush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the werewolf transformed, his face and arms sprouting thick black hair, appearing incredibly eerie in the dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His howl echoed down the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became glum. He hadn't expected the untransformed werewolf to have such strong defenses that a bullet to the head didn't kill him, allowing him to sound the alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I need to switch guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Draco Model H mini-handgun fires fast but its power is too weak. It's fine against humans but not against metahumans or martial artists. It doesn't pack enough punch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Osborne didn't stop moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged at the werewolf with a punch, his fist powered by Satan's Eye aiming for the newly transformed werewolf's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf sensed the threat and raised his furry arms in defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Osborne's fist crushed the werewolf's arm and slammed into his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf's head burst open like a watermelon. His formidable defense was nothing against Osborne's current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was startled by his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he even used the alloy dagger. He had difficulty piercing a werewolf's skin, and killing one was incredibly difficult. He would even sustain injuries himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his strength had far surpassed those days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same werewolf couldn't even block one of his punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Ambush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, cold voices echoed from deeper within the tunnel. The enemy had been alerted and was rapidly approaching, with continuous gunfire aimed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless bullets flew towards him from the depths of the tunnel, engulfing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least a dozen gunmen were shooting at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, about a dozen werewolves had completed their transformation, their eyes glowing crimson, ready to pounce and tear Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the tunnel, Osborne had nowhere to hide.</span></p><div class="pagination">
