  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the hundred-fold time acceleration, Osborne had spent over four years in secluded cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this grueling period, he finally managed to advance his cultivation from the Ascension Seven to the Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His command of the dark, space, and lightning elemental essences had also made remarkable headway. He'd moved from the mid-level of Level Ten to the late-level, just one step shy of reaching the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he'd infused several hundred Azure Ores into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow until it couldn't absorb any more of their energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could clearly sense the change; the bow had grown more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it hadn't yet evolved into a Sacred Artifact, it was incredibly close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe the next infusion would trigger that long-awaited transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he'd delved deeper into the Divine Ascendance Techniques he'd mastered. He'd dissected them and incorporated them into his archery skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Techniques such as Spatial Oblivion Slash, Dimensional Maw, Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Multi-Thunder </span><span>Chainstorm</span><span>, and Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent, along with Soul Spark Oblivion and the Nether Soul-seizing Slash, were now smoothly integrated into his archery. He could effortlessly unleash them using the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, deftly channeling Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of confidence; his strength had grown tremendously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to face Lord Malevolence now, he was certain he could take Lord Malevolence down with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the formidable Malevolence Tower, a top-tier Apex divine artifact protecting Lord Malevolence, wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, the power of just one of his casual arrows was enough to defeat an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad I still haven't managed to break through the absolute fusion of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! The Fusion Vessel has grown larger, but it still only has two fusion bases, limiting my ability to merge more power and enhance my Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, a hint of disappointment creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his efforts over the past four years to boost his Sacred Power, he had come up short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he sensed that the Fusion Vessel was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps soon, it would evolve, allowing for a third or even fourth fusion base, enabling him to merge even greater forces and strengthen his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time for the Sect Tournament!" he declared, shaking off the lingering thoughts of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped his training, stood up, and stretched, his joints cracking like firecrackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he stepped out of his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, Maddox was pacing anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, relief flooding his features, "Osborne, you're finally out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't come out soon, I would have barged in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow, piqued with curiosity. "What's going on? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox hurried to explain, "The Sect Tournament is about to kick off! I know how much this means to you, and I was afraid you'd miss it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Don't fret. I've got the date circled! Let's head over right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was in seclusion, the Mystic Sirius Sect had been abuzz with excitement, gearing up for the once-in-a-decade Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each tournament was a colossal affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It determined the top ten disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, who would then represent the sect in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City, vying for glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Mystic Sirius Sect, the tournament also signified fierce competition among the nine peaks. The better a peak performed, the more resources it would secure, giving it the edge in recruiting the cream of the crop first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, every peak took the tournament extremely seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was no exception, keeping a close eye on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the past two tournaments, not a single disciple from Peak Seven had managed to make it into the top </span><span>twenty</span><span>, let alone the top </span><span>ten</span><span>. This had been a major source of humiliation for her, which was why she'd mostly taken a backseat in overseeing matters this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as the tournament was fast approaching, Angela just couldn't hold back her curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela was seated at the head of the table, with a dozen Elders from Peak Seven on either side of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were locked on Earvin. "Earvin, the Sect Tournament is about to start. How's Peak Seven preparing? Show me the list of participants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin quickly stepped forward, presenting a scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, here's the list of contestants for you to take a look at!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela skimmed through the names in a flash, but her expression suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It darkened when she came across a particular entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, Mystic Sirius Sect, Peak Seven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also three other inner disciples on the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's annoyance reached a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? We've got over a hundred core disciples, all at Ascension Ten, and we can't even come up with thirty participants? Four inner disciples are going to compete in the Sect Tournament?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earvin's face dropped. He was well aware that the core disciples were reluctant to sign up, but there was precious little he could do to change the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowing his head, he kept quiet under Angela's probing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of helplessness washed over Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that Peak Seven was going to make a fool of themselves in this tournament yet again, probably repeating the dismal performance of the past two tournaments&mdash;no one in the top </span><span>twenty</span><span>, not even the top </span><span>ten</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of this potential failure bore heavily on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela finally said, waving her hand nonchalantly, "Never mind! The list has already been submitted, and there's no going back. Let's just hope someone can pull off a surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, Angela harbored little real hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew most of the inner disciples quite well, and although a few of them had some talent, they were no match for the disciples from the other eight peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Making it into the top twenty, let alone the top ten seemed like an insurmountable task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go and check out the situation!" Angela announced, leading the Elders of Peak Seven towards the arena where the tournament was set to take place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the arena, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect boasted over a million inner disciples and thousands of core disciples, and nearly all of them had gathered near the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the nine peaks, only the reigning champion, Peak One, had forty slots for participants, while the others were limited to thirty each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, 280 contestants were set to compete, almost all core disciples at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their formidable strength was palpable as they waited in their designated areas for the tournament to officially begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the crowd exclaimed, "Look over there! That's Bethan Tierney from Peak Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten years ago, she placed third in the Sect Tournament! She went on to represent Mystic Sirius Sect in the Tempest Fortress City </span><span>city</span><span> duel, making it into the top ten there and even competing in the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, she took a hard hit in the state duel, but she's determined to come back stronger this time and achieve an even better result!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's definitely improved since then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think she has a real shot at the top spot in this tournament!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement, pointing at the serene figure of Bethan, who was meditating with her eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A doubter scoffed, saying, "Pfft, aiming for first place? Fat chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She came in third last tournament, and I seriously doubt she'll break that streak this time. And don't forget, Jamar Bacall from Peak Three, who got second last time, and Vadim </span><span>Wilkens</span><span> from Peak One, the champion, have both leveled up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're </span><span>gonna</span><span> fight tooth and nail to keep their titles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's a safe bet those three will snag the top spots again. Anyone else trying to muscle in is just spinning their wheels!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold your horses, though! What if a dark-horse competitor shows up?" retorted someone.</span></p><div class="pagination">
