  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, on the western border of Celestara Planet, a fierce battle raged on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa and Lord Malevolence became ensnared within a cloak of pitch-black darkness. It was as if two malevolent black suns had materialized in the heavens. They collided with such ferocity that the very air around them quivered and trembled, as if protesting against the overwhelming force of their confrontation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force radiating from their conflict was so immense that even the slightest spillover was enough to shatter mountains and dry up rivers. At this moment, regardless of who they were or what their level of strength was, no one dared to approach the area where the two were engaged in battle. All they could do was watch from a safe distance, their hearts pounding with a mix of awe and trepidation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only structures in the vicinity were a magnificent black temple and two soaring towers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temple, of course, was the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and others&mdash;Anastasia, Zoe, and the like&mdash;watched the battle with bated breath, their faces pale with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Time stood off to the side, her gaze fixed intently on the fight, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle wore on for nearly half a day, it became painfully clear to Clarissa and the others that Isa was being thoroughly outmatched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence remained relaxed, while Isa struggled under the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Isa was only at Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence, on the other hand, was at Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Isa could hold her ground against someone like Lord Malevolence was impressive; it showed just how formidable she truly was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everyone knew it was only a matter of time before her defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do?!" Clarissa bit her lip in frustration. "Should we call on the Sanctum of Night for help? With its support, Isa would have a much better chance! Even if she can't defeat Lord Malevolence, she certainly wouldn't be overwhelmed!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shook her head firmly. "No way! If Isa needed the Sanctum of Night to help her fight, she would have summoned it by now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason she hasn't is that while she can control the Sanctum, Lord Malevolence can manipulate the Malevolence Tower, which is actually stronger than the Sanctum!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Isa tries to use the Sanctum, it'll just give Lord Malevolence an advantage with the Malevolence Tower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She might end up losing even faster!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Emma spoke, a heavy silence fell over the group. They gazed at the two imposing towers in the distance, their hearts sinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smaller tower was the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, while the larger one was the Malevolence Tower, the pinnacle of Apex divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand years ago, their respective sanctums had been shattered by the Malevolence Tower, with only the Sanctum of Night and the Sanctum of Light surviving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of power, the Malevolence Tower was the strongest Apex divine artifact on Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we really just going to sit here and watch Isa lose?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collective discomfort was palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that Isa's defeat would mean far more than just a lost duel&mdash;it would signify the downfall of the entire native Human Community on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, the Human Community would likely be slaughtered and enslaved by the Paramount Supreme Clan, stripped of any power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa exclaimed, "We can't do anything!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our strength, we're entirely outclassed in this kind of battle! Even if we teamed up, we'd be no match for a single attack from Lord Malevolence. We can't help Isa at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>More importantly, t</span><span>he moment we step in, those hired hands of Lord Malevolence&mdash;Ricky, Maddox, and the others&mdash;would jump in too! We'd be outmatched!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face reflected a deep despair; she truly couldn't see a way out of this situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she continued, "Right now, there's only one person who might be able to turn the tide!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?!" The group turned to Clarissa, their eyes filled with hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had a name in mind, but they wanted to hear it from her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's voice trembled with urgency. "God of Night!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the God of Night can change the tide of this battle! Look closely&mdash;Lord Malevolence hasn't even unleashed his full power; he's holding back! He's clearly wary of the situation around him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's probably worried that fighting Isa will drain too much of his energy, leaving him vulnerable to the God of Night's sudden appearance," she continued, her brow furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged worried glances, each of them realizing the truth in Clarissa's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when will the God of Night return? Can he really make it back in time?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia opened her mouth as if to speak, but the words caught in her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to mention that Osborne was likely on his way back too, and perhaps his return could also shift the balance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she thought about Lord Malevolence's Ascension Ten power and how Isa was struggling against him, the words fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her faith in Osborne, the overwhelming strength of Lord Malevolence loomed large in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King was terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a month ago, when Osborne left Celestara Planet, he was at the same level as us&mdash;an Ascension One Supernal Deity King. In just one month, how much could he have improved?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Two? Ascension Three?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be impressive, but any higher level is beyond imagination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he does reach a higher cultivation level, it won't matter much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between his power and Lord Malevolence's is simply too vast!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Osborne's ability to challenge those above his level, and his absolute forbidden zone to suppress his opponents, it won't be enough to match Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in cultivation is just too significant!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had unwavering faith in Osborne, she still didn't think his return could tip the scales of the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Anastasia felt a wave of despair wash over her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She silently prayed for Osborne to delay his return until the situation on Celestara Planet stabilized and the war came to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, he wouldn't have to face such danger!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the battle took a dramatic turn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a pained grunt as she was sent flying through the air, the dense darkness surrounding her dissipating to reveal her pale, bloodless face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, a stark contrast against her ashen complexion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps erupted from the crowd. Aside from Clarissa and her group, the rest of the Human Alliance watched in horror as Isa was struck down by Lord Malevolence, seemingly defeated. Fear gripped their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, you can't be hurt!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless members of the Human Community prayed silently for Isa, wishing they could lend her their strength to help her overcome Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, they were powerless to do anything but </span><span>pray</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's voice rang out, dripping with mockery. "Little girl! It's all over for you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad your teacher hasn't shown up yet. I expected him to make an appearance, which is why I've been holding back my strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, a cruel smile spreading across his face. "But now I'm disappointed! It seems your teacher really is in trouble and can't return. So, I won't wait any longer. I'm done wasting time with you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't show up, I'll just wipe you all out first!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've taken care of you, your teacher will be left all alone, unable to stir up any trouble..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Lord Malevolence bore down on Isa, a thick, almost tangible veil of murderous intent swirling around him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
