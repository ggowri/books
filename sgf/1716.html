  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really turned them to your side just like that? Do you think they'll actually trust us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was amazed by his ability to transform the guards into Blood Clan members, but she couldn't shake the feeling that such a quick "conversion" might be a gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. This is part of my unique ability. </span><span>They're trustworthy. Now we just need to wait for them to report back to Aldrich that you're dead and see if he still targets the Gellar family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah frowned. "Osborne, I appreciate your help, but your plan won't work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've told you. The Bowman family has my power signature! They possess top-tier Spirit Tracers. As long as I'm alive, they can track me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll just have to hide your power signature!" Osborne replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head vigorously. "That's impossible! You know my power is great at concealment, which is why I've managed to keep my identity hidden. But even so, I can't fool an Ultimate Spirit Tracer. The upper echelons of the Bowman family will see right through it with just one glance at the Spirit Tracer. They'll know I'm not dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled confidently, "Trust me, I have a way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he swiftly used the power of the Eclipsing Mantra to help Hannah conceal her energy signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a while, as long as you stay close to me, I can completely mask your power signature. Even if a Deity King warrior is nearby, they won't be able to detect you! No matter how powerful the Ultimate Spirit Tracer is, it won't pick up on your energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's mouth dropped open in astonishment. "Can it really work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel a strange energy enveloping her, completely cutting off her power signature from the outside world, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But doubt still nagged at her. "Can we really fool an Ultimate Spirit Tracer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, you don't need to worry. Osborne has everything under control! If you're still not convinced, let him show us firsthand," Anastasia chimed in with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show us firsthand?" Hannah asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and nodded. "Alright! Let's go see how the Bowman family plans to handle this situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he summoned spatial energy, and in an instant, Hannah, Anastasia, and the others were transported into a parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah gasped, finally understanding how Osborne had managed to arrive just in time to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also explained how he could appear before her mere minutes after being six million miles away at Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head back to Wild Flame City!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived back in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight Bowman guards still needed time to return, so Osborne planned to wait until they reported to Aldrich before moving everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They found themselves at Hannah's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next door was Spark of Blaze, where members like Betty and her two sisters, along with Darren, were deep in their training. Osborne chose not to disturb them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's facial features began to shift rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Osborne resembled his father, Theodore, in his youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I'll go by Theodore Augustine!" Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, seeing this, quickly transformed as well, taking on the appearance of </span><span>Osborne's mother, Vivienne, in her younger days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll be Vivienne from here on out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she wrapped her arms around Osborne's arm, a warm smile lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Hannah, everyone else in the group was already aware of Osborne's plan, so there were no surprised expressions among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Hannah looked back and forth between them, confused about what they were going to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hold back; he laid out his plan clearly for Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, she bit her lip, realization dawning on her. "I see! If I come out of this alive and the Gellar family stays out of trouble, I'll mobilize our resources to help you find your parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you won't die," Osborne assured her with a confident grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope you're right," Hannah replied, quickly shifting the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, with your strength, making a name for yourself in Celestara shouldn't be too hard, but getting everyone to know your name is another story. Celestara is huge, and many powerful Deity King warriors go unnoticed by the masses unless they pull off something truly spectacular!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent at her words, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bryce spoke up, "Is that really such a big deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just need to pull off something mind-blowing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne can't do it alone, then we'll do it together! I've got an idea that could really catapult us into the limelight in Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their attention to Bryce in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce, what kind of brilliant idea do you have?" Kendra asked, skepticism etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce crossed his arms, indignation flaring. "Why are you doubting me? This idea is nothing short of genius! Trust me, it'll get us noticed all over Celestara in no time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
