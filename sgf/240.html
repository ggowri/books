  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with excitement as he thought, "Zoe's power is becoming increasingly terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, it's the divine power! Even Class B+ metahumans can't resist the influence of Zoe's song. They're all under her control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated that the Chevalier family would lay a trap for him in the diamond mine, so he was well-prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His trump card was Zoe's psychic power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Isa, Zoe's psychic power was extraordinary, often described as divine power. It could bypass any power level differences and affect enemies regardless of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming to the diamond mine, Osborne had instructed Isa to hide outside with Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan was simple. When Osborne gave the signal, Zoe would start singing. Her voice was strong enough to permeate the entire diamond mine, affecting anyone who heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless their mental strength far surpassed Zoe's, they would inevitably be drawn into the melody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Derek and the other Class B+ metahumans were powerful, they were not psychic metahumans and thus were vulnerable to the song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were completely absorbed in Zoe's voice, unable to perceive anything outside their trance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the perfect opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He teleported in an instant and appeared right in front of the metahuman controlling </span><span>gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, this individual posed the greatest threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ability to control gravity severely limited Osborne's movements. If not for his dimensional rift ability, he would have been seriously injured by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This metahuman had to be dealt with first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's hands glowed fiercely with yellow Devil's Light as he delivered a powerful punch aimed at the gravity controller's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was still entranced by the song and didn't react to Osborne's attack until it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch landed with a resounding crash, but it didn't kill the gravity manipulator outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul of powers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class B and above metahumans had the soul of powers. When they face a life-threatening attack, this force erupted to shield them from a fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Class B+ metahumans, this defense was incredibly strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all his strength, Osborne couldn't break through it with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had anticipated this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready with a follow-up attack. The soul of powers could only block one attack, and once it faded, it couldn't protect against a second strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the soul of powers dissipated, Osborne's second punch came crashing through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity manipulator's head was crushed without a shred of doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class B+ metahuman who controlled gravity was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt no satisfaction. Without missing a beat, he opened a dimensional rift and slipped through, instantly reappearing behind the </span><span>second Class</span><span> B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one controlled the winds, complementing Derek's flames to enhance their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided he'd take him out next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the energy disturbance from Osborne's attack on the gravity metahuman jolted the wind controller out of his trance. He watched in shock as Osborne obliterated the gravity manipulator's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!" The wind controller shouted in disbelief, panic overtaking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to retreat, but Osborne had already moved through the dimensional rift and was now right behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attempt to retreat only brought him directly into Osborne's range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne unleashed his Devil's Light with full force, delivering a crushing punch straight to the wind controller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the soul of powers appeared in this person, but it could only withstand a single attack. Before it could react further, Osborne had already obliterated him with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>second Class</span><span> B+ metahuman was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Valentin and his team finally made their move. They had put on noise-canceling headphones in advance. Although the music's influence wasn't completely blocked out, it allowed them to regain their senses much faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone around them in disarray, they didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fire erupted from their hands, and countless bullets rained down on the enemies, mowing them down in waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne activated the Dimensional Space, and hundreds of battle robots and drones emerged, immediately beginning a relentless assault on the surrounding foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught of firepower was terrifying, causing massive casualties in seconds. Over half of the three hundred elite fighters Derek had arranged were obliterated before they even had a chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The survivors finally came to their senses, but the horrific scene around them left them paralyzed with fear. They scattered in every direction, fleeing in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Osborne faced off against the </span><span>third Class</span><span> B+ metahuman&mdash;the one who controlled ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice-controlling metahuman was now fully out of his daze. No longer being able to sneak attack, Osborne chose to confront him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly transformed into his Vampire form, boosting his strength. His blood-red hair lashed out like whips, binding the opponent tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a massive blood-red hole appeared in the metahuman's chest, and he collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the four Class B+ metahumans who had been attacking Osborne, only the severely wounded Derek remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek stared at Osborne in shock, his eyes filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
