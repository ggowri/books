  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he was referring to ordinary powerhouses who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for someone like Adriana, who had reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne was still no match for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was already terrifying enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne had just broken through to Empyrean Sacredness, his cultivation level only reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness, yet he was comparable to Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne would dare to think this way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I finally have the strength to take revenge now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne finally opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, most people had already completed their breakthroughs and were getting familiar with their surging power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who could participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel were the top geniuses and strongest individuals who had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness, and for them, breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness was no challenge at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they reached Empyrean Sacredness, they entered a special Enlightenment State, achieving significant improvements in all aspects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy had completed their breakthroughs, and both Clara and Leroy showed joyful expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like Osborne, they also had the illusion that they were already invincible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy had completed their breakthroughs, and both Clara and Leroy showed joyful expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only six princes and princesses had yet to complete their breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were already emanating the aura of Empyrean Sacredness, but their aura was still rising and surging. This situation left everyone else shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have special means to store power. They suppressed their cultivation level for hundreds of years, accumulating immense strength. Now, after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness, they are reclaiming that power, allowing them to grow even stronger, possibly even breaking through to mid Empyrean Sacredness!" someone said gravely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina, Prince Emiliano, Prince Matthew, Princess Rosalie, Prince Yunus, and Princess Jasmine are all using the same method to continue advancing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have they all broken through to mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, sensing the continuously surging aura of the six princes and princesses, everyone's expressions grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If all six princes and princesses advance to mid Empyrean Sacredness, the remaining fifty-plus people combined won't be their match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Clara and Leroy looked panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Osborne worriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy only advanced to primary Empyrean Sacredness. Although their strength surged, they weren't confident in dealing with Seraphina and the others who reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "Don't worry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "How could they not agree? We embarrassed the royal family in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, and they've long been displeased and wanting revenge. Now, they might all break through to mid Empyrean Sacredness. Perhaps when they wake up, the first ones they'll target are us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "It's fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did Seraphina and the other princes and princesses all break through to mid Empyrean Sacredness? So what? Osborne believed that even if he hadn't reached a new cultivation level, he could still handle them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he had now reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dealing with six people was simply too easy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponents were no longer Seraphina and the other princes and princesses but her brother Prince Hendrix, and even powerhouses like Weston and Quinn who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Seraphina and the other princes and princesses dared to go against Osborne after waking up, he would surely teach them a lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t tell Leroy and Clara that he had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, but he used the Sublime Concealment Orb to hide his aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The royal family's ultimate goal is to obtain the key to the Skyfall Casket in the Celestial Spire. If we want to get the key to the Skyfall Casket, we need to join forces to pass the trials. So, even if they all reach mid Empyrean Sacredness, they won't easily go against us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unless they get the key!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy sighed in relief after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a princess finally completed her breakthrough, and that was Jasmine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Jasmine ranked seventh on the power rankings, showcasing her immense strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power emanating from her was far stronger than before; she had already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She really reached mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was utterly shocked. Although Seraphina had long mentioned that the royal family had special methods to store the power gained while suppressing their cultivation level, then reclaim it after a breakthrough to directly reach mid Empyrean Sacredness, they were still stunned when it actually happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasmine had already broken through to mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aura of mid Empyrean Sacredness was far stronger than those who had reached primary Empyrean Sacredness. Only the auras of Clara and Leroy could barely compare to Jasmine in intensity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy's expressions grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. She's not your match." At this moment, Osborne's voice echoed in their minds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was observing Jasmine with Satan's Eye. Jasmine had indeed broken through to mid Empyrean Sacredness, and her strength had skyrocketed. If they truly fought, she would definitely not be a match for Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they had reached primary Empyrean Sacredness, before their breakthrough, they consumed a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir, making them much stronger than Jasmine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, even if Jasmine's cultivation level surpasses Clara and Leroy, they are still stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not just Jasmine, but Yunus, Rosalie, Matthew, and Emiliano had also completed their breakthroughs. Their auras were stabilized at mid Empyrean Sacredness, stronger than Jasmine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, even if their cultivation level is higher, they are no match for Clara or Leroy in a one-on-one fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally looked at Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Seraphina had not completed her breakthrough. Her aura was stronger than Emiliano's and Matthew's, and Osborne even felt that Seraphina's aura was pushing toward advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina ultimately failed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she was just a step away from reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness, her aura stabilized and stopped rising.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Seraphina opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bright light burst from her eyes, instantly making everyone around feel an overwhelming pressure. They didn't even dare to meet her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Seraphina's aura, everyone was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was so close to breaking through to advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Osborne, everyone was shocked. Even Clara and Leroy looked extremely serious, feeling immense pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was full of a radiant smile as she scanned everyone with sharp eyes. Finally, her gaze settled on Osborne's face, revealing a look of mockery and disdain in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what do you have to compete with me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, and I'm just a step away from advanced Empyrean Sacredness. My strength now is more than a hundred times greater than during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defeating you will be incredibly easy for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you have to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina proudly pointed at Osborne and said, "You're no longer worthy of being my opponent. If you can't help me pass the trial and obtain the Skyfall Casket's key, I can easily crush you right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she glanced at everyone else, ignoring Osborne entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I will be everyone's leader. Does anyone object?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
