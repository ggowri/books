  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sinister smile spread across Athena's face as she reveled in her newfound scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt she had found the perfect way to ensure Osborne's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, you want to take a half-month break? Not on my watch! I'll make sure you spend every moment of it gripped by fear and anxiety!" she laughed, a dark thrill coursing through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Athena sprang into action. Although she was just a leader of ten thousand and had to answer to many others at the Divine Peak Nine base, she had connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being a member of the Upper Race Soaring Lion Clan's Huntington family, she had an uncle named Edison, a brigadier general in the Wild Flame Army, who was a peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His position ranked second in the Wild Flame Army, and he had the authority to set missions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, with Edison's influence, a new mission was established.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a combined task that required exploration of the outer regions of Divine Peak Nine, along with mining in a designated Essence Crystal area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This particular mining zone was notorious; it was the same one where Celestial Crystals had been discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, a Deity King warrior had led a team of dozens of Deity Overlord warriors to extract Celestial Crystals, only to be met with a massive Deathborn assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outcome had been disastrous&mdash;nine Deity Overlord warriors perished, and the Deity King was severely injured, leaving only Diana and the Deity King to return alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of that fateful mission, Diana had earned the label of the cursed woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Athena and Edison were sending another team to explore the same treacherous area, but this time, there would be no Deity King warrior leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two individuals were specifically mandated to participate&mdash;Osborne and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other warriors could sign up if they wished, and anyone who joined the mission was guaranteed at least 30 thousand Merit Points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mission was set to commence in two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regardless of how many members were recruited, they would leave for Divine Peak Nine to explore the Celestial Crystal-rich mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thirty thousand Merit Points could be exchanged for three second-class merits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, such a task would attract throngs of eager participants, as exploration missions, despite their dangers, offered incredible rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they made it back alive, they would complete the mission and secure their points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plus, the chance of finding Celestial Crystals made it all the more enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the mission was announced, excitement rippled through the four major military districts. Many were eager to take on the challenge and test their luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when they saw that two participants had already been confirmed, their enthusiasm quickly fizzled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana&mdash;the cursed woman would be there, too. No one wanted to risk their necks alongside her. The whispers of her past failures hung in the air like a dark cloud, snuffing out any hope of glory for those who dared to dream of joining the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The cursed woman is going back to Divine Peak Nine for another mission? Is she out of her mind? That's just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Last time, she nearly got a Deity King warrior killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because of her, nine Deity Overlord warriors lost their lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard she was responsible for Emmett's death, too, along with a dozen other guards! Anyone who teams up with her is practically signing their own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm definitely not getting involved in any mission she's part of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone who isn't afraid of dying can go right ahead. I'm out of here&mdash;I want to live a little longer..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Count me out too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way am I going, no matter how many Merit Points are on the table!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And that Osborne fellow who's going with her? He's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone without Deity King-level strength who dares to accompany that cursed woman to Divine Peak Nine is just asking for it! Even Deity Kings end up injured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get out of here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the mission announcement, despite the enticing Merit Point rewards, no one stepped forward to volunteer. The fear of being dragged down by Diana, the so-called cursed woman, kept everyone at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This reaction was exactly what Athena had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're going to explore Divine Peak Nine with that cursed woman? I can't wait to see how you meet your end! You think you can outsmart me? You're not nearly clever enough! I've got countless ways to make your life a living hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Athena sent Osborne a message detailing the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She intended for him to spend the next two weeks living in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, when Osborne received Athena's message about the mission, his brow furrowed in irritation, a cold glint of menace flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Athena, you're playing with fire! Forcing me to team up with Diana to explore the Celestial Crystal mine at Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was well aware of the mine's notorious reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Deity King warrior had been gravely injured there, and nine Deity Overlord warriors had perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was a storm cloud of frustration. "I was planning to wait until I was stronger before exploring Divine Peak Nine with Diana, but now, thanks to Athena, I have no choice but to move up the timeline..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
