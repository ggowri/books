  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that a person's cells regenerate every seven years, and many emotions seemed to reach their breaking point around that time as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Ophelia had spent seven years together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many seven-year cycles could one have in a lifetime?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had given the most precious seven years of his life to Ophelia. If she hadn't hurt him so deeply, how could he have become so ruthless towards her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Caldwell Tower, Ophelia had ordered the guards to beat him. His head had been struck with the butt of a gun, leaving him bleeding profusely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Caldwell Manor, Ophelia even had her bodyguards point him with a gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had secretly vowed that one day, he would make Ophelia repent, and he would ensure that everyone in the Caldwell family regretted treating him so cruelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he finally became a powerful man, he suddenly didn't want to do it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he truly let go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Osborne really moved on from the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe, deep down, Osborne still harbored some feelings for Ophelia, and those feelings kept him from wanting to continue humiliating or tormenting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had shared seven years together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories from the past kept flashing through Osborne's mind, making it impossible for him to focus on his cultivation. Frustrated, he stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a blank expression, he pushed open the door and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where are you going?" Yulissa stood up from the sofa, asking with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and said, "I'm going to the deck to get some fresh air."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the words had fully left his lips, he was already out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of heading to the deck, he took the elevator to the seventh floor of the cruise ship, walking towards Isa's cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Evelyn was standing outside Isa's door, quietly sobbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the door to Isa's cabin remained firmly shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Evelyn had already pleaded with Isa, only to be refused. Refusing to leave, she continued to wait outside, hoping Isa might change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't realize was that Isa was known as the "Night Witch".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with a nickname like </span><span>Witch</span><span>, how could Isa care about Evelyn? How could she be concerned about Ophelia?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Isa had already refused, even if Evelyn waited here forever, she would not change her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn's voice was hoarse from crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing footsteps, she looked up to see Osborne and her despair was briefly transformed into hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw Osborne's cold expression, her hope turned back into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Osborne must have come to mock her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move," Osborne said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn flinched. The coldness in Osborne's voice made her uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she shifted aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood before the door, took a deep breath, and knocked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa opened the door, her gaze icy as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't tell me you've gone soft?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth but couldn't find the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "Have you forgotten what you went through those three years? Have you forgotten how they treated you? Have you forgotten how they humiliated you, tortured you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth again but still didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't forgotten," he finally said, his voice dripping with helplessness. He wanted to forget, but he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could forget, maybe he could be more ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Isa's cold expression and said apologetically, "I'm sorry, Isa, for disappointing you. But no matter what, she got hurt on the Augustine family's cruise. I should try to save her, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scoffed in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fool yourself. You've gone soft! Do you really believe what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want me to save her? Are you certain you won't regret this later? Let me tell you, some people can never change! Although they're apologizing and bowing to you now, it's not because they truly regret what they did. It's because you're stronger than them now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're trying to curry favor with you. Right now, you're so powerful that they see losing you as a mistake, so they're trying to win you back and apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you ever fall, or if their status rises above yours again, they'll humiliate you, despise you, and trample you without a second thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's human nature!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you want me to save her? Are you sure you won't regret it later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words hit Osborne like a sledgehammer, his face growing increasingly grim as an internal struggle raged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he looked up at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, I don't know if I'll regret this later, but risking one chance to test someone's true nature is worthy, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried to sound calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "Fine, as long as you don't regret it. Just don't come crying to me later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne forced a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. I may be a doctor, but it's been a while since I saved anyone. It might be good to refresh my skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa started walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn, overcome with emotion, bowed deeply to Osborne in gratitude before quickly following Isa.</span></p><div class="pagination">
