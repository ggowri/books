  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you prove it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley asked coldly, "You chose a place without surveillance, after all. You are not stupid enough to attempt something like this where cameras could catch you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked at Osborne with disdain, clearly not believing he could prove his own innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne simply smiled. "It is simple. I will have them tell the truth themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pointed at Blake and Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's scorn deepened. "Have them tell the truth? They have already said you tried </span><span>to molest and rape her, and Blake caught you in the act, which is why you wanted to kill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "What they said before might not be true. But I have a way to make sure what they say next is the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley sneered, "Why would what they said before be a lie, and what they say next be the truth? Are you planning to threaten them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly pulled out a bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a bottle of truth serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had bought it for five million dollars a long time ago to deal with Davy of the Maelstrom and Raymond of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still three doses left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He displayed the bottle to the crowd. "For those who know, this is a product of the Draco Group&mdash;truth serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once taken, it induces a trance-like state where the person will truthfully answer any question asked without lying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Wesley turned uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in surprise, and many of them looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is really truth serum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have heard of it. It is a product of the Draco Group's lab, rarely available on the market. Even professionally trained agents cannot resist its effects and will reveal all their secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this is indeed the Draco Group's truth serum, it can definitely get the truth out of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked even more distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He angrily retorted, "How do we know it is truth serum and not poison? You might be trying to silence them! Once they are dead, no one can testify against you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are my guests. I would not allow you to use drugs on them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Wesley signaled his bodyguards, but Osborne laughed coldly. "Wesley, do you think I am asking for your permission? Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am proving my innocence. If you have the guts, try to stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne approached Blake and Ava, who were pale with fear. They knew they could not afford to take the truth serum, as it would expose all their secrets and schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only look at Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face was livid with anger as he gritted his teeth and said, "Osborne, you are too arrogant! Today is my wedding, this is my turf, and I would not allow you to act out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who dares!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Clarissa coldly shouted, "They slandered Osborne, and now he wants to prove his innocence. I dare anyone to stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to stop him will be making an enemy of the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Clarissa finished speaking, several bodyguards from the Radcliffe family appeared, staring coldly at the Ashford family's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the Ashford family's bodyguards felt a chill run down their spines and did not dare to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley clenched his fists, feeling extremely frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored him and walked up to Blake, who was screaming in pain. Grabbing his jaw, Osborne forced the truth serum into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then did the same to Ava, making her swallow the truth serum as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were ordinary people and could not resist the powerful effects of the truth serum. Soon, their eyes became vacant and unfocused, like walking corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly at the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I will begin asking questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Ava. "Ava, tell everyone, did I try to molest you? Did I attempt to rape you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava looked dazed, but immediately replied, "No! Blake told me to seduce you. He promised to pay me a lot if I succeeded. I waited here to try and get you to sleep with me and take a video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you called me ugly and pushed me away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the crowd burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Ava was far from ugly. If she were, Blake would not have sent her to seduce Osborne. She was also quite attractive, with a voluptuous figure that many men found very enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, whether or not Ava was considered beautiful depended on who she was compared to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was compared to Clarissa, Ava fell far short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne's girlfriend was Clarissa, it made sense that he would reject Ava.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ava continued, "When I failed to seduce you, Blake changed the plan. He told me to tear my clothes and pretend you molested me, then scream rape to frame you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did everything under Blake's orders."</span></p><div class="pagination">
