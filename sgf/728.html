  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that Osborne had snagged the top spot in the heir selection process, which meant he was set to become the first heir of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His authority would soon surpass that of most elders, granting him a slew of privileges within the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Owen had only managed to secure fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules, he was no longer even a potential heir, leaving him with no privileges whatsoever in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Owen dared to provoke Osborne, he could easily find himself tossed into the dungeon, and no one would bat an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was well aware of this, so he kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't quell his resentment; if anything, it only fueled his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent said, his voice dripping with disdain, "Is this how it's going to be? Bullying with your newfound power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen might be scared of you, but I'm not! I'm here to challenge you, Osborne! I'm going to show everyone that you don't deserve to be number one; you're just lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you brave enough to take me on? If you're too chicken, just lock me up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent shot a provocative look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to respond, a graceful figure stepped forward, blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, if you want a challenge, why not take me on instead? After all, you're fifth, and I'm second. If you can't even beat me, what gives you the right to challenge Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not satisfied, then fight me first. If you win, then you can go after Osborne," Emma said, her tone dripping with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's expression darkened at her words. "Emma, you've got some nerve challenging me! I'll admit you've got talent, but do you really think you're my equal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled, "You won't know until we fight. It's not just about talk! I think it's time to pass on that 'strongest of the younger generation' title you're holding onto."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent gritted his teeth. "Fine! If you're looking for trouble, I'll gladly oblige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's settle this! Once I beat you, I'll go straight for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll show everyone that you two are nothing compared to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vincent stormed off toward the training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you both!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he left, the crowd erupted in chatter. Concerned murmurs surrounded Emma as people gathered around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, why did you step in? This is between Vincent and Osborne! You're still young, and we all believe you'll surpass Vincent one day, but it's too soon for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent is the only Class AAA among the younger generation. His strength ranks high even among the elders. You can't take him on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, you're being reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their warnings, Emma waved her hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I respect Osborne's first place, so why shouldn't they? If they can't accept it, I'll make them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who says I can't take Vincent on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma shot a quick glance at Osborne, her eyes softening for a moment before she turned and made her way to the training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the training ground was packed with spectators, all eyes on Vincent and Emma as they prepared to face off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? Why are they fighting? There's a huge age gap between them! Even if Emma is the most talented in the Augustine family, she can't possibly match Vincent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, if she can hold her ground for five moves, that'll be impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent sneered at Emma, his confidence unwavering. "Go ahead, Emma! I won't say I'm picking on you&mdash;I'll even let you have three free shots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma raised an eyebrow at the comment, choosing not to respond verbally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she unleashed her power, casually casting Freeze power on Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Vincent was encased in a massive block of ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class AAA! That's the aura of a Class AAA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did Emma break through to Class AAA? She was only Class AA yesterday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, she's barely twenty-five and already at Class AAA? Truly the most talented in the Augustine family. Vincent was close to forty when he reached Class AAA, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, this fight just got interesting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the uproar from the crowd, the battle continued unabated. Vincent's power surged as he managed to break free from Emma's Freeze power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could say anything, Emma waved her hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freeze!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was frozen once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smirked. "It took you this long just to break my Freeze power. And you think you can challenge Osborne? What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give up already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma unleashed a Psychic Blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense psychic assault penetrated Vincent's mind. As Vincent came out of the ice, he coughed up blood, his face pale and clearly injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit defeat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
