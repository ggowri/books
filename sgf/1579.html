  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sudden, intriguing idea sparked in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Aether Hawks Clan and Fero Tiger Clan are both powerful forces in Wild Flame City, second only to the three Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Saxton family is the strongest within the Aether Hawks Clan, while the Borden family holds the same position in the Fero Tiger Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although there's a slight gap in their strength, it's negligible&mdash;there's no significant hierarchy between them. So why not incite a conflict between the Saxton family and the Borden family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they clash, even erupting into a fierce battle, it would throw Wild Flame City into chaos. Not only would it drain their resources, but it would also divert the attention of all the major factions away from Spark of Blaze."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought excited him, and Guy, upon hearing Osborne's plan, showed no signs of dissent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though he still officially belonged to the Borden family, his loyalty to Osborne was absolute. He would follow Osborne's orders without hesitation, even if it meant betraying his own family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord, leave this to me!" Guy declared, nodding confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, a glint of cold determination in his eyes. "Herman, is it? You want your son to steal my chance at promotion? Just turning him into a Blood Clan member won't be enough. I'll make sure to hit you where it hurts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne settled back, waiting patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't long before someone arrived to report to Guy that a certain Donald had come to check in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Accompanying him was a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he heard the name of the middle-aged man, Guy frowned. He quickly turned to Osborne. "My Lord, the man accompanying Donald is Murray Whitehead, one of Herman's trusted aides. He's also at the early Deity Overlord level and likely stronger than me. He's a leader of ten thousand. Do you think he'll interfere with our plans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "An early Deity Overlord, stronger than you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That could indeed complicate things! But don't worry; since he's here, let's turn him into a Blood Clan member, too! That might actually make our plans run smoother. We just need to be careful&mdash;make sure he doesn't escape or leak any information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll have Bruno and the others come over. If anything goes sideways, they'll jump in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy exhaled, visibly relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two quickly strategized, and soon enough, Murray and Donald arrived outside Guy's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in!" Guy called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both men entered with an air of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald, though still just a centurion and two ranks below Guy, didn't show much deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his father was Herman, a general in the Wild Flame Army and Guy's superior's superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard for Donald to treat Guy with much respect under those circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, he wasn't overly arrogant. He greeted Guy with a nod, his tone flat as he said, "Mr. Guy Borden, I'm here to report in. I'll be under your command for a while, so I hope you'll look out for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words were polite enough, and under normal circumstances, Guy wouldn't have been bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Herman's position did place him above Guy. It wouldn't be wise to take offense at Donald's demeanor, as that could provoke Herman's ire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Guy's face darkened, and he said coldly, "Donald, what's your attitude? You're just a centurion, while I'm the leader of ten thousand! If you're here to report in, show some respect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His harsh words left Donald stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but frown, his annoyance mounting as he glanced at Murray beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray, too, was looking at Guy with a mix of surprise and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Murray's mind, Guy had always been a smooth operator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Guy knew Donald's background, why would Guy treat him like this? It just didn't make sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, by reprimanding Donald, Guy was essentially slapping Murray in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Murray had been ordered by Herman to escort Donald and bolster his presence, serving as a warning to others not to mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Guy had openly berated Donald, which felt like a direct insult to Murray's mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's face grew grim, and he said coolly, "Mr. Guy Borden, is this really necessary? Mr. Donald Saxton is here to report in, and he did show you respect. If General Herman Saxton finds out about this, it won't be pretty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you should apologize to Mr. Donald Saxton to avoid scaring him off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's gaze was threatening as he finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed he had made his point clear, even invoking Herman's name, which should have shaken Guy into compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Guy only grew angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Murray, who the hell do you think you are? You don't have a say here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
