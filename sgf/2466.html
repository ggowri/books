  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After</span><span> announc</span><span>ing</span><span> Leroy's score</span><span>,</span><span> Ian</span><span> </span><span>subtly glanced at Osborne and Leroy with a flattering look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered inwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Leroy's gain didn&rsquo;t reach three billion; she had calculated it before&mdash;it should be over 2.8 billion, but less than 2.9 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Ian directly rounded up Leroy's score, adding over 100 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to her. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To put it in perspective</span><span>, Dustin, who ranks third now, has only </span><span>accumulated</span><span> 64 million</span><span> in total</span><span>. The points Ian casually </span><span>tacked onto</span><span> to Leroy are twice Dustin's total gain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The message was obvious&mdash;he was trying to curry favor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was truly scared. He wanted to please Osborne, hoping Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t expose his secret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also looked at Osborne in shock. Earlier, she thought she was doomed. Insulting Ian, a member of the Royal Family, meant no one could save her. Even her Sect, family, and friends would suffer because of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was filled with regret and despair...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stepped forward to comfort her, telling her not to be afraid and promising to protect her from Ian's revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Leroy didn&rsquo;t believe it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she knew Osborne&rsquo;s background very well. Osborne was merely a disciple of the Second-rate Power Mystic Sirius Sect. In terms of status and background, Osborne was even inferior to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Osborne possibly protect her?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could Osborne possibly stop Ian, a Royal Family member, from taking revenge on her?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was simply impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what happened felt like a dream to her. Osborne invoked the laws and ancestral teachings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, reprimanding Ian, leaving him unable to argue back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that time, Leroy could still clearly feel that Ian's anger toward her hadn't subsided and was still filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But later, Osborne and Ian locked eyes, as if they were communicating telepathically...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Leroy felt all of Ian's killing intent toward her vanish. Not only was there no more hostility, but his gaze carried a hint of apprehension and fear, and even a trace of...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flattery?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy thought she had felt it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Ian calculated her score next, he directly added over a hundred million to her gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was blatant flattery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy stood frozen on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why was Ian </span><span>trying to win</span><span> her</span><span> over</span><span>? She had insulted </span><span>him</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only reason could be...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy couldn't figure out what Osborne had said to Ian</span><span>. It</span><span> not only made Ian lose his intent to kill her but also </span><span>eager to please her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Leroy was immensely grateful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her eyes, Osborne's already tall, majestic, and mysterious figure became even more enigmatic, like an endless abyss </span><span>that draws her in</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip, staring blankly at Osborne's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Brenda was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up at the leaderboard, seeing her name no longer at the top. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Above it, Leroy's name appeared, so dazzling, stealing all the glory that should have been hers...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those three billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were almost four times hers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep in her eyes, there was anger. She couldn't accept </span><span>this. She was not</span><span> the champion</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>She had been</span><span> overshadowed by Leroy</span><span>?</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's strength was definitely the weakest among all the contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Leroy the champion? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sh</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e must have cheated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as she was about to speak again, she suddenly felt an incredibly cold gaze locking onto her. She looked over and found it was Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was staring at her with a threatening look, as if saying...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you dare say one more word, I'll deal with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda trembled, not daring to meet Ian's icy gaze. The words that were already on the tip of her tongue were swallowed back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was unwilling, she was angry, but she didn't dare to vent her anger at Ian. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As</span><span> a disciple of Skyearth Dominion</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>she did not need to</span><span> flatter or pleas</span><span>e</span><span> Ian, but offending him would bring big trouble. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Skyearth Dominion might not be able to protect her, nor would they necessarily be willing to offend Ian for her sake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Luckily, I'm still second place!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda bit her lip tightly, stubbornly thinking that Leroy's </span><span>victory</span><span> was just a</span><span> fluke</span><span>. She believed the Sect wouldn't blame her for not winning the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yes, Leroy is just a lucky champion! The real champion </span><span style="font-style: italic;">in terms </span><span style="font-style: italic;">of strength is me, Brenda!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her credit, </span><span>Brenda</span><span> </span><span>adjusted herself </span><span>quickly. Her ability to rationalize was top-tier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly calmed her mindset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as I get second place, I'm still the most dazzling one! Everyone knows Leroy is just lucky! With her ability, she's not even qualified to be compared to me! That's right!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's </span><span>arrogance and confidence rekindled</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, on Racial Convergence Planet, billions of spectators from Crescentia were utterly shocked; Leroy's </span><span>gains</span><span> left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, they could only see the projection </span><span>but</span><span> hear no sound, so they had no idea what had happened. They didn&rsquo;t know Leroy's score was almost </span><span>wiped out</span><span> by Ian, nor did they know Leroy nearly got into big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only saw Leroy's name appear at the top of the leaderboard, surpassing Brenda to become number one!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud uproar erupted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the ones with the worst expressions were the people from Skyearth Dominion. They had previously thought Brenda's championship was secured and had been cheering arrogantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, they felt as if they had been slapped in the face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person who had been mocked by the Skyearth Dominion crowd earlier now burst into hearty laughter, looking at them with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Skyearth Dominion trash, weren't you all so arrogant just now? Didn't you say the championship was already </span><span>in the bag</span><span>? How come it's just second place now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Champion Leroy's gains are almost four times Brenda's!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my opinion, your Skyearth Dominion's Brenda might not even get second place in the end! After all, there are still two people whose scores haven't been tallied yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that person finished speaking, the faces of the Skyearth Dominion crowd turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, facing the mockery, they had no way to refute and could only grit their teeth and pretend </span><span>that they had not heard a thing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Clarke, this is just an accident! That Leroy was just lucky. Your disciple Brenda has already performed well enough! In terms of strength, she is the true champion of the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yale Clarke's face was grim. He was Brenda's </span><span>master</span><span>, the one who infused power into the Ice Scepter and handed it to Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought Brenda would win the championship, but she ended up being overshadowed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was extremely angry at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he quickly composed himself and said calmly, "Don't worry, I know what's going on, and so does everyone else! Leroy just got lucky... Brenda </span><span>secured the</span><span> second place with her </span><span>sheer </span><span>skills</span><span>. This</span><span> is already impressive..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yale was speaking when he suddenly heard a burst of exclamations from the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yale quickly looked up at the projection screen. When he saw it clearly, he instantly felt his vision go dark, rage surging </span><span>through his veins</span><span>, almost causing him to pass out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exclaimed, "How could this happen?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
