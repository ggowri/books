  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and his companions launched a coordinated attack, but they were utterly unable to withstand Joseph's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Joseph was holding back; he didn't want to kill them outright. Instead, he sought to extract the secret behind how the Augustine family could mass-produce members with Divine Bodies of Level Three or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Joseph unleashed his full power, even if Sebastian and his team survived, they would be left severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it stood, the ten of them were already spitting blood and being sent flying with each strike. The Ethereal Glow they relied on for defense was no match for Joseph's ferocity, and their Divine Bodies bore numerous wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, their Divine Bodies were robust, and they were healing at a visible rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be long before they were back on their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this only fueled Joseph's anger and intensified his desire to uncover the Augustine family's secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He himself possessed a Level Three Divine Body and knew all too well how formidable they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel Clan could obtain the secret to producing Level Three Divine Bodies </span><span>en</span><span> masse, their power would skyrocket in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could surpass their previous peak and become one of the most powerful divine clans in existence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed flickered in Joseph's eyes as he looked down at Sebastian and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That secret is as good as mine! Surrender and submit to the Deschanel Clan, and I promise you'll all live! Don't push me to kill a few of you. With just ten of you, do you really think you can challenge me? You have no idea how vast the gap is between a Junior Deity and a Superior Deity! Even if you had twenty or thirty, I could take you all on with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph wore a smug grin, reveling in his superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian wiped the blood from his lips and retorted, "Twenty? Thirty not enough? How about fifty?! Come on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, Sebastian signaled, and suddenly, forty hidden members of the Augustine family emerged from the shadows, swiftly surrounding Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty Junior Deities? Damn it! How on earth does the Augustine family have fifty Junior Deities? And all of them at least Level Three Divine Bodies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned, but excitement and greed surged within him even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can crush the Augustine family and force them to submit to the Deschanel Clan, I'll be the one to uncover that secret! Just think of the glory! The clan leader will reward me handsomely and elevate my status!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Joseph abandoned the idea of calling for reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to subdue the Augustine family on his own and claim all the glory for himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though facing fifty Junior Deities was daunting, he was confident in his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was at the pinnacle of Superior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if there are fifty of you? I can take you all on by myself!" he boasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled coldly, "Is that so? Then let's see you try!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can force the Augustine family to bow down? Not a chance! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Sebastian sprang into action, and the other forty-nine Junior Deities from the Augustine family wasted no time joining him in a fierce assault on Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that all fifty of them were only Junior Deities, the combined strength of their attack was enough to make even him cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Ethereal Glow flared to life, enveloping him in a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? And keep your precious secret safe? Ha! You're dreaming! You'll never manage it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph had no choice but to unleash his full power, ready to face the oncoming storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If fifty average Junior Deities had surrounded him, Joseph was confident he could handle the situation or at least make a swift retreat without worrying about being overpowered, let alone killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fifty Junior Deities before him were no ordinary bunch; each possessed at least a Level Three Divine Body, with several boasting Level Four Divine Bodies and Sebastian himself wielding a Level Five Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collective strength far outstripped that of typical Junior Deities by several times or even a dozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's might was already nearing that of an Intermediate Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Joseph, with all his pride, had to approach this with caution, pouring all his effort into the battle. Had it not been for the tantalizing potential reward of uncovering the Augustine family's secret, he would have sought help long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, however, Joseph found himself regretting that decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized, all too late that he was outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined might of fifty such formidable beings far exceeded his expectations. In mere moments, his Ethereal Glow was nearly shattered, his defenses crumbling under the relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Joseph's own attacks were effortlessly thwarted by Sebastian and his comrades, leaving him in a desperate defensive stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face twisted in dismay. The sheer mass and power of his opponents had reached a critical threshold, even for a Superior Deity at his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found himself with few opportunities to strike back. Any hope of calling for help had evaporated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, his face a mask of cold determination, barked out the order, "Kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let up; don't give him any chance to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their attacks intensified with a relentless wave of fury that left Joseph scrambling just to stay alive.</span></p><div class="pagination">
