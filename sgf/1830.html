  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne led Darren into the conference room of their base, where Anastasia, Zoe, and the others soon joined them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's with the serious vibe? If you've got something to share, just let us know!" Anastasia remarked, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled subtly, "I've been doing a lot of thinking last night, and I've figured out our direction for the foreseeable future. I wanted to share it with you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the atmosphere shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone became serious, their eyes fixed on him, knowing that what he was about to say would shape their next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm planning to establish a visible force here in Apocalypse City. Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion could launch a full-scale assault on the Human Community at any moment. With our current strength, it would be nearly impossible to withstand such an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to contribute something to the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, having an official force will make things easier for us. Only a Dukedom Level Power can gain access to the Sanctum of Light and meet the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without a backing force, we won't even get an audience with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they might not see the immediate significance of forming an official power, they trusted Osborne's judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Beyond that, I want everyone to know that the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' are here! We've been working hard in the East Zone to make our names known, and my ultimate goal is to find my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're still alive, they might have heard of the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.' I want them to know I'm here in Apocalypse City, hoping they'll come to find me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the group nodded, their expressions resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're behind you all the way! Just tell us how we can support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a warm sense of camaraderie wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was comforting to know that no matter what he chose to do, they were willing to back him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Since everyone's on board, it's settled then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll name our force the 'Pioneers of Starlight,' with the nominal leader being the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' and Darren as the vice-leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our main focus will still be on training and strengthening our abilities. I'll leave the day-to-day operations of the Pioneers of Starlight to Darren."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Darren, Osborne said, "What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren nodded earnestly. "My Lord, you can count on me! I'll handle it! But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what?" Osborne prompted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just that we wiped out the Radiant Era Syndicate yesterday, and we also took down Bryan Quigley's son, Isaiah Quigley, from the Falcon Alliance. They're likely to retaliate against us! With our current strength, facing the Falcon Alliance's revenge might be tough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Falcon Alliance is just a first-rate force in Apocalypse City, right? Are they really that strong? Can't the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' and the Blood Demon members stand up to them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren replied, "My Lord, the Falcon Alliance is formidable, but with you leading us, we shouldn't fear them! The real issue is that the Falcon Alliance is backed by the Baxter family. The Baxter family is a Dukedom Level Power, and they have a Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, his face a mix of confusion and intrigue, "A Supernal Deity King?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is a Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others mirrored his bewilderment, having never heard of such a title before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly explained, "A Supernal Deity King is a warrior who has surpassed the peak of the Deity King realm. However, they are still classified as Deity Kings! Figures like Lord Malevolence, the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings, and the Nine Dark Sovereigns under Lord Malevolence are all considered Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;top-tier among them, in fact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't tell you exactly how they rank; I've never heard it explained. It seems like Supernal Deity Kings never disclose those details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But one thing's certain, Supernal Deity Kings are incredibly powerful, far stronger than even the best Deity Kings. For a force to achieve Dukedom Level Power, it must have a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why Dukedom Level Powers can access the Sanctum of Light&mdash;they have Supernal Deity Kings! So, naturally, the Baxter family has at least one Supernal Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, once you surpass the peak of Deity King, you become a Supernal Deity King? That's fascinating! Could you break down how the power levels work within the various factions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren nodded eagerly, ready to clarify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The factions of the Human Community in the West Zone are categorized into five levels, ranked from weakest to strongest, Third-rate Powers, Second-rate Powers, First-rate Powers, Dukedom Level Powers, and the most powerful, Sanctum Level Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any group without a Deity King warrior is classified as a Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they have at least one Deity King warrior, that's considered a Second-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they boast at least ten peak Deity Kings, they move up to First-rate status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To become a Dukedom Level Power, a force must have at least one Supernal Deity King and more than a hundred peak Deity Kings to boot!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
