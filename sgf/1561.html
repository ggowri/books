  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy and Bruno spent a long time discussing their plans, unaware that Osborne had been quietly eavesdropping on every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he listened, a cold, steely resolve settled in his gaze as he fixated on Guy and Bruno in the office, a murderous intent simmering beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had no idea that their meticulously crafted scheme had already been completely exposed before it even began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, when their conversation came to an end, the divine power cloaking the office dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne seized the moment and knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Centurion Osborne reporting for duty to Mr. Guy Borden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice echoed in the room, prompting a quick exchange of glances between Guy and Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both men wore cold smiles that quickly vanished as they composed themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in," Guy said, his tone feigning seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped inside with an air of calm confidence, saluting both Guy and Bruno before standing quietly to the side, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy scrutinized Osborne, taking in the young centurion before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the past few days, Guy had heard countless rumors about Osborne&mdash;how he had been buying slaves in the market, offending various factions, crossing Deity Overlord Fabian, and even rejecting overtures from his brother, Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy had also learned about Osborne's creation of the Spark of Blaze, with which he had taken down both Fabian and Gilbert, two Deity Overlords, and annihilated the Wolfe and Keynes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet this was the first time Guy had actually laid eyes on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching him maintain such a calm demeanor, Guy felt a twinge of irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most centurions who came to meet him were nervous, trembling with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne stood there, composed, as if he was unimpressed by Guy's authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then Guy remembered that within the Spark of Blaze, there was a mysterious warrior who was even stronger than he was&mdash;a late-stage Deity Overlord. That thought made him feel a bit better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "So this guy thinks he can act so brazenly just because he has that warrior backing him? This is the Wild Flame Army; if I want to kill you, that mysterious Deity Overlord won't save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he dares to step foot in my territory, he'll be asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll let you bask in your arrogance for a little longer, but soon enough, I'll take you out and claim all your Essence Crystals and treasures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, Guy put on a friendly smile and said, "Osborne, it's great to finally see you! My brother Laird has been singing your praises, calling you a rare talent&mdash;a genius, in fact! It's a pity he tried to recruit you and ended up disappointed when you turned him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now that you're part of the Wild Flame Army, I took the liberty of requesting you for my team, and here you are! With you on board, my battalion is going to be even more formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rest assured, under my command, no one dares to target the Human Community or you! I, Guy, value ability above all else, and I won't let anyone with talent go to waste! With your strength, I'll be able to promote you to chiliarch in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing his spiel, Guy stood up and walked over to Osborne, extending his hand with a broad smile that radiated warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't overheard Guy and Bruno's conversation, he might have believed that Guy was a genuinely approachable leader who valued his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people would feel a surge of excitement in the presence of such a "great leader," eager to prove their worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Osborne, it was all just laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "No wonder you're a Deity Overlord and the leader of ten thousand for the Wild Flame Army. Your acting skills are top-notch! But I've already seen through your charade. If you want to play a part, then let's dance, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a heartfelt expression spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Guy Borden, for recognizing my potential! I'll do my best to learn from you and aim for a promotion to chiliarch as quickly as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flicker of ambition sparkled in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy suppressed a sneer, a hint of condescension flickering in his gaze. He mused, "This fool really thinks I've taken a liking to him? Dream on! He believes he can earn his stripes and become a chiliarch? What a joke! It seems my upcoming plans will go off without a hitch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maintaining his smile, Guy replied, "I'm glad to hear that! With your strength, I'm sure you'll make a name for yourself in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me introduce you to someone. This is a chiliarch, Bruno Borden, my most valued subordinate. For the time being, you'll be under his command. With his guidance, I'm confident you'll soon rise to the rank of chiliarch and become one of my trusted right-hand men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Bruno, Guy continued, "Bruno, Osborne here is a real gem for our battalion. With a little effort, he could easily achieve chiliarch status! You need to take him under your wing and help him make achievements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno, serious and eager to comply, nodded vigorously. "You can count on me, Mr. Guy Borden! I'll make sure we get the job done!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
