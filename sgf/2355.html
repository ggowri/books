  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you getting happy too soon?" Primordial looked at Osborne with a teasing gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "This is a mature Warfare Ancient Tree. It indeed has four Sacred Artifacts growing on it. But do you have what it takes to get them? Can you pass the Warfare Ancient Tree's trial?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's excitement vanished instantly. He couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Yes, although Sacred Artifacts grow on this Warfare Ancient Tree, it won't be easy for me to get them. I must pass the Warfare Ancient Tree's trial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on previous experience, if Osborne wants to obtain these four Sacred Artifacts, he must defeat the projections of the four Sacred Artifacts in the virtual space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they are four Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the virtual space, the power of these four Sacred Artifacts can fully unleash. With Osborne's current strength, he absolutely cannot defeat the four Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, he can't even defeat one. If he can break through to become a warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, he might have a chance to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he uses the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he has a chance to succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is a supreme Sacred Artifact, ranked higher than the four Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree. Even though it is severely damaged, its power surpasses that of those four Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he can use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Osborne can pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the test is conducted within the virtual space, where everything is a projection. Osborne can project the Ascending Sacred Sanctum inside, but he cannot project the Sacred Crystal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Sacred Crystal as an energy source and relying solely on Osborne's Sacred Power to drive it, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's power would at best compare to an ordinary low-grade Sacred Artifact, or even be inferior to the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne simply cannot pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown deeply, pondering a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, four Sacred Artifacts and hundreds of quasi-Sacred Artifact-level warships were hanging on the Warfare Ancient Tree. However, Osborne couldn't get his hands on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely frustrated, as if he had entered a mountain full of treasures but couldn't take any of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Primordial. Seeing Primordial's teasing smile, he suddenly thought of something. "Primordial, do you have a way?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Primordial put away the smile and said, "I have no way. My current strength is not as good as yours. If you can't pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree, I certainly can't either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, looking at Primordial suspiciously, feeling that Primordial wasn't telling the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are your terms? As long as you can help me get those four Sacred Artifacts from the tree, I can agree to your conditions," Osborne said to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really wanted to get those four Sacred Artifacts from the tree, especially the warship and the shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Ascending Sacred Sanctum had already been exposed and could no longer be used easily. Otherwise, if those hunting Agatha discovered it, his situation would become very dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That Sacred Artifact-level warship could, to some extent, replace the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, and the shield would greatly enhance Osborne's defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the state duel, compared to Agatha and Horace, Osborne's biggest disadvantage was the Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha and Horace both possessed multiple Sacred Artifacts, including offensive and defensive ones, but Osborne only had the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt he lacked a Sacred Artifact for close combat and a Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Sacred Artifacts on this Warfare Ancient Tree perfectly met his needs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne didn't particularly like spears and war blades, having them was better than nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, help me get these four Sacred Artifacts," Osborne said seriously, looking at Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shrugged and said, "Alright. Since you're asking me, it would be unkind of me not to help. However, helping you will cost me a lot. So, that spear among the four Sacred Artifacts will have to be mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded without hesitation and said, "Of course, that's no problem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought Primordial would ask for something he couldn't fulfill, but unexpectedly, Primordial only wanted the spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no interest in spears to begin with, so of course, he agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead. What's your plan?" Osborne looked at Primordial expectantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "I am an offshoot of the World Tree. In the Chaotic World, the Warfare Ancient Tree is a war maniac, always picking fights with other beings and angering many. If not for the World Tree's help, the Warfare Ancient Tree would have been destroyed by other beings long ago."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I can negotiate with the mature Warfare Ancient Tree to modify the test rules, giving you a chance to pass. However, even with this, it will still be tough for you to succeed. Be prepared. If you fail, don't blame me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very excited. "Don't worry. As long as there's a chance, I won't blame you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and then flew toward the massive Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne saw the Warfare Ancient Tree slightly tremble, seemingly communicating with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Primordial returned, looking somewhat angry. "That damned Warfare Ancient Tree! It actually disrespects me like this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did your negotiations fail?" Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Primordial's negotiations with the Warfare Ancient Tree failed, Osborne could only give up on the four Sacred Artifacts for now and wait until his strength grew stronger, reaching Empyrean Sacredness, to try again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, this place is hidden enough for most people to not find it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, once Osborne becomes strong enough, he might no longer desire these Sacred Artifacts as much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial shook his head and said, "Our negotiations weren't a complete failure. I asked it to directly give me the four Sacred Artifacts, but it refused. However, it agreed to lower the trial requirements for you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It can limit the power of the four Sacred Artifacts, reducing their level to low-grade. As long as you can defeat any one of the four Sacred Artifacts, it will give you all the fruits and leaves."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a hint of pride flashed in Primordial's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. Then, he glared fiercely at Primordial, thinking, "Primordial clearly succeeded in the negotiation but pretended to fail. Is he messing with me on purpose? Still, I have to thank Primordial this time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Warfare Ancient Tree limits the power of the four Sacred Artifacts, reducing them to low-grade, I&rsquo;ll have a chance to defeat one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the power of a fully unleashed low-grade Sacred Artifact is still terrifying, with the help of the Bloodwrought Bow, I can give it a try. Fight!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth tightly, staring at the four Sacred Artifacts, pondering which one to choose as his challenge target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spear and battle blade are both Attacking Sacred Artifacts, challenging them is risky. If Osborne's defense can't hold up, he will quickly be defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warship is a versatile Sacred Artifact, capable of both defense and attack, making it very difficult to deal with.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that shield is the most powerful among the four Sacred Artifacts. Even if its grade is limited to low-grade, Osborne is unsure if he can break through its defense when it fully unleashes its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a headache, thinking, "How should I choose? It seems no matter what I pick, this trial will be incredibly tough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he gritted his teeth and said, "I choose to challenge that shield."</span></p><div class="pagination">
