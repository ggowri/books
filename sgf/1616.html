  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, hold on a second!" Osborne called out to her as she stepped further ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana turned </span><span>around,</span><span> confusion etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong? If you're feeling scared, you can just let me go ahead alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not scared! I just have a feeling... there's a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lying in wait right around the next bend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious? You can sense it? Do you have some kind of power to predict danger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes lit up with excitement. "You really have a danger-sensing power! That's fantastic! With that ability, your safety is much more assured. At least we don't have to worry about being ambushed by a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't share in her enthusiasm; instead, he was pondering how to leverage this opportunity to give Riley and Emmett a run for their money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> hidden ahead, lying in wait, was a Deity Overlord&mdash;smart and powerful, even more formidable than any Osborne had encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was confident he could handle it, he had no desire to expose his strength just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he revealed his capabilities, Riley and Emmett would be on high alert around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be more strategic to avoid confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he go around it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered that option. Even though the rocks and soil surrounding Divine Peak Nine had specialized energy barriers, making them incredibly tough&mdash;almost impenetrable even to earth elemental power&mdash;his spatial power was relatively unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily use it to maneuver quietly past the concealed </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, leaving Riley and Emmett to deal with whatever awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But revealing that spatial power was a risk he was reluctant to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What to do?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and Emmett were only a little over half a mile behind them. If he couldn't come up with a plan soon, his chance to prank them might slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Diana again. "Do you have any idea how we could bypass that </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and avoid a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes brightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! I get it! You want Riley and Emmett to face the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> instead. You're planning to set a trap for them, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "They're out to get me, so if I get the chance, I'm definitely going to strike back. But to pull off this little trick, we need to sneak by that </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> without alerting it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had long been dissatisfied with Riley and Emmett and was eager for a chance to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have an idea!" she exclaimed, pulling out a small orb that instantly captured Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana quickly explained, "This is a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> Relic! It's an eye left behind by a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> after it died, and it's a mutated one! It contains a unique essence of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> power. If we activate this essence and envelop ourselves in it, other </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> will mistake us for one of their own and won't attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Deathborn</span><span> Relics are rare, and the power inside is limited. Using even a little bit means it's gone for good, which is why we don't use it lightly&mdash;only in life-or-death situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that you've confirmed there's a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> hiding ahead, we can use this Relic to disguise our presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ambushing </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> will think we are allies and leave us alone! It will only strike once Riley and Emmett pass by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana finished speaking, Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> Relic? That's a fantastic find! With this, there's no way we won't set them up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another moment, they sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana channeled her divine power into the relic, which suddenly radiated an unusual energy that wrapped around both her and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" she urged, and they moved deeper into the tunnel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained alert. Although Diana was confident the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> Relic would mask their presence and keep them safe, he couldn't shake the anxiety creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were close to a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>&mdash;one with cunning intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, they approached the spot where the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Diana finally saw the creature, who was camouflaged and poised to strike, shock washed over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne was right! He really can sense danger!" she thought, but she kept silent, focusing on staying hidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the protection of the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> Relic, she and Osborne slipped right past the looming threat without triggering any response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved swiftly away from the danger, the tension easing as they got further from the ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far behind them, Riley and Emmett were steadily making their way into the darkness, oblivious to the peril that lay ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
