  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a boom, the rock beneath Osborne's feet suddenly split apart as if a ferocious T-Rex had erupted from the ground. A terrifying force shot straight toward Osborne's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He barely had time to release his martial art aura before the force struck him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The immense power shattered Osborne's martial art aura, slamming heavily into his chest. His body was hurled like a cannonball, crashing through tree after tree. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and his chest throbbed with intense pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne's body came to a halt, but he quickly realized he was surrounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of him stood Sam, a cold smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's body resembled a towering grizzly bear, brimming with fearsome muscle. It was Sam who had suddenly attacked from below, catching Osborne off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wiping the blood from his mouth, Osborne surveyed his situation, his expression darkening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been too careless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments ago, he had been too focused on the battle, observing Rodney and the others, and had completely overlooked the threat beneath him. He hadn't anticipated that Sam would lead an underground ambush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time Sam launched his attack, it was too late for Osborne to evade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The searing pain in his chest told Osborne that several of his ribs were broken. Even though he possessed extraordinary healing abilities, it would take some time to fully recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He let out a cold snort, fixing his gaze on Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's smirk deepened. "Osborne, you're not the only one who can launch a sneak attack from underground. Didn't see that coming, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted, "I didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam chuckled. "Now, if you hand over the Heir's Emblem, I might let you off easy. Otherwise, you might not leave the Lostridge Mountains standing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're surrounded, and the space around you is frozen. There's no escape. If you dare to face me, I'll break every bone in your body!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam's expression twisted into a beastly grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne surveyed the surroundings again and snorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was right. Under these circumstances, escape was impossible. If he didn't defeat Sam, leaving would be out of the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that case, there was no choice but to fight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fierce battle intent ignited in Osborne's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne's resolve, Sam's eyes gleamed with a predatory light, his face contorting with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you're refusing to hand over the Heir's Emblem and plan to resist? Fine, I'll give you what you want! I promised to break your limbs and crush every bone in your body!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam, brimming with confidence, signaled the others to step back. He wanted to deal with Osborne personally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne replied coldly, "You want to break my limbs and crush my bones? Good, because I'm thinking the same thing! Let's see who ends up breaking whose bones!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne readied himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was incredibly powerful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the heirs of the nine branches of the Augustine family, Sam was recognized as the strongest, second only to Lance, surpassing even David and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only was Sam a Class AA metahuman, but he was also a Class AA martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His power wasn't Satan's Eye but a more common transformation ability. He could transform into an ancient berserk bear, making his strength and defense nearly unstoppable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the entire Augustine family, there were few who could surpass Sam in raw power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew he had to be extremely cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's do this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam cracked his neck and beckoned Osborne forward. "I hear you're a martial artist too. Show me what you've got. let's see if you're worth my full effort."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you wish!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said coldly, clenching his fist and unleashing a powerful blow toward Sam using his Spiral Force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This punch carried almost all of Osborne's strength, holding nothing back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next second, Sam raised his arm and spread his fingers, effortlessly blocking Osborne's punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's body barely moved, save for a slight tremor, and then he was still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An icy smile played on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all you've got? If so, you're not even worth my full strength. I'm a little disappointed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're celebrating too soon! Try taking this punch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne struck again. This time, he unleashed the Ninefold Tide Crash, a technique he had mastered to its peak, and it could double his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the Ninefold Tide Crash surged forward, Sam's expression finally shifted, growing serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Ninefold Tide Crash at its peak?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect you to have mastered the Ninefold Tide Crash to its peak, reaching all nine waves! Impressive! Even I've only managed to master eight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it's a shame, your base strength isn't strong enough. Even with the Ninefold Tide Crash, you won't be able to harm me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam unleashed his own punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their fists collided, creating a terrifying explosion as immense power clashed. Both men staggered backward from the impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne retreated five steps, while Sam only stepped back three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's cold smile returned. "Not bad, you made me take three steps back! But that's still not enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't waste any more time. I need to finish you off quickly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, Sam activated his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Transform!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ancient Berserk Bear!"</p><div class="pagination">
