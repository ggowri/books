  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bizarre battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the half-human-sized Ghostwing Insects were discovered, bursting in mid-air and showering the ground with their dark purple blood, which quickly mingled with the already purple-black soil, hissing as it soaked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the onslaught, many Ghostwing Insects slipped through the cracks. Their attacks were unnervingly precise, capable of easily piercing the divine power defenses of Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings. Even Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings struggled to withstand multiple strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If overwhelmed, their bodies would explode in a gruesome display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King could hope to fend off the relentless attacks of these creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piercing screams echoed through the air, and in just a matter of breaths, nearly half of the three exploration teams had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred members were lost to the bizarre assaults of the Ghostwing Insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grim reality sent shockwaves through the remaining explorers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face turned pale, her petite frame trembling slightly as she murmured, "It's true&mdash;the area outside Elf City is perilous! It's far too dangerous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, she expanded her divine power defense, enveloping him within its protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met her gaze, and Alfreda forced a smile that was more like a grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she longed to flee from this nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda knew she couldn't abandon her mission. She had to find ten Flame Gold Crystals to compensate Princess Monica; otherwise, the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family would not let her off the hook. Even returning to Elf City wouldn't spare her from punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling voice rang out, cutting through the chaos. It was filled with authority and pride, demanding the attention of all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, listen up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to see Uriel, the Oracle Heir ranked third at the Ethereal Elven Temple, stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a commanding gaze sweeping across the exploration teams, he declared, "All team leaders, rally your squads and advance! Maintain formation as we enter the mushroom forest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This forest is the first barrier to Umbra Earth. Only by passing through it can we truly enter the depths of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are countless treasures from Umbra World waiting for us! Ghostwing Insects are nothing but a minor nuisance. Together, we can cut through them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to hold back... well, they might as well turn back now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Uriel waved his hand, signaling for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Uriel and his team surged toward the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His squad was the strongest among the hundred, not only because he was the most powerful with an Ascension Seven level, but also due to the fact that all his teammates were Ascension Five or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were five Ascension Six warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one Ascension Seven, five Ascension Six, and ninety-four Ascension Five warriors, Uriel's team possessed formidable strength. This combination of power made Uriel fearless in the face of the Ghostwing Insects. Leading his team like a sharp blade, he plunged directly into the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This forest was home to the Ghostwing Insects, and they wasted no time in launching their attacks against any intruders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Uriel's team entered, a wave of Ghostwing Insects surged forward, their energy pulses boiling in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless attacks erupted, but Uriel and his team expertly deflected each one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved swiftly, striking down the Ghostwing Insects that revealed themselves through their energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of insects exploding filled the air, and the team pressed on, determined to carve their path through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Ghostwing Insects exploded under the onslaught of Uriel and his team, their dark purple blood staining the ground as they pressed deeper into the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone knew it, Uriel's exploration team had pushed far into the heart of the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left the other teams in sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Uriel's team is incredibly strong!" one explorer exclaimed, wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but treasure hunting in Umbra Earth isn't just about raw power. Luck plays a big role too! We've got to keep up, or we'll be left to sift through the scraps!" another quickly added, determination lighting his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the other exploration teams sprang into action, their resolve solidifying as they charged into the forest like a wave of sharpened blades, ready to cut through whatever stood in their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More Ghostwing Insects began to appear, desperate to halt their advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their efforts proved futile; these creatures could only pose a threat to Supernal Deity Kings below Ascension Five. For anyone at that level or higher, the insects were no match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each squad had several Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings among them, forming a protective barrier to absorb incoming attacks. As they fought back, losses remained minimal while the teams rapidly exterminated the Ghostwing Insects and forged ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, more than half of the exploration teams had stormed into the depths of the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching this unfold, Alfreda felt a whirl of uncertainty cross her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery said, urgency pulling at her voice, "Captain, we should move in too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to act! If we wait much longer, we'll miss our chance! With everyone else diving in, we'll be left with no support against the Ghostwing Insects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville, Arabela, and Beverly cast anxious glances at Alfreda, all waiting for her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip, weighing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just have this feeling... there's more danger lurking within the mushroom forest..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery frowned, cutting in. "Captain, we've already come this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't back out now. Even if we know danger lies ahead, sticking with the larger group means we'll have backup. If we delay, we're left facing the threats all alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, two-thirds of the exploration teams had vanished into the chaotic thicket, their forms swallowed by the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's anxiety grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally relented. "Alright! Let's move! Onward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, excitement lit up the faces of Avery, Neville, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all aware of the dangers that awaited them within Umbra Earth, but the allure of its treasures overrode their fears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another moment's hesitation, the nine-member team sprang into action, rushing toward the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the entrance, they were met by a barrage of energy pulses, each brimming with hostile intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the Ghostwing Insects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Full defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We take them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, attacks slammed against Alfreda, Avery, and the others' divine power defenses, sparking powerful waves of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, they proved resilient; the Ghostwing Insects' assaults couldn't breach their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over them, and then it was time to strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, Neville, Godfrey, Hermione, along with Beverly and Cyrus&mdash;six Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;quickly rallied, targeting the Ghostwing Insects that had revealed themselves amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shared determination, the nine explorers forged deeper into the mushroom forest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
