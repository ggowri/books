  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive and luxurious Malevolence Airship sliced through the sky like a gleaming sword, moving faster than lightning before coming to a halt above Zone 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the airship, three young figures emerged&mdash;two men and one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was an exceptionally handsome young man, his face radiating confidence and a natural air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A closer look revealed that he was a member of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More specifically, he was a descendant of the Paramount Supreme Clan&mdash;the bloodline of Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, the young man, Tobey Bowman, caused the enormous Malevolence Airship to shrink rapidly, fitting neatly into his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two companions behind him, a man and a woman, gazed at the now-vanished airship with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, the speed of the Supreme Malevolence Airship is incredible! It's a whopping 150 thousand miles to Wild Flame City, and even the Ultimate Malevolence Airship would take at least half an hour to get here. But with your Supreme Malevolence Airship, we made it in just a few minutes! That's unreal!" the woman exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey smiled coolly, his pride evident, "Of course! The Supreme Malevolence Airship is the pinnacle of divine artifact vessels crafted by the Artisan Institute. It can match the full-speed flight of a typical Deity King warrior, exceeding speeds of 600 thousand miles per hour with ease! Plus, it boasts formidable defenses. While it may not rival the Supreme Malevolence Shield, it can withstand a couple of attacks from a Deity King warrior without breaking a sweat. And let's not forget, it's equipped with two main cannons and ten secondary cannons! It can even perform </span><span>inter-dimensional</span><span> travel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Tobey's expression grew even more arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Airship was a symbol of status, a privilege reserved exclusively for the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the two behind him, who belonged to the Demonic Dragon Clan&mdash;ranked third among Lord Malevolence's top ten Upper Races&mdash;were not entitled to such a luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, Sara Royston, looked at him with even more admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped closer, wrapping her arm around Tobey's, her chest pressing against him as she playfully said, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, I wish I could have a Supreme Malevolence Airship too! Can you talk to the folks at the Artisan Institute and let the Royston family buy one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the softness of her body against his arm, Tobey felt a rush of heat but maintained his cool demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not possible! The Supreme Malevolence Airship is only available to the Paramount Supreme Clan. Other clans need to achieve great feats to earn one, granted by the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself! The Royston family is powerful, but you're not quite at that level yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sara's face fell at his words, disappointment washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tobey quickly added, "However, if you play nice, I could lend you the Supreme Malevolence Airship for a few days! Whenever I'm near Wild Flame City, you can come find me. I'll take you for a spin! And we can have a little fun while we're at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a teasing glint in his eye, he looked at Sara, causing her to blush deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She playfully punched his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, you're so naughty! Just remember to be gentle with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Don't worry, I'll be gentle," he replied, his voice dripping with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Tobey reached out, his hand boldly gripping Sara's boobs right there in the open. She let out a soft, surprised gasp, the sound barely escaping her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other young man, Myron Royston, Sara's brother, turned his head away, pretending not to see. Yet, deep down, he found himself hoping that his sister would successfully capture Tobey's interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ideally, he thought, something steamy might even happen between them right here and now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tobey was enjoying the moment, his playful grasp on Sara suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough of that for now! I came here to hunt down the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Myron, his expression shifting from playful to serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Myron, are you sure we can find a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> here? You know that I was recently defeated by that mysterious woman. I swear I'm going to get my revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's no pushover. Though she's at the peak of Celestial Deity, her strength is definitely on par with an average Deity Overlord! If I want to take her down, I need to either break through to Deity Overlord myself or have the power to defeat an ordinary Deity Overlord warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> is the perfect training partner for me right now. I need to push my limits in real combat, defeat that damned woman, and then... I'll have her beneath me, utterly at my mercy, and then I'll take her head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's voice dripped with fury, his eyes blazing with anger as divine power surged from him, creating an oppressive atmosphere that weighed heavily on Myron and Sara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they, too, were at the peak of Celestial Deity, they felt dwarfed by Tobey's intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron quickly interjected, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, don't worry! There's definitely a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> in this area! We've been trying to hunt it down for a while now, but we haven't succeeded yet. This time, though, we have the Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid. It should draw it out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
