  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Handle the Beast Tide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian was taken aback, clearly struggling to wrap his head around Osborne's bold claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, frowning, "How are you planning to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Beast Tide is brewing. There are at least 100 thousand Ferocious Beasts within a radius of several dozen miles, possibly even more! Just the Class A beasts alone </span><span>were</span><span> in the thousands&mdash;this is already what you'd call a medium-sized Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Beast Tide of this magnitude could easily breach a small city! Even if Newport City is protected by countless Ancient Families and formidable forces, I doubt they could hold out without sustaining significant losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Beast Tide is beyond dealing with. There's no way to resolve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His companions behind him nodded in agreement. Rihanna quickly said, "Osborne, don't be reckless! Just hear me out. We all know you have some serious skills, coming from Newport City's Augustine family and all&mdash;one of the top powers around, basically the crown jewel of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I've heard that many of the younger generation of the Augustine family have made breakthroughs into Class S! But let me tell you, even a Class S wouldn't stand a chance against a Beast Tide of this size. Once surrounded, they'd be toast, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this situation is unmanageable. We can only defend ourselves passively!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their concern, Osborne maintained his calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appreciated their intentions, even if they seemed panicked in the face of Dark Exotic Beasts. They genuinely cared about his safety, and he respected that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they weren't wrong; overcoming a Beast Tide of this scale wasn't something just any team could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if all three of them were top-tier Class S fighters, they'd be outmatched and forced to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they weren't just three people, were they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, Osborne replied, "It'll be fine! If we don't address this Beast Tide early on, it'll inevitably attack Newport City, and innocent lives will be lost. I believe it's better to take care of them now rather than later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it's not just the three of us heading into this. We have backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian and the others frowned at that news. "Backup isn't going to change much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about a Beast Tide with hundreds of thousands of beasts! In the jungle of the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, this is their home turf&mdash;no amount of help can turn the </span><span>tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unruffled. "Well, that's not necessarily true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his unwavering confidence, the group felt a surge of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian turned to Anastasia and Zoe. "You two, please convince him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His plan is </span><span>way too dangerous. There's no way it can work. We can't afford to take risks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe exchanged glances, their faces breaking into smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to convince him! Osborne is the best! If he says he can pull it off, then he absolutely can! I mean, what's 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts? He can take them all down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that proclamation, the four were left gaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred thousand Ferocious Beasts?! He plans to take them all down?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne and his sisters, incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed utterly insane, like the trio were courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they were about to launch into another round of cautionary advice, Osborne suddenly grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like my helpers have arrived! Come on, since we've run into each other, it's time for you to </span><span>witness something spectacular! You'll see how this Beast Tide composed of 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts gets handled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne cast his gaze skyward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Blood Demon were on their way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over four thousand members of the Blood Demon were gathered, their presence a formidable testament to the hard work they had put in during the three months that Osborne had been in slumber. They hadn't been idle; every day was filled with rigorous training. Not only had they all advanced beyond Class S, but their teamwork and synergy had also reached new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combat tactics, whether in small teams or larger groups, had become second nature, woven into their very blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, they had upgraded their weapons and gear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Materials Research Institute had made a significant breakthrough by studying Osborne's Goddess of Grain's scythe, successfully creating a new, high-strength material known as Hyper Diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Hyper Diamond in hand, the production of super energy guns was set to go into full swing. While the cost of these weapons remained high, it allowed every member of the Blood Demon to be outfitted with their own super energy gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the over four thousand Blood Demon members was now armed with this powerful weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their defensive armor had also been upgraded to Hyper Diamond, significantly enhancing their protection. Now, even a Class S warrior would find it challenging to breach their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the Blood Demon members had become stronger than ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they swiftly ascended above the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, each member radiated the aura of Class S, converging together like a sword poised to pierce the sky, instilling a deep sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a six-mile radius, every Ferocious Beast sensed their overwhelming presence and was immediately thrown into a state of panic. Some cowered on the ground, while others fled in a chaotic scramble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Cillian and his siblings caught sight of the Blood Demon members and felt the sheer power emanating from them, their faces turned pale, their bodies stiffened, and terror washed over them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
