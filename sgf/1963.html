  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless attacks rained down upon Osborne, shattering and dissipating against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that this was the Ascension Stairway's test for those attempting to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The challenge was formidable, but unfortunately for it, it had met Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his hands clasped behind his back, he faced the onslaught head-on, a proud smirk gracing his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he felt an urge to shout, "Bring on the storm! I can take whatever you throw at me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, these attacks were almost mundane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could distinctly feel the shift in his power. Each strike could give even the most seasoned Ascension One Supernal Deity King a headache, and an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King would likely find themselves nursing injuries if they weren't careful. The sheer volume of attacks would force any Ascension Two Supernal Deity King to retreat or dodge, fleeing as far as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, these assaults felt like nothing more than a tickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what this means is that I could just stand here and let an Ascension One Supernal Deity King attack me, and I'd be just fine! Even if thousands of warriors at Deity King Level swarmed me, they wouldn't be able to budge me an inch! My Infinite Sacred Body is too powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but marvel at his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a high-tier Supernal Deity King could struggle against a horde of warriors at Deity King Level. Their attacks, while not enough to breach defenses, could still sap energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that energy was depleted, no matter how high his rank, he'd be done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Infinite Sacred Body was so robust that it could withstand the attacks of warriors at Deity King Level without consuming his own energy. He could face an onslaught without fear of being worn down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't break through his defenses, he was invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless barrage continued for a solid half-hour before it finally began to wane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the Ascension Stairway had realized that its assaults were futile against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained steadfast, not even shifting his stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there another challenge?" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his previous experiences, the tests on the Ascension Stairway usually consisted of just one. He had already faced more trials than most, and by all rights, his challenge should have ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he stood, the Ascension Stairway still looming, and he hadn't officially passed the test to become a Supernal Deity King. The atmosphere was heavy with silence, as if the Stairway was preparing to unleash an even greater trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scoff, he declared, "Is that all you've got?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on! No matter how many tests you throw at me, nothing will stop me from becoming a Supernal Deity King! Nothing will hold me back from growing stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his arms still crossed behind his back, he waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 10 long minutes, the Ascension Stairway finally stirred again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It began to tremble violently, and suddenly, a brilliant portal materialized in the void, expanding rapidly until it burst open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Chrono-Spatial Gateway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squinted, sensing something was amiss. The next moment, he saw a phantom figure slowly emerging from the Chrono-Spatial Gateway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You anomaly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous voice reverberated in Osborne's mind, shaking the very depths of his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, focusing intently on the ethereal figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appeared to be a massive white tiger, coiled at the end of the Ascension Stairway. Its size was colossal, nearly blotting out the sky, and its icy gaze looked down upon Osborne with disdain and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this? A tiger? And it calls me an anomaly? Is this really part of the Ascension Stairway's test?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt increasingly bewildered by the nature of his trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice of the massive white tiger boomed again. "Anomaly! You should not exist in this world! You must be erased forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeper, "You think I'm an anomaly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white tiger didn't respond. It seemed devoid of consciousness, like a programmed automaton. After declaring its intent to eliminate him, it lunged forward without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eradicate the anomaly! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful swipe of its massive claws, the white tiger struck toward Osborne. In that instant, time and space seemed to warp, and the razor-sharp claws were suddenly upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed was blinding; Osborne barely had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The claws crashed into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a deep gash appeared on his chest, golden blood oozing from the wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked down, his expression turning cold and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Infinite Sacred Body, which had withstood countless assaults, had been wounded by a casual swipe from this white tiger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force behind that strike was undoubtedly comparable to a full-force attack from an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, if not more powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened as he glared at the colossal white tiger, his eyes filled with icy resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiger's voice echoed again, "Anomaly, you're strong! But the stronger you are, the more you must be eliminated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your existence threatens to destroy the balance of this world! So, you must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that proclamation, the white tiger lunged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flurry of claw shadows filled the air, blocking out the light as they rained down upon Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each claw strike packed the power of an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King's Divine Ascendance Technique. This onslaught left no room for escape, aiming to obliterate him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just a test! Everyone faces challenges based on their strength, and if they fail, it's just a setback! Why is it that when it's my turn, the trials keep piling on, as if you're determined to stop me? And now you want to kill me? You call me an anomaly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For what? Just because you're a big white tiger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can decide my fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to kill me, then you better be prepared to die yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling resolve, Osborne ignored the multitude of claw shadows above him. Power surged through him, gathering in his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crouched low, then launched himself upward with a mighty push!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot skyward, shattering the claw shadows that tried to smother him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged through the air, a force of nature, and in the blink of an eye, he was face-to-face with the massive white tiger, their eyes locking in a fierce confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiger's gaze was filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with defiance. "You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he unleashed a devastating punch that connected squarely with the tiger's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force erupted, and in an instant, the white tiger was obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anomaly! How dare you destroy my projection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark my words! This time, I was unprepared, and my projection lacked energy. But when you break through to Ascension Four, we will meet again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I will make sure to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tiger's furious voice echoed, quickly fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne noticed the Ascension Stairway rapidly disappearing, leaving only one stair behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had succeeded in his breakthrough!</span></p><div class="pagination">
