  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whip struck Theodore again and again, and he could only hold Vivienne tightly, using his back to shield her from all the blows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Theodore, stop protecting me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, they'll beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Vivienne felt very anxious. She wanted to shield Theodore from some of the whipping, but he held her tightly, not giving her any chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He endured the pain and insisted, "Vivienne, listen to me now! This time, I might really be done for. They're definitely going to kill someone to vent their anger. Otherwise, they won't stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that's the case, then let me die first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must strive to live, don't give up. I believe there will be a chance! It doesn't matter if I die. As long as you're alive, I'll be satisfied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Theodore's back was already torn open, exposing his bones. Yet those who were beating and torturing him still had no intention of stopping, their murderous intent and anger remaining intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne's delicate face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew Theodore was right. These people would definitely kill to vent their anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least one of them had to die, or even both of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he was desperately protecting her because he wanted to use his death to let these people vent their anger. That way, she could survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! I won't allow it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne's eyes were filled with tears. "We'll die together! If you die, I can't go on either. I don't want to live alone. I'd rather die with you. That way, we can still have each other!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore instantly became extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vivienne, don't be impulsive! You still have a chance. You can definitely survive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne's attitude was unwavering. "If you die, I can't go on! All these years, you've been my only support. If you die, I absolutely won't live alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people around heard their conversation. The dozen or so Frenetic Storm Warband members burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to die together? That's easy. We'll make it happen for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beat them hard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Separate them and then beat them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whip kept lashing Theodore and Vivienne. As a result, their bodies were covered in blood and wounds. Yet, they refused to beg for mercy, though deep despair filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seemed to see the arrival of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the fifty-plus slaves watched them in pain, but they could do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of the whip continued relentlessly. Theodore and Vivienne's breathing grew weaker and weaker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were about to die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, memories of the past twenty years flashed through their minds, filled only with darkness and despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we finally going to be free?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne, Angela, and Agatha appeared in the void not far from this resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was still in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although this is just a Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator, you actually succeeded! It seems like we've been transported near that resource-bearing planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela pointed at a resource-bearing planet not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's wrong! On that resource-bearing planet, there's a strong energy fluctuation. It seems like many people are fighting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally made it here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he looked at that resource-bearing planet, his face instantly turned grim. He had Satan's Eye, so he could see more clearly than Angela. He noticed the chaos happening there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless people with Slave Brands on their faces were frantically fleeing and hiding, while numerous members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were chasing, beating, and even slaughtering them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the resource-bearing planet, those slaves seemed to be resisting, trying to break free from the Frenetic Storm Warband's enslavement. For these slaves, it was a rare opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the mid-to-high-level members of the Frenetic Storm Warband in the Phantomagic Realm had all been killed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for him, this was not a good thing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such chaos, if his parents were among them, they would surely look for a chance to escape. As a result, they might also be hunted down and killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, without this chaos, they would soon have awaited Osborne's rescue. With his strength, he could easily eliminate everyone from the Frenetic Storm Warband on this resource-bearing planet and save them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the situation has become complicated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May God bless them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May God bless them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was deeply worried about his parents. He had no time to pay attention to Angela and Agatha, directly using interdimensional travel to rush toward that resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, his Satan's Eye was pushed to its limit, focusing on this resource-bearing planet to search for his parents' whereabouts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Osborne and his parents had a connection. When he looked in one direction, he immediately saw what was happening in that canyon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a middle-aged couple was being brutally whipped by more than a dozen members of the Frenetic Storm Warband. Their bodies were covered in blood, their flesh torn open, exposing their bones. Their situation was utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their breathing was extremely weak. They were on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their hands were tightly clasped together. Even as those dozen people brutally whipped their hands, tearing their flesh and breaking their bones, their clasped hands never separated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were beaten beyond recognition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for some reason, the moment he saw them, Osborne froze. Everything around him seemed to vanish, leaving only them in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had a premonition rooted in his bloodline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they were covered in blood and unrecognizable, he instantly knew&mdash;they were his parents in this life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne had never met them before. Shortly after he was born, they were attacked and separated from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he just knew they were his parents, Theodore and Vivienne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everything around seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's eyes, the entire resource-bearing planet seemed frozen, and everyone's movements stopped. He stared intently at his parents, his eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally found them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now they were suffering cruel torture. They were whipped until they were covered in blood, their flesh torn open, bones exposed. Their breaths were incredibly faint.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an overwhelming murderous intent surged from Osborne's chest straight to his mind. His eyes instantly turned blood-red, and the terrifying killing intent shot skyward, enveloping the entire resource-bearing planet in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a crazed and anguished roar. His face twisted with rage. He glared at the dozen culprits whipping his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His killing intent had already boiled over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne vanished from where he stood. Then, he appeared in the canyon, beside his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The world seemed to come alive again. The whip lashed fiercely at Theodore and Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached out and grabbed the whip.</span></p><div class="pagination">
