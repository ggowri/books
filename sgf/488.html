  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, there was no way for Kendra to escape from Osborne. Before she could run away from him, Osborne dragged her collar and pulled her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you running?" Osborne asked unhappily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra pouted, "Osborne, I don't know how to help you. I am the only child of my parents and have no brother at all. I don't know what you are talking about. Bryce? Who is Bryce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Kendra helplessly. The scene where Kendra alleged Bryce was her brother despite others' suspicion and disbelief was still echoing in his mind, but now, she denied something she tried so hard to make others believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Alright, stop pretending. I already know that Bryce is your brother and have met him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Kendra's eyes widened in disbelief. "You have already met him? Did he come to find me? It's impossible. How could he find me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I told him! At that time, I wasn't sure whether you were his sister or not, so I asked him in person, and he admitted it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You told him I was with you?" The disbelief disappeared, and she said with a look of suspicion, "Osborne, I don't mean to suspect you, but I just really doubt how Bryce agreed to meet you? You shouldn't have..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Are you trying to say that I'm not qualified to meet him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra laughed awkwardly. "I didn't mean that. Osborne, you are still young. When you reach Bryce's age, you will definitely be better than him. Trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how on earth did you meet him?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because he saved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne told Kendra some details he could say about the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attack on the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it still couldn't dispel her confusion. "You mean he saved you? How could that happen? Never mind. The most important thing is why he didn't come to catch me </span><span>after learning I was here with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I promised Bryce that I would take good care of you, so he decided to let you stay with me for a while," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Kendra was suspicious of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Of course, it's true. Why do I have to lie to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, why don't I feel you have ever taken care of me for such a long time? It has been Yulissa staying with me! You liar, my brother will know this!" Kendra said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt out of his words for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, he finally said, "If you are worried that Bryce will take you back after he knows your whereabouts, save it, because he already knows that you are here with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, since I couldn't spare time to ask for his number last time, I have you ask for your help to contact him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the reward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about his proposal while rubbing her chin, Kendra finally agreed and said, "Well, I'll give it a try! I'm only responsible for telling him what you said. I can't guarantee whether he is willing to help you or not! Bryce is actually very lazy, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Kendra walked to the corner and carefully took out a mobile phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, she came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother agreed. He said he can go with you but won't do anything unless anything critical happens! Moreover, you have to pay him 10 billion dollars as his wage since he has to raise his gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my pleasure for him to come with me. Ten billion dollars won't be a problem." Osborne was very delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his plan succeeded this time, the Walker family, the Luther family, the Marion family, and the Hawthorne family would collapse, and the Augustine family could absorb their properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, the Augustine family would gain more than a hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was absolutely no problem with just giving a small part of it to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, deal. Once you've decided on the time and place, just let me know, and I'll tell my brother." After saying this, Kendra was also very happy because Bryce allowed her to stay with Osborne and play for a while instead of insisting on taking her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could ease the burden on her heart that she would be caught by Bryce's subordinates and taken back from time to time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Kendra about what she was doing recently, Osborne said goodbye to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his room, a cold light flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to start taking action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope the four families won't let me down! Please take the chance I prepared for you and attack with all your strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I can complete the fifth test for a successor as soon as possible depends on this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne found Clarissa. "Clarissa, let's go yacht sailing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, she knew that he was ready to strike and immediately nodded. "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne entrusted Autumn to Yulissa and left for the Augustine family's yacht dock with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he personally drove a luxury yacht towards the depths of the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, in the Luther Estate, Yaron's face was covered with viciousness and rage, and the table had been kicked to pieces by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? You meant the Hummingbird Gang had been destroyed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The head of our vassal family, Gavin, was also killed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even my son, Wallace, the heir of the Luther family, was abducted?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the person who did all this was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell does he want to do?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron was extremely angry and a little anxious. "Where is he now? Did he say what he wanted from me to release Wallace?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
