  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone could clearly feel the overwhelming elemental energy just three miles ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a powerful elemental fluctuation could only indicate one thing&mdash;the Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths quickened, and their pace picked up once more. The eerie calm of this chasm, coupled with the promise of treasure so close, made them almost forget the inherent danger lurking in the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they could think about was reaching the Element Gold Crystals before any other exploration teams discovered them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they hurried through the winding, narrow branches of the fissure, Osborne's voice suddenly cut through the excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, who was leading the pack, immediately halted and turned back, confusion etched on her face. "Osborne, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly, Avery, and the others exchanged puzzled glances toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's danger ahead!" Osborne said calmly, a flicker of urgency in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Satan's Eye, allowing it to scan the half-mile expanse before them. Within moments, the twisted path of the chasm became crystal clear to him, revealing even the hidden threats lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Umbra Earth, the powers of Osborne's Satan's Eye faced considerable suppression from the unique purple-black soil and stones that surrounded them. Its X-ray vision was incredibly difficult to wield here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the intricate labyrinth of the Death Chasm, he could barely see half a mile ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet that was far superior to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfrey's mechanical eye had enhanced vision capabilities and a limited degree of X-ray function to detect hidden creatures, but it couldn't pick out something as stealthy as a Ghostwing Insect, let alone entities concealed behind rocks or buried in the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, thanks to his Satan's Eye, Osborne spotted a group of peculiar, transparent worms, each the size of a calf, clinging motionlessly to the purple-black stones just around the bend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They blended perfectly into their environment, emitting no energy fluctuations. Even Osborne almost overlooked them, only noticing due to their occasional wriggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Worms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled Uriel's warning about them&mdash;creatures far more dreadful than the Ghostwing Insects, boasting superior stealth capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he counted at least thirty of them, clearly the Phantom Worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the weakest among them were formidable, on par with an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, excelling in both defense and attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't spotted them, and they rushed past that corner, they would surely be ambushed by the Phantom Worms' close-range assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the creatures didn't wipe them out entirely, they would certainly inflict heavy casualties&mdash;losing a member or two would be an unavoidable outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda and the others looked at Osborne with uncertainty. He hesitated briefly, knowing he shouldn't reveal the full extent of his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he gestured toward the bend ahead. "I sense danger over there! Just around that corner&mdash;there's something that could threaten us. If I'm not mistaken, it's probably Phantom Worms!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Worms?!" Alfreda and the rest stared at Osborne in shock, skepticism dancing in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure? How reliable is your sense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "My instincts are never wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are definitely Phantom Worms back there, and there are at least twenty or thirty of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Alfreda's expressions and those of the others turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, deciding to trust Osborne. After all, they had heard from Uriel about the formidable nature of Phantom Worms. If there really were that many lurking just around the corner, charging in unprepared would spell trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we take a detour or just fight our way through?" Avery asked, anxiety creeping into her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda responded decisively, "We fight! This Death Chasm is a complex maze; trying to navigate around it is nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, who can guarantee that a detour won't lead us to even more Phantom Worms?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The promise of a treasure trove of Element Gold Crystals lay just a few miles deeper in the chasm branches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were unwilling to backtrack now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda declared, her determination palpable, "With our strength, as long as we don't run into any Phantom Worms on par with an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, we should be fine! Let's take care of these Phantom Worms quickly to avoid any unexpected complications!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here. I'll scout ahead. If those Phantom Worms are too strong, retreat immediately! If we can handle them, we'll strike together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda then wrapped herself in a protective layer of divine power as she moved toward the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose not to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Elf City, she had single-handedly taken on Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley&mdash;four Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;and had easily suppressed and defeated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a</span><span>n average</span><span> Ascension Six Supernal Deity King wouldn't match her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Phantom Worms around the bend were likely to be ordinary ones, equivalent to Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, with only a handful being larger and more formidable, akin to Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her abilities, even if she were surrounded, Alfreda could hold her own for quite some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!" Osborne called out as she approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, a mix of anxiety and fear swirling in her chest. But as the team leader, she knew she had to step up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moved cautiously, inching closer to the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and slowly peeked around the bend, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Alfreda saw left her momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chasm remained eerily quiet, desolate yet strangely calm, with nothing in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No Phantom Worms?" she murmured, but she didn't relax just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing the Phantom Worms' ability to conceal themselves, Alfreda focused intently on sensing any energy fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Nature Elf, she was naturally attuned to the energies of the world around her, finely tuned to detect even the slightest shifts. She believed that even the most stealthy Phantom Worms would emit some trace of energy, something she could pick up on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after several moments of concentrated effort, Alfreda sensed nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief escaped her lips as she turned to Osborne with a smile. "Osborne, your instincts were off this time. There's nothing here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of frustration wash over him at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his Satan's Eye detected movement. The Phantom Worms, previously hidden just around the corner, suddenly sprang to life, leaping with terrifying speed like a swarm of frenzied fleas, charging straight toward Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, watch out!" he shouted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
