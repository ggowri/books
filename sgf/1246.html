  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden thought struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I can pull off another diversion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's another force in this world, just as powerful as the League of Divine Descent&mdash;and just as much of an enemy to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can goad the Deschanel Clan into a feud with the Pantheon League, why not do the same to drag </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> into this mess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this new plan bubbling in his mind, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rummaged through his Dimensional Space, searching for a divine artifact dagger, only to find he had nothing left but the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other divine artifacts had already been distributed to the Blood Demon Vanguard members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves and Volt Hammer had been gifted to Anastasia since she wielded Thunder Power more adeptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her hands, those artifacts would unleash their true potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That left Osborne with just the scythe&mdash;and using the Goddess of Grain's scythe was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too many knew he possessed it, and if Osborne used it in front of those gods, no matter how cleverly he tried to disguise himself, he would surely be recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would lead to major trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to lay the groundwork for his scheme and masquerade as an assassin from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, he needed a divine artifact dagger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I guess I'll have to head back and grab one! I'll hold off on any </span><span>action for now and make a quick trip to the Augustine Bastion to pick up a dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my interdimensional travel speed, I can be back in a quick two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two minutes? That should be manageable, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Pantheon League was in a dire position, he couldn't believe they'd be overwhelmed in just two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne swiftly departed, using interdimensional travel to return to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he returned with a divine artifact dagger in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular dagger was top-tier, a trophy he'd claimed after defeating the second-ranked assassin of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, known as Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd previously awarded this dagger to Ninety-third, but now he borrowed it back for his immediate needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two minutes later, Osborne rematerialized back at the scene of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing around, he couldn't help but be astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League was still on the back foot but had improved significantly since his departure less than a few minutes ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, over twenty new divine warriors had emerged to bolster their ranks, all of them Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really caught his attention were the power levels of these newcomers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five flames of the Divine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four flames of the Divine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five flames of the Divine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quick survey left Osborne astounded. Most of these newly-arrived gods seemed to boast a higher realm than just Intermediate Deity, many even verging on Transcendent Deity or Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet here they were, classified merely as Intermediate Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne watched the clash unfold, thoughts raced through his mind. "It seems the Pantheon League still has quite a few gods left in the tank, but they haven't awakened yet. That dozen or so Intermediate Deities should ideally have regained their strength before waking up. But given the desperate situation against the Deschanel Clan, the Pantheon League had no choice but to rouse them early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forcing their awakening will undoubtedly come at a cost&mdash;it might even mean they'll never return to their peak form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least it buys them some time to fend off the Deschanel Clan's onslaught..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He weighed his options, unsure if he should intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan may hold the advantage right now, but that doesn't mean wiping out the Pantheon League will be a walk in the park. Even if they manage it, the casualties will be staggering."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Helios, visibly strained from the battle, struck Joseph back with a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios barked, his brow furrowed with concern, "Enough already!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we keep this up, the Pantheon League will face catastrophic losses, and you won't fare any better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a chance to form an alliance, to rule this new world together. You just awakened; you don't fully grasp the lay of the land. It's not just the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League that hold power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eyes narrowed. "Is that so? Then who else counts as a power player?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios could sense a shift in Joseph's resolve, explaining, "There are at least three other factions that might wield comparable strength to ours. They could all be contenders for dominion over this new world if we weaken each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Court of the Sun, the Prophet Alliance, and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph </span><span>gasped,</span><span> his eyes wide with alarm. "The Court of the Sun?! You mean that Court of the Sun?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of fear danced in Joseph's gaze, the weight of ancient memories flooding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios chuckled, "Don't worry! That Court of the Sun has long since broken apart. It's likely that some later faction decided to pay homage by adopting that name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, the remnants of the Court are enigmatic and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why we need to call a ceasefire."</span></p><div class="pagination">
