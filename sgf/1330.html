  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While hiding in a Dimensional Microcosm can be incredibly safe, if the microcosm's vessel were discovered by enemies, it could turn into a disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most likely scenario would be that the enemy surrounded it, attacked the microcosm, or simply waited for those inside to emerge, picking them off one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a situation, the microcosm could become a dangerous trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne had to find an absolutely secure place for the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he thought of the perfect location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a place of utmost safety: the petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had already fused with Osborne's body and now resided within his heart. Osborne could place the microcosm's vessel on one of these petals, allowing the lotus to guard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, no other spot could rival this in terms of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered how Cain's fragmented soul had hidden on the Lotus' petal, eluding even the God of Night, the most powerful Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, this was undoubtedly a safe harbor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the event of Osborne's demise, the microcosm would remain shielded by the Lotus, impervious to attacks from a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, the Dimensional Microcosm could truly be considered safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already completed the fourth stage of integration with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and with the Breath of Celestial, I can manipulate the Lotus preliminarily. Placing the microcosm's vessel within its petals is entirely feasible," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this plan in mind, Osborne got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delicately placed the microcosm's vessel onto a petal of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and it was immediately enveloped in the Lotus' protective energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It worked! Now, I must create 'keys' to the microcosm, multiple copies of them, to distribute to trusted individuals like my grandfather and sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These keys will allow them to open a dimensional portal and enter the microcosm from anywhere, ensuring their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they encounter an enemy too formidable to defeat, they can quickly retreat into the microcosm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and began crafting the microcosm keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The process was simple for him, and soon, he had forged several hundred keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each key allowed entry to the microcosm, but not everyone could use them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to distribute these keys only to those he cared for and trusted the most, embedding their unique energy signatures into each key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, even if the keys were lost, they would be useless to anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, everything is ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his preparations complete, Osborne finally took a moment to pause. Nearly three days had passed, and soon, the warriors of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization would attack. He had to ensure all Augustine family members entered the microcosm promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Augustine family's temporary conference room, the family's leadership gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each person was given a key to the microcosm, their faces alight with curiosity and anticipation at the possibilities this new refuge promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian held the microcosm key in his hand, murmuring, "Is this really the key to our microcosm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We now have its own microcosm? Wonderful! Let me try it out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He infused the key with energy, and a swirling black vortex appeared in front of him. With a single step, Sebastian vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, following suit, activated their keys and entered the microcosm as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, they were astounded by the breathtaking scene surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfaction spread among everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the direction of the Augustine family's leadership, tens of thousands of family members and over 200 thousand members of the Draco Armed Services Branch entered the microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Blood Demon members joined them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having completed these arrangements, Osborne exhaled a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "At last, the safety of the Augustine family is assured! Nearly three days have passed, and the elite forces of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization should be on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final showdown is upon us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why haven't the experts from the Prophet Alliance arrived yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie from the Prophet Alliance had promised to bring their warriors within three days to support the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after their visit to the Lord League, they had not been seen again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, furrowing his brow, "Could something have gone wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter! Even if the Prophet Alliance doesn't lend a hand, I'll still crush the allied forces. Once they're defeated, nothing on Blue Planet will threaten me again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having resolved to face the impending battle, Osborne waited quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, he felt a surge of powerful energy waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up. "Have they finally arrived?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
