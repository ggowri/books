  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, her brow furrowing in concern, "The second thing is quite strange!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as you were chasing after Maddox and leaving </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, all forty-two of the divine peaks suddenly collapsed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the divine peaks crumbled, I picked up on an incredibly intense energy signal. It was even more powerful than the energy radiating from Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was like a fleeting spark. By the time I rushed over to check it out, there was nothing to be found. Those divine peaks just came crashing down out of the blue..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face underwent a drastic change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All forty-two divine peaks have collapsed? And Isa has detected an energy force that outmatched Lord Malevolence's?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a name popped into his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Creation Herald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Could he be the mastermind behind this? Is the Creation Herald still alive?!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the old days, these divine peaks didn't exist on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only came into being after Lord Malevolence's invasion. A monumental battle between him and the God of Night shook the planet to its core, reshaping the landscape and giving birth to these imposing formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, they seemed nothing more than unusually tall mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But everything took a turn five hundred years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an enigmatic and formidable force cloaked the peaks, rendering the rocks almost impervious. Even a Deity King warrior would find it an uphill battle to chip off a single piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the moment when the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> made their first appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> grew in strength, they devoured countless humans, forcing the survivors to take refuge within the fortified walls of their cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, they even managed to locate the sealed place where Lord Malevolence was imprisoned and shattered the barriers holding him captive, setting him free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lord Malevolence who bestowed the name "divine peaks" upon these formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All forty-two of them have collapsed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown deepened as a sense of unease welled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go and check it out!" he said, his voice filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum sprang into action, racing towards the nearest divine peak. As they drew closer, Osborne witnessed the once-glorious peak reduced to a pile of rubble. All its former power had vanished, leaving behind a desolate expanse of broken rocks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye scanned the area, and he realized that all the Celestial Crystals, Miracle Elixirs, and other precious treasures that once dotted the divine peaks had completely disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if someone had conducted a thorough and meticulous raid, leaving not a single thing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew even gloomier, but he held his tongue and moved on to inspect the other divine peaks. Each one had met the same dismal fate; their resources had been ransacked to the last bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did he stop, his face contorted with a mix of anger and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It has to be the Creation Herald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't believe he's still alive! And it seems his power has fully recovered! The energy signature </span><span>that </span><span>Isa felt, which was stronger than Lord Malevolence's, must have been his! After all, he was the one who had control over the divine peaks. But why did he choose to strike while I was away, busy chasing Maddox, and make off with the Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he afraid that I'll go after him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If so... he must have been lurking in the shadows, watching my battle with Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That means... the Creation Herald knows I have the Sacred Artifact palace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his head, Osborne's expression grew even more solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on?" Isa asked, taking his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern was clearly written all over her face as she noticed his deepening frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. He figured there was no use in keeping anything from Isa and the others, so he promptly voiced his suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Creation Herald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the atmosphere grew tense. The girls' faces turned </span><span>solemn,</span><span> their brows furrowed with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know about the Creation Herald!" the God of Light said, her voice calm but laced with unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to </span><span>her,</span><span> his eyes filled with eagerness for more details. "God of Light, please&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She interrupted, a fleeting smile softening her serious expression, "Your Majesty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to address me as the God of Light anymore. You're the reincarnation of the God of Night, and I'm merely your maid. Just call me Anita.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, I'd love it if you called me Annie like you used to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita's cheeks flushed a little as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of awkwardness washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often forgot that he was the reincarnation of the God of Night and that Anita was his attendant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name "Annie" felt foreign on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, without a single shred of the God of Night's memories in his mind, it was an uphill battle for him to come to terms with this supposed connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne held his tongue and gave the God of Light a nod. "Okay then, from now on, I'll just call you Anita!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita's face fell slightly at Osborne's hesitation, but she quickly regained her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Your Majesty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cut her off and forced a smile. "Drop the 'Your Majesty'. Just call me Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita wavered for a second before giving a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I do have some knowledge about the Creation Herald. The God of Night once told me that the Creation Herald is actually a splinter of consciousness from an almighty warrior called the Creator Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Creation Herald is incredibly powerful! The God of Night said that if it weren't for a tree that trapped him, Lord Malevolence wouldn't have stood a chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without that tree, the Creation Herald would have long since taken over </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, and Lord Malevolence would never have had the opportunity to gain a foothold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Osborne's expression had turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already knew that the Creation Herald was a fragment of the Creator Deity's consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald himself had disclosed that to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also knew that the Eighth World Tree offshoot had held the Creation Herald captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was he who had eliminated that offshoot, setting the Creation Herald free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of this realization bore down on him. He had unwittingly helped the Creation Herald regain his freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita sensed the change in Osborne's mood and continued earnestly, "Osborne, I don't know much about the Creation Herald as I've never met him in person. Most of what I know is from casual conversations with the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I believe it's time for you to integrate the memories of the God of Night. Whether you're ready to accept it or not, you are truly his reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your past </span><span>self had</span><span> interactions with the Creation Herald. Once you merge those memories, you'll understand him far better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell into silence, deep in thought about Anita's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intentionally steered clear of the topic of the God of Night's memories because he hadn't fully come to terms with the fact that he was the reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was anxious about the potential consequences of merging those memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Will it alter my personality?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Will I end up like Ophelia, whose consciousness was overtaken by that of the God of Time after retrieving those memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if the awareness of the God of Night seals away my own consciousness?</span></p><div class="pagination">
