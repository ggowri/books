  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, he sneered at Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What </span><span>Ian </span><span>had done&mdash;</span><span>peeking at Elisha </span><span>while she bathed</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>was neither </span><span>a rumor or a guess. </span><span> On the contrary, Osborne accidentally overheard this matter in the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent </span><span>had once coveted</span><span> Elisha's beauty at the time. After all, Elisha was one of the three beauties of the Glorious Divine Kingdom back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to the Crown Prince's authority and strength, Brent didn't dare do anything to Elisha. In the end, he couldn't resist and took a Sacred Artifact from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury that could conceal </span><span>his presence</span><span> and body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When</span><span> the Crown Prince</span><span> was absent</span><span> from the palace, Brent had Ian sneak into Elisha's residence and secretly film her bathing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Th</span><span>e video</span><span> ultimately ended up in Brent's hands. He watched </span><span>it</span><span> repeatedly and carefully hid them away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One </span><span>day</span><span>, when Brent returned from a state banquet drunk, he hazily </span><span>stirred</span><span> trouble for Osborne. Together with Ian, he brutally beat and humiliated Osborne. Then, they just left like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was furious. </span><span>As </span><span>Brent</span><span> was in a </span><span>weakened state due to drunkenness, he planned to secretly follow him and look for an opportunity to take revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he unexpectedly discovered something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The video of Elisha bathing, which Brent had hidden, was stolen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent was furious and sobered up immediately. He sent Ian to investigate, but Ian found nothing. Osborne, not wanting </span><span>to cause </span><span>trouble, took the opportunity to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Osborne intended to use this leverage to take revenge on Brent</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>ut before he could bring it up, his mother had an accident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne's mother was executed, Osborne was soon expelled from the royal family and the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Fleeing from those hunting him, he left the Racial Convergence Planet and went into hiding on Celestara Planet...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Memories of these events flashed through Osborne's mind, and his gaze turned icy cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, </span><span>as he </span><span>look</span><span>ed</span><span> at Ian, Osborne's eyes were full of menace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Ian </span><span>wa</span><span>s still alive, it mean</span><span>t</span><span> his secret ha</span><span>d</span><span>n't been exposed yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could completely use this to threaten Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian felt very flustered, his face full of fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly said through Telepathy, "Was it your friend who stole the video over a thousand years ago? What exactly are you trying to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "We don't want to do anything. We're just enjoying it! Otherwise, over a thousand years, so why hasn't this been exposed yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't want to use this to threaten you, nor have I ever thought of targeting Prince Brent. But if you want to kill me and Leroy, don't blame me for being ruthless. As soon as we're dead, my friend will definitely release the video for everyone to see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, you know best what the consequences will be!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian's forehead was covered in cold sweat, and he struggled to keep his body from trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He certainly knew the consequences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The current Crown Prince </span><span>wa</span><span>s even more assertive and domineering than</span><span> he was</span><span> a thousand years ago, and his power </span><span>rivaled that of</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>he Glorious Divine Emperor. He ha</span><span>d</span><span> a great chance of becoming the next Emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elisha </span><span>wa</span><span>s still the Crown Prince's favorite consort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, if Ian's secretly filmed video of Princess Elisha bathing got out, he would be doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was as good as dead</span><span>, as the Crown Prince would surely make him wish for death over life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brent, along with his family, friends, everyone connected to him, and everyone he care</span><span>d</span><span> about, would all be doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, Ian was no longer arrogant, and his killing intent had vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even humbly said through Telepathy, "Osborne, I was wrong! I promise I will never target or retaliate against you again. Please, no matter what, </span><span>tell</span><span> your friend not to act impulsively!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>T</span><span>hat won't benefit anyone, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, your friend has also seen that video and admired Princess Elisha's stunning figure. If the Crown Prince finds out, he definitely won't spare your friend!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the Crown Prince's current power and status, no matter how strong your friend is, he will surely die. There will be no place for you in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom or even the entire Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, keeping it a secret is good for everyone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking </span><span>in such a humble manner</span><span>, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and said calmly, "Of course, I'm not that foolish. Unless absolutely necessary, I won't let my friend reveal the secret!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But </span><span>that depends on how you act</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian quickly said, "Don't worry. I swear I will never retaliate against you. If you ever have any trouble, you can always come to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "It's settled then! If I need your help in the future, don't you dare refuse me, or else..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian smirked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne exchanged a few more words with Ian before ending their telepathy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their telepathy exchange didn't last long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the onlookers were still mockingly </span><span>looking at</span><span> Osborne, as if they were observing a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne offended the royal member Ian, so everyone thought Osborne and Leroy were doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Ian said, "I thought about it. Among the resources submitted by Leroy, the Ice Beetles' corpses are not a problem. After all, Ice Beetles can die naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy was just lucky to find </span><span>so </span><span>many naturally dead Ice Beetles, but this doesn't prove Leroy cheated!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, </span><span>all these can be used</span><span> to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints </span><span>legitimately</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian finished speaking, and everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Ian in disbelief</span><span>. </span><span>Ian was insulted by Leroy, </span><span>and </span><span>scolded by Osborne, yet he suppressed his anger like this? And he even willingly admitted that Leroy didn't cheat...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Are the laws of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and the ancestral teachings of the Augustine family really that effective?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked, </span><span>especially</span><span> Brenda; she couldn't accept such a result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Leroy didn't cheat, the resources she submitted could exchange for at least three to four times Brenda's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The championship would no longer belong to Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! I can't accept this!" Brenda shouted angrily. "Leroy obviously cheated. How can these Ice Beetle corpses count? Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda immediately felt a cold and terrifying gaze fall upon her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, are you questioning me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian said coldly, "Do you think what I did was unfair? Are you implying that I'm </span><span>covering for </span><span>Leroy? Look into my eyes and tell me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Brenda trembled all over. She couldn't help but notice </span><span>that </span><span>Ian's eyes </span><span>were </span><span>filled with endless fury and killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was instantly terrified, her body trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did my words offend Ian?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why does Ian have such intense killing intent toward me?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda felt terrified and dared not speak again. Instead, she bowed respectfully to Ian and apologized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Ian didn't continue to make things difficult for Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian said calmly, "</span><span>I have calculated. T</span><span>hese resources can be exchanged for three billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the leaderboard in mid-air changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's name appeared at the top, surpassing Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the current leaderboard, everyone around was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda was no longer the champion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That&rsquo;s three billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><div class="pagination">
