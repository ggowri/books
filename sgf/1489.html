  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprise lit up Osborne's face as he absorbed the results of his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enhancement of his lightning elemental essence through the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity exceeded his wildest expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had anticipated that consuming one core would only elevate his lightning elemental essence from Level Four to the mid or late stages of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his previous experiences with spatial and dark power essences, that seemed reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the outcome was astonishing. After fully absorbing the core energy, his lightning elemental essence soared straight to the peak of Level Five, tantalizingly close to breaking into Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "If I had a bit more time, I bet I could push my lightning elemental essence into Level Six without needing another core. Just relying on my own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was this boost so significant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that my lightning elemental essence isn't as powerful as the spatial or dark essences? So, using the same core energy resulted in a greater enhancement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Power levels varied; spatial and dark powers were incredibly potent and rare, while Thunder Power, despite its reputation for sheer attack strength, paled in comparison when matched against those.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, that was how Osborne saw it. To him, Thunder Power felt like just another elemental force, nowhere near as formidable as spatial or dark powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn't have abandoned Thunder Power to focus on mastering spatial and dark powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne's Thunder Power, though mutated, paled in comparison to the might of space and dark powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad my lightning elemental essence is just shy of breaking into Level Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only I had that extra edge, I'd feel much more confident taking on Fabian. Still, the peak of Level Five should suffice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when I first broke through Level Five with Thunder Power, it unlocked two brand new techniques for me&mdash;Judgment Thunder Drake and Thunderform Flash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed the intricacies of using Judgment Thunder Drake and Thunderform Flash in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judgment Thunder Drake was an incredibly aggressive attack move, an upgraded version of the Thunder of Judgment. It could summon an endless torrent of lightning to form a thunder dragon that would charge at enemies, delivering not only immense penetration power but also explosive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength and the peak of Level Five lightning elemental essence, casting Judgment Thunder Drake would likely leave any typical Celestial Deity warrior either dead or severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, against a Deity Overlord like Fabian, it wouldn't be enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't expect to defeat Fabian outright; his goal was simply to keep Fabian occupied, to be a thorn in his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was where Thunderform Flash came into play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This technique allowed Osborne to coat his Divine Body with lightning, significantly boosting his defenses. More importantly, it transformed his body into a bolt of lightning, granting him terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunderform Flash will give me the edge I need! My speed should rival any Celestial Deity warrior who specializes in agility. And that's exactly where Fabian falls short; even as a Deity Overlord, he'll struggle to keep up with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, without resorting to my hidden cards like space, dark, and time power, I finally have the capability to clash head-on with Fabian."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne dove back into his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the secret chamber, where time accelerated a hundredfold, he quickly mastered Thunderform Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, a flash of lightning zipped through the spacious chamber, darting left and right so swiftly that it was nearly impossible to follow with the naked eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the lightning finally came to a halt, it revealed Osborne, surrounded by dark purple arcs of electricity, embodying the essence of a war god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, a grin spreading across his face, "I've finally got it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this is just the beginning. If I can push Thunderform Flash to initiate mastery level, mastery level, or even refined level, my speed will skyrocket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are still forty minutes until the slave market closes. I'll dedicate thirty minutes to honing Thunderform Flash. In here, that's equivalent to five hours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hopefully, I can elevate it to the initiate level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, he sprang back into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, a streak of lightning zipped around the chamber, its speed increasing with every passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, five hours had flown by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne came to a halt, satisfaction and confidence radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was proud of his talent; in just five hours, he had advanced Thunderform Flash from a novice level to initiate mastery, doubling his speed in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he felt ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Time to face the world! Betty, Darren, and the others must be anxiously waiting for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to confront Fabian and the other factions. Today marks the first step for me and Spark of Blaze to rise in Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne gathered his divine power defenses, slowly opening the door to the chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he stepped outside, countless eyes turned toward him, curiosity and anticipation shimmering in their gazes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
