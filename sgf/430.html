  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, there's actually a reward!" Osborne was surprised. "Looks like all three tasks in the Fifth Heir trial come with a prize. Just don't know what this one will be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Draco Star Wristlet remained unresponsive, still showing "reward preparation in progress".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe the Godfather isn't ready yet? Maybe he didn't expect me to uncover the mole in the Augustine family so quickly and complete the task?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever, it's my reward. I'll get it sooner or later. Just leave it for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't foolishly wait around for the rewards to be handed out. Instead, he pulled out blood diamonds from the Dimensional Space, absorbing their energy to cultivate while also planning his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants' assault had ended in disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been decisively defeated, losing several Class A masters in the process. The survivors had fled in disarray and were unlikely to return to the auction house anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, during the battle, Osborne had come perilously close to death on multiple occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time was at the hands of Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Serena hadn't intervened at the last moment, Bruce's cane would have pierced his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second time was against Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Bryce hadn't arrived just in the nick of time, Osborne would have been captured alive by Chris, likely to be taken to the Aberrants' stronghold and transformed into a weapon by the King of the Aberrants, specifically to be used against the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Bruce or Chris, they were both at a Class AA level, far beyond Osborne's current ability to contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Face to face, he wouldn't stand a chance, not even to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them could easily interrupt his interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, I'm just not strong enough. I'm still stuck at Class B+, and the gap between me and Bruce, Chris, is too vast. All my techniques are useless against them. I can't even run for my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could break through to become a Class A Power Master, even if I'm still not their match, at least they wouldn't be able to stop me from escaping, no matter how hard they try to interrupt my interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I must break through as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Maritime Auction is set to be a resounding success. The Augustine family's cruise line is now under Bryce's protection, ensuring that no one will dare to target their ships in these waters again. The family business is finally back on track, stronger than ever," he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things keep going like this, the Augustines will rise to the top again. But becoming one of the three most powerful families in Dampston won't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, we don't necessarily have to build our own power to get there. If we take out the top families... The Augustines will naturally become one of the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The leading families - the Paltrows, the Luthers, the Walkers, as well as the Marions and the Byrons - they're all connected to the Aberrants! The third phase of the heir's trial requires me to eliminate all of their top members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, even if they don't face total ruin, the Augustines are sure to overtake them. If the Augustines get their hands on their assets and businesses, they could easily become the top dog among Dampston's ancient families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, as long as I nail the third task of the heir's challenge, the second will fall into place. Wait... Does this count as taking a shortcut?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of ruthlessness flashed in Osborne's eyes as he pondered this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current strength, I can't take on all five old families at once. I need to prioritize. The Paltrows are first on my hit list!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander and Clarissa's wedding is only days away! That's when I'll make my move against the Paltrows. I'll crash that ceremony and steal Clarissa away myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I should take this opportunity to eliminate the top brass of the Paltrow family! But I'm not strong enough yet." Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure if the Paltrow family had any Class AA experts. If they did, crashing their wedding with his current power would be a suicide mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he doubted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strongest among the Paltrow family should be Wade, and then there's Alexander, who has stabilized his level and absorbed the Blessing of Thunder. Neither of them can be underestimated. Even dealing with just the two of them would be a challenge for me right now. I need to get stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I break through and become a Class A Power Master in just a few days?" Osborne wasn't confident about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Isa's my only hope! If I can't break through to Class A Power Master, I'll have to rely on my martial arts skills to face the Paltrow family head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I haven't mastered enough advanced techniques. Spiral Force alone won't be enough against the Paltrows. I need to find Isa and learn more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne stood up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction wasn't until tomorrow, but the threat was gone, and Osborne didn't want to waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to head back to Pinchide City to find Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking care of a few things, Osborne left that very night. By daybreak, he was back in Pinchide City, standing before Isa's opulent mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne keyed in the code and entered the mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he was greeted by Isa's strikingly beautiful face.</span></p><div class="pagination">
