  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!" Osborne exclaimed, utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes had been quietly residing in his Dimensional Space, silently consuming and breaking down the energy from Sacred Crystals to aid in his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why had it suddenly appeared, and of its own accord, no less?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be... for the Radiant Golden Ore?" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes was a mystical technique he had acquired when Satan's Eye broke through to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its power was directly tied to the strength of Satan's Eye&mdash;the stronger the latter, the more formidable the former became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Satan's Eye displayed a keen interest in the Radiant Golden Ore, it seemed unable to absorb it directly. "Is it asking for the Infinite Devouring Eyes to help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne sent the Radiant Golden Ore soaring toward Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, an immense force of suction erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Radiant Golden Ore instantly merged into the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal eye flickered with a soft golden glow for a brief moment before falling silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did it really absorb it?" Osborne stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after absorbing the Radiant Golden Ore, the Infinite Devouring Eyes showed no further signs of change. Osborne felt no difference in his Satan's Eye compared to before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned in frustration, thinking, "Was that it? Maybe it's because one Radiant Golden Ore isn't enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it needs more to trigger a change in the Infinite Devouring Eyes or Satan's Eye?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne pulled out all the Radiant Golden Ore he had collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Radiant Golden Ore was like the eyes of the Mud Golem; he had defeated twenty-eight of them and gathered a total of fifty-six pieces, all of which were now in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, the Infinite Devouring Eyes unleashed a powerful force, drawing all the Radiant Golden Ore toward it</span><span> and</span><span> merging them into its depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a brilliant golden light erupted from the Infinite Devouring Eyes, transforming its previously dark and ominous appearance into something almost sacred, bathed in a soft golden hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne suddenly felt his Satan's Eye begin to throb violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense pulsations shocked him, as if his eyeball might pop right out of its socket. A trickle of blood tears unexpectedly streamed from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?! Is the Radiant Golden Ore toxic?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford for Satan's Eye to malfunction. A significant part of his success stemmed from its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Satan's Eye, he might have remained an inconspicuous ordinary man on Blue Planet, thrown out of the Caldwell family after his divorce from Ophelia, never to rise </span><span>again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Satan's Eye that had brought him to this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, without Satan's Eye, Osborne was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, still one of the top warriors in this cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was unwilling to lose Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other abilities were manageable, but the super vision and X-ray vision granted by Satan's Eye were irreplaceable. Losing them would be a significant blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ability actively consumed and broke down energy, allowing Osborne to elevate his cultivation level without wasting countless hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, he might still be just an ordinary Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Osborne could not let anything happen to Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the abnormal activity of Satan's Eye caused him to panic, he forced himself to calm down and began to carefully sense the changes occurring within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent pulsations of Satan's Eye sent sharp pangs of pain through Osborne, but he hardly noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, a look of delight spread across his face as he sensed something incredible&mdash;with each beat, Satan's Eye was growing stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having already reached the pinnacle of Level Ten, it had been a long time since Satan's Eye had experienced any improvement. However, after absorbing fifty-six pieces of Radiant Golden Ore through the Infinite Devouring Eyes, it was slowly becoming even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most immediate change was in its X-ray vision ability, which was rapidly enhancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, even at full strength, Osborne could only see 16 feet deep into the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything beyond that was a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his X-ray vision was being enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne focused on the marsh, he could see much deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Satan's Eye was able to penetrate down to thirty-three feet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant his X-ray vision had effectively doubled in range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the enhancement didn't stop there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Satan's Eye improving, but so was the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside it were twelve Sacred Crystals, which it had been tirelessly working to break down, aiding Osborne in raising his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy contained within a Sacred Crystal was immense, and even the Infinite Devouring Eyes needed time to completely absorb and decompose it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed at which it could break down energy was limited, but now, Osborne sensed that this rate was rapidly increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, it took him ten days to decompose the energy from a single Sacred Crystal. Now, that time had been cut in half&mdash;just five days to fully break down one Sacred Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Osborne's cultivation level was also set to rise at double the speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the best part? This enhancement wasn't finished yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of joy, thinking, "The Radiant Golden Ore truly works on Satan's Eye! It's leveling up again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Satan's Eye, already at Level Ten, is on the brink of becoming... Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Satan's Eye at Sacredness Level?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was bubbling with anticipation, but he knew that fifty-six pieces of Radiant Golden Ore wouldn't be enough to push Satan's Eye past its limits into Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Level Ten and Sacredness Level was vast, filled with challenges that made breaking through incredibly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet at this moment, Osborne felt a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need a massive amount of Radiant Golden Ore!" he thought, excitement coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy from the fifty-six pieces was being consumed rapidly, and the pulsations of Satan's Eye began to slow, indicating that the enhancement was nearing its end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having tasted the thrill of rapid improvement, he was eager to push Satan's Eye to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The advantages that would come with it were undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the changes in Satan's Eye came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to before, its X-ray vision ability had tripled. It was now capable of seeing down to sixty-six feet into the Corrosive Marsh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes had also tripled its energy decomposition speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt he was on the cusp of breaking through to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he opened his eyes, a spark of determination flashed within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Radiant Golden Ore must be a unique treasure of Umbra Earth! I need to gather as much as I can to help Satan's Eye complete its transformation into Sacredness Level! If I miss this chance, who knows when I'll get another opportunity?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
