  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan felt as if the sky were collapsing around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had sacrificed herself in a battle against the Dark Deity Legion years ago, leaving Seth as his only pillar of support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, in a desperate bid to save the Hudson family's heir and prodigy, Virgil, Seth had chosen to forfeit his own life by giving away the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan understood that his father's decision was meant for the greater good of the family, but accepting it was another matter entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth sighed deeply, "Ah! Tristan, you've grown up. When I'm gone, you need to take care of yourself and protect the Hudson family. It's the duty of every member of our clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must also safeguard the West Zone, the last bastion of the Human Community. This is our responsibility!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't be around to protect you anymore, so you need to be strong. Don't let your old man down..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Seth spoke, his complexion turned ashen, his vitality waning rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! What's happening? Don't scare me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth forced a smile. "Tristan, I'm nearing the end of my road. But I have no regrets. I hope you won't harbor any resentment toward the family. The white Miracle Elixir was my choice to give to save Virgil, not something he coerced me into!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's tears flowed more freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, please don't talk like that! Hold on! There's still a chance! Just hang in there! The family is searching everywhere for another white Miracle Elixir. If you can just hold on a bit longer, you'll pull through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth shook his head slowly. "I know my situation better than anyone. My time is short. I just want to talk to you one last time..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's heart shattered at his father's words, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his wrist terminal buzzed to life, a call from the guard at the estate gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan hesitated. All he wanted was to stay by his father's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Seth, with great effort, urged him, "Tristan, answer it! The guard wouldn't contact you unless it was important. Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere just yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting his lip, Tristan reluctantly accepted the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression shifted to one of shock as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore Augustine? Yes, he's definitely my friend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, tell him to wait a moment. I have a few things to wrap up before I come to see him. Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ended the call and turned back to his father, only to find Seth staring at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore Augustine?! You just said 'Theodore'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan, confused by his father's reaction, nodded. "Yes! Dad, I just met Theodore today! At the Miracle Elixir auction at the Luminous Commerce Center, he helped me buy the white Miracle Elixir at a much lower price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you didn't get to use it in the end, I still owe him a favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he noticed Seth had gone completely still, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped Tristan. "Dad, what's wrong? Don't scare me! You have to hang on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth snapped back to reality, urgency in his voice. "Tristan, tell me&mdash;what does Theodore look like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan furrowed his brow, puzzled by his father's concern for Theodore in such dire circumstances. But he didn't want to go against Seth's wishes and described "Theodore".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him! It's really him!" Seth murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's going on? What about Theodore? Do you know him?" Tristan asked, curiosity mingling with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's expression hardened, fury gleaming in his eyes. "Of course, I know him! How could I not? Theodore has shown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry! Get him inside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to see him before... before it's too late! I need to find out what he did with my sister! Quick, get him in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth coughed violently, urgency dripping from his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's heart raced. He was completely in the dark but sensed the gravity of the situation from his father's agitation. "Dad, please calm down! I'll fetch Theodore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get me Theodore! I'll be okay," Seth gasped, his breathing ragged. With Tristan's soothing words, he seemed to stabilize, but the intensity of his demand remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Tristan gritted his teeth and dashed out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne, waiting patiently after receiving a message, raised an eyebrow as he noticed Tristan barreling toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, we've got to get you inside. My dad wants to see you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan urged, grabbing Osborne's arm and pulling him along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Tristan, bewildered by his frantic demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt off&mdash;the redness in Tristan's eyes was a clear sign of recent tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't dwell on it. Instead, he hurried along behind him, curious yet cautious about what awaited him in the villa belonged to Tristan and Seth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
