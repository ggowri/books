  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swore that if it weren't for Divine Shadow's sudden blush when she mentioned his grandfather, Sebastian, he would never have considered calling her "Grandma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could possibly bring themselves to call a girl who looked barely in her twenties "Grandma"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Divine Shadow was ancient&mdash;she had existed since the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had awakened centuries ago, long before Osborne was even a thought. In fact, she was old enough to be his grandmother's grandmother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good boy," Divine Shadow said with a warm smile, looking at Osborne as if she were a doting elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The affection in her gaze left him feeling utterly bemused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila giggled, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Ms. Divine Shadow, if Osborne's calling you Grandma, does that mean I should too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow chuckled, gently ruffling Mila's hair. "Oh, no way! That would make me feel ancient! I'm still so young!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only shake his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll keep our titles separate," Divine Shadow added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then looked at Osborne. "Listen here, kiddo. No matter what, I owe you a huge thanks for rescuing the Sublime Saintess! You've brought us back together! Damn that Deschanel family from Hearin City! They're the same bunch from the Age of Gods, and I swear, I'll take them down one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a fierce aura radiated from Divine Shadow, her rage palpable. Osborne felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma... Divine Shadow, you want to go after the Deschanel family? You can't act on impulse! They've got thirty-six awakened deities on their side, and their strength is no joke. The weakest among them is an Intermediate Deity, with some even being Superior Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow met his gaze with calm determination. "You think I can't handle it? So, what if they're Superior Deities? They can be killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a wave of terrifying power erupted from Divine Shadow, and in that instant, Osborne looked up and saw it&mdash;Divine Flame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames erupted above her head in a dazzling display, crackling and shimmering into existence out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six brilliant flames appeared above her head, flickering with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, two were dim, while four blazed fiercely, exuding an incredibly rich blue light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity Overlord! Level Six Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, and his eyes wide with disbelief as he took in the sight above Divine Shadow's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Just moments ago, there was no Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did it suddenly manifest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as I suspected, Divine Shadow was indeed once a Deity Overlord warrior. Although she hasn't fully recovered her strength, she's still at the level of a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the first warrior I've ever encountered with such power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow smiled, "For reasons I don't fully understand, I awakened earlier than expected. I came back before the energies of the world had fully restored. My recovery was slow back then, but I've been awake for hundreds of years longer than those deities from the Deschanel family! Now, my strength has returned to the level of a Transcendent Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled sharply, a wave of excitement washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Divine Shadow actually possesses Transcendent Deity-level power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppose he had known that sooner, he wouldn't have had to risk everything to steal the Sanctuary Casket from the Deschanel family's hideout, only to pin the blame on the League of Divine Descent. That ploy had stirred up a hornet's nest, pitting the Deschanel family against the League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deschanel family dared to mess with the Augustine family, he could have simply let Divine Shadow wipe them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, that would have meant he wouldn't have been able to rescue Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saving her, Divine Shadow would likely remain in her feline disguise, never revealing her true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all part of fate's twisted design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What weighed heavily on his mind was whether Divine Shadow could truly take down the Deschanel family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had thirty-six awakened deities, and while none were at the Transcendent Deity level, there were still six Superior Deities and thirty Intermediate Deities among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could a single Transcendent Deity really handle six Superior Deities and thirty Intermediate Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver down his spine; it was risky, to say the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there were still sixty-three deities sleeping within the Sanctuary Casket. Even if they weren't fully restored yet, if the Deschanel family found themselves in a life-or-death situation, they could very well awaken those slumbering gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be no easy feat for Divine Shadow to take down the Deschanel family alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his scheme to frame the League of Divine Descent and let them and the Deschanel family tear each other apart was indeed the right move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ideally, Osborne could set them up for a mutually assured destruction. Then, he'd join forces with Divine Shadow to eliminate the remnants once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his plan fully formed, Osborne eagerly shared it with Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Divine Shadow nodded, a glint of approval in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's no wonder your grandfather has such high hopes for you! You're sharp, and your plan is solid. I'll admit, it would be tough for me to take down the Deschanel family on my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go with your plan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all need to strengthen your abilities first. When it's time to strike, come find me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart soared at her words. "Absolutely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was reveling in their newfound alliance, he noticed the Divine Flame above Divine Shadow's head flicker and disappeared once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, why did your Divine Flame vanish?" he blurted out, unable to contain his curiosity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
