  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, the border competition is about to start. Are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light ignored the crowd's confusion and shock, offering no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid no attention to the crowd either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded calmly. "Of course. I've been waiting for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Let's head out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light said this and strode outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Anastasia, and the others followed closely behind her. Soon, they arrived at the Sanctum of Light's platform, overlooking the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot where Osborne and his group stood had originally been reserved for Julian, Tanner, and other Human Community leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces looked sour now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were desperate to know Osborne's identity, but since God of Light said nothing, they didn't dare ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looks like these people will be on the stage soon. Are they from the Demon Slayer group? Let's see what makes them so special," Julian thought coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's massive projection appeared in the void, his gaze locked onto God of Light and her group. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, the third day of the border competition is about to begin. Don't tell me your Human Community is going to be crushed again? The last two days were so dull&mdash;we barely put in any effort, and you fell apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One finished speaking, his eyes gleaming with mockery as he taunted God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light scoffed. "Icy One, don't be so arrogant! We weren't serious the past two days. Today, we'll give you a real surprise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One burst out laughing. "God of Light, didn't you say the same thing yesterday? And what happened? One win, seven losses. Disappointing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's see about that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light didn't bother to continue. After all, the Human Community's performance over the last two days had been dismal. No matter what she said, it would come off as hollow bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light spoke coldly, her eagerness evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One glanced at God of Light, slightly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had suffered humiliating defeats the past two days, yet God of Light seemed unshaken. On the third day, she appeared... different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed more confident than she had been the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave Icy One a sense of foreboding, but he quickly dismissed it. With such a wide gap in power, he doubted the Human Community could pose a real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At best, if they were serious, the Human Community might win one or two rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, he sneered. "Since you're so eager to lose again, I'll gladly oblige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's projection vanished. At the same time, from the Dark Deity Legion's camp emerged ten thousand peak Transcendent Deity warriors from the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to look and immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! There are so many prodigies from the top ten Upper Races in there! And even some geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan! This is trouble. Winning just got even harder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just hope we don't lose too badly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Human Community's factions whispered among themselves. Seeing the enemy's lineup, their already fragile confidence crumbled further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were certain&mdash;this match was lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, God of Light remained utterly calm. She waved her hand, and immediately, a group of ten thousand warriors stepped forward. They were all dressed in the robes of the Sanctum of Light and wore masks as they silently ascended to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing these people, the crowd was once again stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such powerful auras!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an elite group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you see how their auras are faintly connected? This means their teamwork must be incredible&mdash;flawlessly in sync!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, who are they?" someone couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light replied indifferently, "They are the reserve team of the Sanctum of Light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She offered no further explanation, though a faint glimmer of reluctance flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne curiously studied the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured softly, "Training a group like this can't have been easy. Sending them to the arena... if they all die, wouldn't it be a waste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, God of Light looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a shame. But to secure victory and restore morale for the Human Alliance, such sacrifices are necessary!" she said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, her gaze hardened with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over the last two days, the factions have lost many of their own prodigies. If their geniuses can sacrifice themselves, so can those from the Sanctum of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, a wave of emotion rising in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had been able to resist the Dark Deity Legion for a thousand years because there was always a group of people willing to sacrifice themselves. Without them, they would have long been enslaved by the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, "They don't actually need to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne activated&nbsp;Absolute Guardianship, instantly duplicating the life essence of all ten thousand Sanctum of Light prodigies on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they all fell in the arena, Osborne would be able to bring them back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light didn't notice Osborne's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the first battle of the third day began. The Dark Deity Legion unleashed an earth-shaking battle cry, filling the sky with a menacing, bloodthirsty energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Unity Clan's prodigies on the arena seemed to draw strength from the roar, surging forward with unstoppable momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light's elite prodigies immediately displayed incredible strength and coordination. Unlike the previous two days, their confidence remained unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they gained the upper hand in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Unity Clan had sent more Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses this time, along with those from the top ten Upper Races, they still couldn't match the Sanctum of Light's elite prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the arena was littered with heavy casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the fallen were both Unity Clan and Human Community fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brutality of the competition unfolded once more, but this time, it was the Human Community who held the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the final enemy collapsing, the first match of the Transcendent Deity-level competition came to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite prodigies of the Sanctum of Light wiped out the enemy at the cost of over six thousand lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had won the first battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victory sent waves of excitement through the Human Community. While they had managed a single win in the previous two days, those victories had been painfully hard-fought, with less than a tenth of their fighters surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, they had secured a decisive victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over three thousand of their fighters had survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the Human Alliance couldn't hold back and shouted loudly, releasing the frustration of the past two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, many others remained solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only one victory. What was there to celebrate? There were still seven matches to go, and if they lost the rest, it would be no different from the previous days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, I didn't expect you to send out the Sanctum of Light's elite prodigies! So many of them dead&mdash;surely you must be heartbroken. Was it really worth it for a single win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light snorted coldly at the comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save your breath! Let's move to the next round. I told you, today will bring you a huge surprise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready to be crushed!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
