  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it just be a gun?" Osborne was puzzled. Given his current strength, any gun was nothing more than a toy to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most powerful gun from the Draco Group no longer impressed him. With his abilities now, he could exert more force with a mere flick of his finger than any firearm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't used a gun in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True masters didn't need guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why was a gun the reward for the first task?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened the box and found that it indeed contained a gun. And it was just a handgun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was slightly larger than a typical handgun, it was still the least powerful firearm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head and was about to put it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of toy was of no use to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Isa spoke up. "I've already checked it out. It's not just a handgun. You can think of it as a magic weapon created with modern technology."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Not a handgun, but a magic weapon?" Osborne was surprised and quickly grabbed it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a magic weapon, now he was interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Yeah, you could call it a magic weapon, but it's a new kind, built with technology. It's quite something. With your current abilities, it'd be perfect for you to have some fun with. It doesn't shoot bullets. It shoots energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you channel energy into it, the weapon compresses that energy, amplifies its power, and then blasts it out at your enemies. It also incorporates some techniques from Point Blank Force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, Osborne's curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with time running out, Osborne didn't have a chance to test it. He quickly stored it in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll try it out when I get the chance!" he said. "For now, I need to head to the Paltrow Estate immediately. Isa, thank you for everything you've done for me during this time. It must have been exhausting for you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne gently caressed Isa's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was pale and drawn. It was clear that helping Osborne break through to Class A had been incredibly difficult, even for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compressing the soul of powers had taken every ounce of Isa's strength. Without her unwavering dedication, there was no way she could have condensed his soul of powers into a single eyeball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the fatigue etched on Isa's delicate face, Osborne felt a pang of heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa brushed his hand away without hesitation, her voice cold. "Save the sentimentality. Hurry up and go rescue your girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "Actually, you've got it all wrong. Clarissa isn't just my girlfriend. Technically, she's my partner. You, on the other hand, are the side piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Isa's expression turn icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded coldly, "You dare call me the side piece? I'll go kill your girlfriend right now, and you won't even get to say goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face immediately stiffened, and he quickly raised his hands in surrender. "Alright, alright, I was wrong, okay? You're my partner, and she's the girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne suddenly grabbed Isa's face and kissed her passionately. "No matter what, thank you for helping me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't worry, I always keep my promises. If you ever need my help, I swear on my life I'll be there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne casually tore open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the rift appeared with incredible speed. Almost as soon as the thought crossed Osborne's mind, the rift had already formed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is the benefit of merging the soul of powers into my body? The speed at which I can use my abilities has definitely increased!" Osborne thought to himself as he stepped into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa accepted the kiss without stopping him, only wiping her lips with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Osborne's figure disappeared that she let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Osborne stepped out from the dimensional rift, immediately startled. "Six whole miles this time? That's five times the distance I could cover before my breakthrough! At this rate, I'll be at the Paltrow Estate in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne stepped back into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Paltrow family's main wedding venue, all eyes turned to the entrance. As the host announced her arrival, a breathtaking figure clad in a shimmering white wedding gown slowly entered the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was a picture of serenity. To her left was her father, Dylan, and to her right was her grandfather, Eugen. With them, she gracefully walked down the flower-strewn aisle towards the center, where Alexander was waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!" Gasps and whispers rippled through the crowd the moment Clarissa's face came into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander couldn't help but be captivated, his heart suddenly racing with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Clarissa, a flicker of lust crossing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa walked towards him. Her stunning face remained calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only Dylan, who was escorting her, could feel the subtle tremor in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in and whispered, "Clarissa, I told you long ago that Osborne was never going to show up! How could he dare? The wedding is already underway, and he's still nowhere to be seen. It's time to give up on him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Paltrow Estate. Osborne's walking into a death trap if he shows up here! You honestly think he'd risk his neck for you? Give it up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, not even glancing at Dylan. She responded calmly yet firmly, "He will come. I believe in him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
