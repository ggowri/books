  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was surprised. &ldquo;So it was a VIP experience card. No wonder that loser suddenly became a VIP.&rdquo; She then looked at Osborne with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley remarked with a chill in his voice, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We&rsquo;re going to expose that loser right now.&rdquo; With that, he walked toward Osborne with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley saw that Osborne was busy mingling, he snorted before suddenly speaking loudly, &ldquo;Ha, this is really strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;A worthless commoner who got lucky with a VIP experience card actually thinks he&rsquo;s a VIP? A loser will always be a loser. Even if many people flock to him, he can&rsquo;t hide his lowly nature as a commoner.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s remarks silenced everyone around. The big shots around were all surprised and turned to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone familiar with Wesley quickly asked, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, what do you mean by this? Who are you calling a loser?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m talking about him.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley laughed disdainfully and pointed at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Everyone, you&rsquo;ve all been fooled by this loser. He is not some big shot, nor does he have any powerful background. He&rsquo;s just an orphan and a lowly commoner. The only reason he is here is because he got lucky and received a VIP experience card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This loser is just pretending to be someone important. All those business cards and special offers you gave him were for nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And those who gave hotel room keys, be careful not to lose both your reputation and your dignity.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Wesley spoke disdainfully, everyone&rsquo;s faces shifted, and they looked at Osborne with tight frowns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, having already figured out who Wesley was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew that Ophelia had divorced him because of Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To say he had no resentment towards Wesley would be a lie. He then scrutinized Wesley while comparing himself to the other man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was indeed very handsome and tall. As the heir to a top-tier family, his face was full of arrogance, and his designer clothes highlighted his noble status. Compared to him, Osborne&rsquo;s demeanor did appear much more ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Cat got your tongue, loser?&rdquo; Wesley taunted. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve exposed your identity and your lies, you must hate me, right? Why don&rsquo;t you try to argue back?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. I&rsquo;ve already said before that I&rsquo;m not some big shot. It&rsquo;s just that no one believed me. Since you&rsquo;ve explained it, I feel relieved.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as he finished speaking, the surroundings erupted in an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He actually admitted it. We almost got fooled by him!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No wonder none of us knew him. We thought he was some hidden big shot, but he&rsquo;s just a lucky low-class commoner.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank goodness Mr. Ashford pointed it out, or we would have been embarrassed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I even gave him a half-price VIP card.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;So did I!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No way. We need to get our business cards and VIP cards back. Our business cards and VIP cards are not something a commoner can have.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Get them back!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The faces of the prominent figures darkened, and they all gave Osborne a cold snort. They then ordered their subordinates to retrieve the business cards, VIP cards, and even hotel room keys they had given him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, who had been the center of attention, was now the target of contempt. The business cards, VIP cards, and hotel room keys he had received were soon all taken away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The area around him became empty as those who had surrounded him before now kept their distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley watched with a mocking expression, his handsome face full of disdain and ridicule. Yet, Osborne didn&rsquo;t seem angry at all, which annoyed Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley taunted, &ldquo;Loser, aren&rsquo;t you upset that I ruined your big moment? Do you want to fight me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he suddenly reached out and wrapped his arm around Ophelia&rsquo;s waist. Her body stiffened, but she didn&rsquo;t pull away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne knew Wesley was deliberately provoking him, so he naturally didn&rsquo;t take the bait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="display: none;">He</span><span style="display: none;"> </span>then said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the esteemed heir of the Ashford family, and all you do is run your mouth? If you&rsquo;re game, I&rsquo;m up for a little fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a one-on-one fight to determine the winner and our fates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Got the guts?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne looked at Wesley disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s expression froze at the challenge. As an heir to a prestigious family, he couldn&rsquo;t stoop to a duel with Osborne, let alone one to the death. It was because his life was far more valuable than Osborne&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Wesley couldn&rsquo;t ignore the provocation. So, he sneered and replied, &ldquo;A loser is just a loser, only knowing how to fight. The auction doesn&rsquo;t allow fighting. So, if you have the guts, let&rsquo;s compete with our wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can spend more money at the auction. The loser will have to submit to the winner. Are you up for it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley stared at Osborne with a challenging look. He knew Osborne couldn&rsquo;t possibly agree to the bet. How could a commoner dare to compete with a noble heir in spending money? Wesley just wanted to humiliate Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But to Wesley&rsquo;s surprise, Osborne nodded and calmly said, &ldquo;Alright, I accept.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
