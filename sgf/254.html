Then, he started to prepare and put on a formal dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at himself in the mirror, Osborne was delighted with his outstanding temperament and handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, his primary purpose was not to attend the wedding of Ophelia but to make his relationship with Clarissa public to everyone at the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne guessed that as long as he made his relationship with Clarissa public, he would complete the fourth test given by the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he completed the fourth test, he would once again receive a generous reward from the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must include a method to upgrade Satan's Eye to the fifth level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth level of Satan's Eye could project illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Projecting illusions was the ability of psychic metahumans. Psychic metahumans were rare in number, but each one was extraordinary and had terrifying abilities, such as Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's singing was a kind of psychic power that could control and slaughter people silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Zoe's power, Osborne couldn't deal with the Chevalier family so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once Satan's Eye broke through the fifth level, Osborne would also possess the strange psychic power, projecting illusions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the name suggested, it was to project a spiritual force into the enemy's mind, making them fall into an authentic illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger his mental power, the more real the illusion would be. It could even make the enemy commit suicide in the illusion. </span><span>So</span><span> Osborne could solve the problem without taking any action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Osborne was looking forward to it badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding was going to be held at noon at the Rose Castle. It was still early, so Osborne was not in a hurry to leave and planned to go to Luna Jewelry first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had brought out several uncut diamonds from the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had initially intended to polish and cut them and then give them to Clarissa, Isa, and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had a better choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had absorbed the strange energy in the five blood diamonds, and the bloody red color had faded, turning into the purest top-grade diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was as big as a child's fist, much larger than a pigeon egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It weighed over five hundred carats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such diamonds were absolutely priceless treasures, and you might not be able to buy one of them even if you had money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to design them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to Luna Jewelry first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne drove away. And soon, he arrived at the headquarters of Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a 30-story office building. Luna Jewelry rented the top three floors. Alison's office was on the top floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the elevator to the top floor and saw Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stated his purpose and took out one of the blood diamonds. Alison was stunned, staring at the huge diamond in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wait to get the instruments and take various measurements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's flawless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weighing five hundred and sixty carats! Perfect shape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No cracks! No cracks at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, my god! Mr. Augustine, where did you get such a huge, perfect diamond? If this diamond were put up for auction, it would fetch at least two billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, three billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's even more perfect and dozens of carats larger than the diamond on the Queen's scepter of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>! There are definitely no more than ten diamonds in the world that can compare to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison was utterly stunned, her eyes full of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected this diamond to be so valuable. He thought, "One diamond is worth three billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have five. Wouldn't that be 15 billion dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something seemed wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered, "The Sinclair family unearthed at least hundreds of blood diamonds a hundred years ago. Logically, after they absorbed the strange power of blood diamonds, they would get hundreds of such top-grade diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alison said there are no more than ten diamonds like this in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that it was a little conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that the Sinclair family discarded all the remaining diamonds after absorbing the strange energy of the blood diamonds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would throw away such a priceless diamond, even if the Sinclair family was a top ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what went wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only possibility is that the Sinclair family's blood diamonds were not preserved! Then why can my blood diamonds be preserved? Is it because the way of absorbing the strange energy is different?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sinclair family's blood diamonds were all used to increase the level of power. But I use blood diamonds to improve my physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the Sinclair family's blood diamonds collapsed directly after being absorbed all the energy. But my blood diamonds could be preserved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that it was most likely the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, there would definitely be more than a hundred such diamonds in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, their price wouldn't be so high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, scarcity made things valuable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alison, don't curious about how I got it. I want to design and polish it quickly. I want to give it to a woman as a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison was stunned at his words, and her eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give it to a woman? Mr. Augustine, is it your girlfriend? Who is she? She is so lucky. If anyone is willing to give me a diamond like this, I will do anything for him, even sleep with him every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alison looked at Osborne eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coughed awkwardly. "Do your job first! I'll give you one once I have the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison was overjoyed at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I take your words seriously! If you really give me one, I will be yours from then on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Alison ran away, blushing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
