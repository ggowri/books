  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial in confusion, "Why can't I destroy this Bewitching Lantern? Didn't you say that if it successfully transforms into an Imperial Artifact, we're all doomed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "I did say that. But you can't destroy it. You'd better hear me out first. After I finish, if you still want to destroy it, I won't stop you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmed down and signaled Primordial to continue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial explained, "First, this Bewitching Lantern has already fused with the Phantomagic Realm. It's now protected by the power of the Phantomagic Realm. If you attack it, it's equivalent to attacking the entire Phantomagic Realm. In that case, it will be very difficult for you to destroy it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you have the incredibly sharp Warfare Scythe, it will still be hard to achieve. Moreover, this Bewitching Lantern carries that demonic cultivator's Soulbrand. The moment this Bewitching Lantern is destroyed, that demonic cultivator will immediately notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, that demonic cultivator might execute his plan ahead of time. Even if all his Bewitching Lanterns haven't transformed into an Imperial Artifact yet, their fusion with the Phantomagic Realm means the power they unleash is beyond your imagination.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, everyone in the Phantomagic Realm will die, including you and me. So destroying this Bewitching Lantern now is essentially forcing that demonic cultivator to act ahead of time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and retorted, "If I don't destroy this Bewitching Lantern, once it transforms into an Imperial Artifact, everyone will still die. It's just a matter of dying sooner or later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head and said, "Of course not."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was very confident. "Besides alerting that demonic cultivator, the more important reason I won't let you destroy the Bewitching Lantern is to let these Bewitching Lanterns fully absorb the power of the Phantomagic Realm. Then, when they transform into an Imperial Artifact, it will benefit you more. Don't you want to own an Imperial Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Imperial Artifacts are so powerful. Of course, I want to own one. Also, you said letting these Bewitching Lanterns transform into an Imperial Artifact would benefit me more? Do you mean we can claim the Bewitching Lantern for ourselves?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're really smart," Primordial said with a smile. "An Imperial Artifact is a great treasure. At the edge of the cosmos, Imperial Artifacts are extremely rare because there are almost no precious materials to forge them, nor enough energy for an Imperial Artifact to take shape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Bewitching Lanterns may only be Legendary Sacred Artifacts, but they have the potential to become an Imperial Artifact. Moreover, with the immense energy of the Phantomagic Realm, these Bewitching Lanterns truly have a chance to transform into an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, destroying them now is a complete waste of resources. We just need to leave your Soulbrand on these Bewitching Lanterns and wait for their transformation. When that demonic cultivator initiates his plan, we'll immediately seize control of the Imperial Artifact from him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you take the initiative, you can not only obtain an Imperial Artifact but also ruin that demonic cultivator's plan. Moreover, once he loses the Imperial Artifact, Ms. Alba will easily kill him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was stunned again, thinking, "I can leave my Soulbrand on these Bewitching Lanterns, wait for them to transform into an Imperial Artifact, and then seize control of the Imperial Artifact from that demonic cultivator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "Is that even possible? These Bewitching Lanterns already have that demonic cultivator's Soulbrand. No matter what I do, it will be discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course, you can't do it, but the Warfare Ancient Tree can. Whether it's a divine artifact, Sacred Artifact, or Imperial Artifact, they are all artifacts. Regardless of their level, all artifacts are influenced by the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Warfare Ancient Tree is now at Empyrean Sacredness. So, it can easily control all the Sacred Artifacts. When the Warfare Ancient Tree reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, it will effortlessly control all the Imperial Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, the Warfare Ancient Tree is the nemesis of all artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Bewitching Lanterns have that demonic cultivator's Soulbrand. If anyone else rashly does anything to these Bewitching Lanterns, they will definitely be discovered by that demonic cultivator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, the Warfare Ancient Tree can leave your Soulbrand on these Bewitching Lanterns without alerting that demonic cultivator and loosen the demonic cultivator's Soulbrand. At the critical moment, you can activate your Soulbrand and forcibly erase the demonic cultivator's Soulbrand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, these Bewitching Lanterns will be yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Primordial's words, Osborne's eyes widened in immense surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne only knew before that the Warfare Ancient Tree could suppress others' Sacred Artifacts, forcibly erase their Soulbrand, and suppress the aura of their Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected the Warfare Ancient Tree to be the nemesis of all artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree can quietly leave his Soulbrand on the Bewitching Lantern and loosen the demonic cultivator's Soulbrand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that's really the case, things will be much simpler.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's act quickly. That demonic cultivator could execute the plan at any moment. We must hurry," Osborne said anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "These Bewitching Lanterns have the chance to evolve into an Imperial Artifact. If I succeed, I will obtain an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, in the edge regions of the cosmos, no one will be my match. That way, if I want revenge, it will become much easier, and I&rsquo;ll no longer need to worry about lacking strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "Don't worry. That demonic cultivator won't easily execute the plan. Without sensing any threat, he will surely wait for all the Bewitching Lanterns to absorb the entire power of the Phantomagic Realm, and only act after the Bewitching Lanterns evolve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What you need to do next is find as many Bewitching Lanterns as possible and have the Warfare Ancient Tree leave your Soulbrand on them. The more Bewitching Lanterns you find, the greater the chance of our plan succeeding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, you previously obtained a Bewitching Lantern. Take it out and let it absorb the power of the Phantomagic Realm. Only when all ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns gather together will they have a greater chance of evolving into an Imperial Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was very excited. "Alright, I know what to do. I will find as many Bewitching Lanterns as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are a total of ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, these Bewitching Lanterns must be hidden by that demonic cultivator in various corners of the Phantomagic Realm to devour its entire power. If it were anyone else trying to find the Bewitching Lanterns, it would be absolutely impossible for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with the help of Satan's Eye, Osborne can completely accomplish it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he can't find all the Bewitching Lanterns, having the Warfare Ancient Tree leave its Soulbrand on all of them will surely allow him to find some, increasing the success rate of their plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, the Warfare Ancient Tree began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea what the Warfare Ancient Tree did. Its branches coiled around the Bewitching Lantern a few times but quickly detached and returned to Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Alright. The Warfare Ancient Tree has left your Soulbrand on this Bewitching Lantern. However, your Soulbrand hasn't been activated yet. Now, let's immediately go search for the other Bewitching Lanterns."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, the more Bewitching Lanterns we find, the easier it will be to seize control of the Bewitching Lanterns from that demonic cultivator. So, it's all up to you now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry. Finding things is what I do best."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, an excited glow burst from Osborne's Satan's Eye.</span></p><div class="pagination">
