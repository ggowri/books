  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Faced with Ambrose's relentless attacks, Hannah shifted from defense to offense, launching a counterattack of her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dark energy surged around her like an explosion, resembling a shockwave that shattered all the thunderous sword strikes aimed at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an unexpected turn of events, Hannah was gaining the upper hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was hard to believe, considering Ambrose was a mid-level Deity King, while Hannah only boasted the peak of an early Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even more astonishing was the fact that Ambrose wielded the Supreme Malevolence Sword, while Hannah fought bare-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thunder rumbled as dark energy swept through the battlefield, dismantling the storm of sword strikes and crashing into Ambrose. His divine power defense shattered and flickered like a candle flame caught in a gust of wind. A sizzling sound echoed as the energy corroded his protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Ambrose's defense crumbled, leaving him visibly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, he reacted quickly, summoning the Supreme Malevolence Shield just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shield enveloped him, managing to stave off Hannah's dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when the dark power finally dissipated, the Supreme Malevolence Shield glowed dimly, clearly weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is going on?! How can your dark power be this strong? This shouldn't be happening! You're just an early Deity King; how can you even stand a chance against me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice was strained, tinged with panic and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd of a million spectators was equally astonished, watching Hannah with wide eyes filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't comprehend how Hannah had managed to press Ambrose down so effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for Ambrose's Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, he would have already faced defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made Hannah so formidable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her dark power seemed unnaturally potent, possessing an alarming corrosive effect that even the Supreme Malevolence Shield struggled to counter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is Hannah really from the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Oberon from the Mystic Feather Clan felt an overwhelming wave of regret wash over him. He had saw Hannah showcase her incredible abilities, and even the top talent of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, Ambrose, was being easily suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oberon regretted ever thinking about taking Hannah back to the Mystic Feather Clan headquarters. He regretted trying to force her into the Bowman family's fold for atoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A talent like Hannah deserved the full protection of the Mystic Feather Clan&mdash;no matter the cost, even if it meant straying into conflict with the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even the current first talent of the Mystic Feather Clan wouldn't have a chance against Ambrose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, here was Hannah, achieving what no one else in the clan could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was too late for regrets. Hannah had developed resentment towards him and the Mystic Feather Clan. She wouldn't easily forgive them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose glared at Hannah, fury radiating from his eyes as he roared in outrage, "You can't possibly be my equal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no way you're this strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah couldn't help but smirk at his nearly manic expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting his furious gaze, she replied coolly, "It isn't that I'm strong; it's that you're simply weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, at least three are stronger than me! There are at least two who are on par with my strength! They could wipe the floor with you! Even the weakest of us can defeat you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ambrose, you're just too weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you seriously think you can defeat one of the Seven Young Deity Kings on this stage? You must be dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Hannah finished speaking, Ambrose's face contorted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah wasn't lying; among the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, Osborne, Anastasia, and Mila were all significantly stronger than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe and Kendra were her equals, while Diana and Bryce were slightly weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah believed that even they, equipped with the right divine artifacts, could easily defeat Ambrose in a straightforward battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, Ambrose seemed weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for the various races observing this confrontation, her words struck like a thunderclap, leaving them utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah, visibly dominating the mid-level Deity King Ambrose, claimed that at least three out of the seven could best her and that two more were on her level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could it be possible? That each of the Seven Young Deity Kings could wipe the floor with Ambrose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't wrap their heads around it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose shared their disbelief. His fury erupted anew, and he bellowed, "Hannah, you damn Mystic Feather Clan trash! How dare you associate yourself with the lowly Human Community while praising them? You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he unleashed a furious assault, swinging the Supreme Malevolence Sword with reckless abandon, a torrent of lightning aimed directly at Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately for him, it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah's dark elemental essence had reached mid-Level Eight, boasting formidable corrosive abilities that even Osborne couldn't compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She effortlessly deflected all of Ambrose's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his efforts thwarted instilled a sense of panic in Ambrose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, attack together! Kill her!" he shouted desperately, rallying those around him for a collective strike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
