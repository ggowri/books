  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, Osborne was also very shocked at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only knew that the Royal Treasury held countless Sacred Artifacts, enough to provide every Royal Family member with a Sacred Artifact matching their corresponding strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Royal Family members, the grade and quantity of Sacred Artifacts they could use entirely depended on the maximum grade and quantity they could handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never worried about lacking Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in his previous life, Osborne, though a prince of the Royal Family, was looked down upon and humiliated because of his mother's status.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never been to the Royal Treasury to select a Sacred Artifact, nor had anyone told him how many treasures were hidden within.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he knew nothing about the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, upon learning that the Royal Treasury possessed 1.896 billion Sacred Artifacts, Osborne was equally shocked and found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He once thought he was already very wealthy. He also owned a large number of Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially in the Phantomagic Realm, he obtained the Dimensional Bags of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors at once, gaining thousands of Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, compared to the vast inventory of the Royal Treasury, Osborne realized the gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Treasury was beyond his comparison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Royal Treasury contained over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of concept is this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For most Second-rate Powers, owning one or two Legendary Sacred Artifacts is already rare, let alone Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Supreme Sacred Artifacts can only be owned by First-rate Powers. But the number they possess is certainly not many.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many high-ranking members of First-rate Powers only use Legendary Sacred Artifacts, not Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a force like Fairy Moon Sect to produce dozens or even hundreds of Supreme Sacred Artifacts is truly astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Royal Treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the number of Supreme Sacred Artifacts astonishingly exceeds ten thousand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such scale is truly breathtaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't have much time to dwell on his amazement, as the exchange time in the treasury was limited to only two hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This massive treasury housed 1.89 billion Sacred Artifacts, and even a quick glance would take a significant amount of time, let alone carefully selecting, calculating, and completing the exchange process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours is really tight!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne led Clara and Leroy into the passage first, and the others quickly reacted, following closely behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Walking through the long passage, Osborne noticed that the oil lamps on both sides used for lighting were actually all Sacred Artifacts, and not low-grade or mid-grade, but Superior Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using Superior Sacred Artifacts as lighting tools?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are truly extravagant!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's practically showing off wealth!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head; he had no interest in Superior Sacred Artifacts and was no longer moved by Legendary Sacred Artifacts either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nowadays, to catch his attention, it would have to be at least a Supreme Sacred Artifact, and it must perfectly suit his type.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's main purpose in coming to the Royal Treasury this time was not to exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact to enhance his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His true goal was to retrieve Michelle's relics!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Michelle was executed by Frederick, her relics were confiscated, and part of them should be stored in the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, most of those items are likely Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Some of them were my mother's favorite items when she was alive! I must find and take them. They belong to my mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth, silently recalling the appearance of those items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A necklace, a ring, and a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of three of Michelle's relics, things he must find and take away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finding Michelle's relics and redeeming them, if there are any Kingdom Duel Scorepoints left, he will consider exchanging them for other Sacred Artifacts to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "With a goal, it shouldn't be hard to find!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking, Osborne finally passed through the long corridor and stepped into a vast, boundless treasure vault. When he saw the scene before him, he was once again stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person behind him was also standing there in a daze at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were already surprised when they heard the numbers earlier. However, when they truly faced the countless massive shelves in the treasure vault displaying various Sacred Artifacts, the dazzling scene left them even more stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of scene is it when 1.89 billion Sacred Artifacts are placed together?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a quantity was hard for them to imagine; they only felt it was a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when they saw it with their own eyes, they realized it was even more than they had imagined!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, some Sacred Artifacts are very small, like a ring or a token, while others are enormous, like a mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such 1.89 billion Sacred Artifacts of varying sizes stacked together formed this endless treasure vault, filled with Sacred Artifacts radiating a mysterious glow everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt dizzy, not knowing where to focus their gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were equally stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the mountain of Sacred Artifacts, they didn&rsquo;t know which way to go or how to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's voice awakened them, "Remember, only choose Supreme Sacred Artifacts. For you, Legendary Sacred Artifacts are already sufficient and won't further enhance your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if you possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact, you can go further, and even when facing opponents like Princess Seraphina, you won't suffer due to the gap in Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are only over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts here in total."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't waste time on other items, focus on finding from the Legendary Sacred Artifacts, trust your instincts. Two hours should be enough for you to make a choice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you has 24 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, theoretically enough to exchange for two to three Supreme Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Osborne's words, Clara and Leroy immediately nodded, suddenly feeling much clearer in their thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed in a direction and said, "The Sacred Artifact aura over there is the strongest, it should be the area where the Supreme Sacred Artifacts are stored. Go search there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy quickly nodded. "What about you? For you, only Supreme Sacred Artifacts can enhance your strength, right? Aren't you coming with us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I'll go later, don't worry about me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne wasn't sure about the level of Michelle's relic. Considering her status as a maid at the time, her relic might not be of high level, and it could even just be an Inferior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he needed to thoroughly search the entire Royal Treasury, find Michelle's relic, and then head to the area where the Supreme Sacred Artifacts were located.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "Alright, we'll go first, talk later!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy quickly left, heading toward the direction of the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no one else behind them, as the others' Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were not enough to exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact, at most only a few Ultimate Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was already enough to meet their needs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone quickly came to their senses, excitedly dispersed to search for their preferred Sacred Artifacts to exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, only Osborne and Aiden were left around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden coldly stared at Osborne's back and said calmly, "Aren't you going to choose? You have the most Kingdom Duel Scorepoints and can easily exchange for several Supreme Sacred Artifacts. I can tell you, they're in that direction, so you don't go the wrong way..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
