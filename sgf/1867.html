  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Uncle Zachary, could you tell me about the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face darkened immediately. "You want to learn it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his nose sheepishly. "I heard the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique is pretty impressive, so I was just curious and wanted to learn more about it. Whether I learn it or not doesn't really matter. If it's classified, just pretend I didn't ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Zachary quickly replied, "The Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique is indeed classified, but like I said before, from now on, you're part of the family. So, there are no secrets from you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just worried that once you know about it, you'll want to learn it... To be honest, none of us are willing to use the family's deadly forbidden technique unless there's no other choice. The side effects are far too severe. You've seen Seth's condition yourself. If it weren't for you, he wouldn't have made it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "If the concern is the side effects, Uncle Zachary, you can rest easy. Don't forget, I was able to heal Uncle Seth. The side effects of the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique wouldn't be a problem for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, Zachary froze for a moment. He slapped his forehead and chuckled, "How could I forget that? Everyone else fears the side effects of the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique, but you don't have to worry at all. If there are side effects, you can just fix them. Alright, since that's the case, I'll tell you about it." Osborne's ears perked up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary began, "Osborne, the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique is called the Draconic Formation. It's a martial art with incredible defensive power. By burning divine power in an instant, it creates a Draconic Formation on the battlefield, which can block large-scale enemy attacks and buy time for retreat or escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't describe its full effect, but it's overwhelmingly powerful. Without the Draconic Formation, every time the Hudson family's army faced annihilation, someone had to make the ultimate sacrifice, use the Draconic Formation, and help others retreat. If not for that, the Hudson family's battlefield losses would have been several times worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For some reason, we Hudsons have had terrible luck in recent years. On the battlefield, we always seem to run into the Dark Deity Legion's main force and get surrounded. If it weren't for the Draconic Formation, we would've completely fallen from grace and wouldn't still be one of the ten great families of the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Zachary let out a deep sigh. Seeing this, Osborne frowned, "The Hudson family's had terrible luck? Always running into the Dark Deity Legion's main force and getting surrounded?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that this wasn't just a case of bad luck. His mind immediately went to the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Could it be the Baxter family stirring up trouble? They've already betrayed the Human Community and sided with Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan. Do you think it's possible that the Baxter family secretly leaked the Hudson family's intel to the Dark Deity Legion? Is that why you guys keep getting surrounded by their main forces and suffering such heavy losses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought it was highly likely. After all, the Hudson family was one of the top ten families in the Human Community, a Dukedom level power, and like the Baxter family, a force within Apocalypse City. The rivalry between them made it entirely plausible that the Baxter family wanted to take down the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back, Osborne probed further. "Uncle Zachary, do you really believe this is just the Hudson family having bad luck? What if someone's sabotaging you guys from the shadows, leaking your intel to the Dark Deity Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's body tensed at the question. After a moment of seriousness, he nodded and said, "So, you've thought of it too. To be honest, we've suspected something was off for a while now. We've been investigating quietly, but so far, we haven't found any solid evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Uncle Zachary, do you already have someone in mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary hesitated before nodding again. "We suspect the Baxter family. Unfortunately, we haven't uncovered any proof yet. Don't go around spreading this. Just be careful around the Baxter family in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and mused, "So, the Hudson family suspects the Baxter family, too, but they haven't found any evidence either. Looks like the Baxter family is doing a good job of covering their tracks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed the thought aside and shifted the conversation to the deadly forbidden technique&mdash;Draconic Formation. "Uncle Zachary, can you show me the Draconic Formation just once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary froze for a moment at the request but quickly nodded. "Alright. If you want to see it, I'll show you. But you'd better fix the side effects for me afterward, you hear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned in response. Seeing this, Zachary smiled, "Alright then. Let's head to the training field."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Zachary, Osborne soon arrived at the massive training grounds at the heart of Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been here before, during his first glimpse of the Hudson family's power. Back then, 500 thousand soldiers had been training here, and the sight had left him utterly stunned. Now, those same 500 thousand troops were still hard at work. Without disturbing them, Zachary led Osborne to the edge of the grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch carefully, Osborne," Zachary said, wasting no time as he activated the Draconic Formation. Osborne watched in awe as divine power erupted around Zachary, burning wildly. Then, massive dragon-shaped silhouettes emerged from the flames, surging forward under his control and forming an impenetrable wall in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Draconic Formation," Zachary explained. "Once deployed, it's enough to block attacks from enemies ten times as powerful within the same realm."</span></p><div class="pagination">
