  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Defeat Cuthbert?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne muttered to himself. He hadn't thought about this before. Even when he came here, he hadn't planned on taking action. He just wanted to watch the excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he was on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the rules, every Godson on the Godson Rankings present at the event had to challenge Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each challenger would face him in rank order, one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This meant that if Osborne went to watch and Cuthbert hadn't been defeated by then, he'd have to fight him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert is ranked 36th on the Godson Rankings, the highest among the younger generation! If it were a regular match, there's no way I could beat him, even if I used all my cards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the Honor Quest Ceremony isn't a normal fight. It's a brutal endurance battle! Cuthbert has to face every challenger from the younger generation without rest. By the time it's my turn, he'll probably have fought thirty to forty matches, and his energy will be depleted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe I'll have a chance after all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "What matters most is how worn down Cuthbert gets. If he's not too drained, I definitely won't be able to beat him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head and stopped thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An ancient artifact and five trillion dollars in wealth were rewards no one could ignore, but not everyone had the ability to claim them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's get this Honor Quest Ceremony over with and head back! We're posing as members of the Lambert family. With them having angered the Eityreia Organization, I just can't shake this uneasy feeling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said, walking out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Aleena, Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian were all ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena was going to watch the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Representatives from all the major superpowers would be there as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, Stuart told me what happened yesterday. Thank you again for saving him and for avenging Rhett as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena spoke with unusual politeness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aleena, there's no need for such formality. I said I'm with the Lambert family now and must stand up when others try to shame us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena gave Osborne a complicated look but didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go attend the Honor Quest Ceremony!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The six of them left the courtyard. The Williamson Castle was even livelier than the past few days, and the arena had been reinforced and expanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family had set up seats around the arena for all the major superpowers. Everyone just needed to follow the directions to find their seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and the others arrived early and quickly found the seats reserved for the Lambert family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena glanced around, and her expression suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett, Stuart, and the others noticed something was off with Aleena. Following his gaze, their expressions also changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because right next to them were seats reserved for the Eityreia Organization!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family had seated them right next to the assassins from the Eityreia Organization!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's face turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! The Williamson family knows that the Eityreia Organization has been targeting us, and they deliberately seated us next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With their strength, the Eityreia Organization should be in the front row, not in the back with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's expression grew even more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aleena, what do we do now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart frowned, no longer displaying his previous arrogance. Now, he looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's expression flickered. "Everyone, take your seats. Even though the Eityreia Organization is after us, they shouldn't act recklessly at the Honor Quest Ceremony!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll sit on the far left, closest to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Aleena sat on the far left, positioning himself to separate Rhett and the others from the assassins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow and sat down next to Aleena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, seeing this, quickly took the seat next to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett and the others exchanged glances but remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they sat down, more attendees of the Honor Quest Ceremony started to arrive, but the Eityreia Organization's people were still absent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many from other superpowers noticed the unusual seating arrangement and couldn't help but look at the Lambert family members with mocking pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's face grew even darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Aleena froze, feeling an overwhelming sense of murderous intent surrounding him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't just him. Osborne, Emma, Rhett, and others felt it, too. The terrifying aura made their bodies tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, several sinister shadows suddenly appeared on their left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assassins from the Eityreia Organization had finally arrived!</p><div class="pagination">
