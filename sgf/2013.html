  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't too worried about this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had already copied the&nbsp;life essence&nbsp;of these soldiers from the Hudson family. Even if they all died on the battlefield, he could bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their opponents wouldn't have the same luxury&mdash;if they died, they would stay dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, this fight was a win-win situation for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing Osborne had to worry about was whether the Hudson warriors could achieve victory smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their opponents were prodigies selected from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the top ten Upper Races. The Hudson warriors had abundant Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs to boost their potential, but there was still a gap in talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only advantage was their unmatched teamwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they weren't afraid to die, which meant they could freely unleash the Hudson family's&nbsp;deadly forbidden technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draconic Formation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne saw the Hudson warriors spreading out across the battlefield, he immediately understood their strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as the battle began, half of the Hudson warriors immediately unleashed their&nbsp;deadly forbidden technique&mdash;the&nbsp;Draconic Formation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;had an incredibly strong defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was that it could be cast individually or as a group, exponentially amplifying its defensive power until it became like the&nbsp;Veil of Despair&mdash;utterly indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And right now, that was exactly what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless dragon shadows surged across the battlefield, weaving together to form an impenetrable wall of defense in front of the Hudson warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their opponents' attacks rained down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, those seemingly terrifying attacks barely caused a ripple when they hit the&nbsp;Draconic Formation, unable to breach its defenses at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defense was as solid as a fortress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, defense alone wouldn't win the battle. That's why the remaining five thousand Hudson warriors began their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their comrades providing protection, they didn't need to worry about their own safety. They could focus entirely on unleashing all their power in an all-out attack on their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange scene unfolded on the battlefield: half of the Hudson warriors maintained an unbreakable defense, blocking every attack while steadily advancing, pushing their opponents toward the edge of the platform with their impenetrable shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the other half of the Hudson warriors launched relentless attacks. Although the damage wasn't fatal, it was enough to throw their opponents into complete disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, their opponents were cornered at the edge of the platform, forced to endure the relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperately, the opponents tried to break through the formation, but it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only options were to leave the platform to escape the onslaught or get blasted to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the platform would be considered a forfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more opponents were helplessly slaughtered by the Hudson warriors until some couldn't take it anymore and jumped off the platform, choosing to forfeit to save their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no other choice&mdash;it was an unwinnable battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With five thousand Hudson warriors at the highest Deity Overlord level casting the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;together, not even a group of Deity Kings could break it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was truly no way to break through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a normal battlefield, all they'd need to do was wait until the five thousand Hudson warriors exhausted their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was a tournament!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The platform had limited space. They couldn't break the&nbsp;Draconic Formation, nor could they dodge effectively. All they could do was endure the relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Hudson warriors even began to run out of strength, their opponents couldn't hold on any longer. If they didn't want to die, their only option was to flee the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, this strange battle ended quickly with a clear winner...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome left both sides utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even God of Light hadn't expected the Hudson warriors to use such a strategy, let alone that it would work so effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Defense... can actually lead to victory?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light, of course, was familiar with the Hudson family's&nbsp;deadly forbidden technique&nbsp;and had even studied it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defensive capabilities of the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;were indeed impressive, but they weren't invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, using the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;came with a serious drawback: it drained the user's&nbsp;life essence&nbsp;rapidly, like a floodgate being opened. Without Miracle Elixirs, they would die from exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost was simply too high!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would use the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;unless they were backed into a corner with no other way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for five thousand people to cast the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;at once...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in the audience had ever seen such a sight before. The Hudson family had never cast the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;with so many people. No one could have imagined that stacking its defenses five thousand times would make it this terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the platform's defense, which resembled the&nbsp;Veil of Despair, the crowd was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This level of defense... even a group of Deity Kings at their peak would struggle to break through! It might even hold up against an attack from a Supernal Deity King for a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the price is... all five thousand of them will die! Still, trading five thousand lives for a victory in the tournament seems like..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A good deal?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least for the Human Community, it's worth it! In the previous battles, we sent ten thousand people to represent us, and they all died&mdash;and we still lost! Now, we've only lost five thousand to secure a win. It's absolutely worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to look at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they felt a twinge of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret for doubting the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they'd known the Hudson family had such methods and such resolve to make sacrifices, they would have agreed to let them represent the Human Community in battle two days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, they wouldn't have suffered such crushing defeats in the previous battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt guilty for having doubted Jethro and for blocking the Hudson family from representing the Human Community earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Jethro remained expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he listened to the crowd's exclamations, he couldn't help feeling a little smug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these people knew that the Hudson warriors who had used the&nbsp;Draconic Formation&nbsp;wouldn't actually die in the end, they would probably be even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't reveal the truth to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped his hands respectfully toward God of Light. "God of Light, the Hudson family did not fail you! We've won the third Deity Overlord-level battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, well done! Such tactics even leave me in awe! The sacrifices your Hudson family has made for the Human Community will never be forgotten by me&mdash;or by the Human Community itself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, God of Light looked visibly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three consecutive wins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's border competition had started perfectly, with a triumphant streak of three victories right out of the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the Paramount Supreme Clan must be feeling the pressure, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, God of Light's massive divine power projection suddenly appeared in front of the&nbsp;Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at the&nbsp;Ninefold Heaven's Tower&nbsp;with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One! You lost again! I told you I'd give you a surprise today, that I'd crush you! Do you believe me now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem rather weak and defenseless, don't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
