  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert&nbsp;shattered Osborne's shoulder with a punch, immediately throwing another towards his chest. He was determined to defeat Osborne completely, even killing him wouldn't matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In theory, the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony&nbsp;was only about victory, not life and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But accidents happen in combat, and no one would blame him if he accidentally killed his opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in that moment, Cuthbert sensed something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His punch landed heavily on Osborne's chest. In an instant, Osborne's body seemed to shatter, with blood and flesh flying everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But on closer inspection, none of it was real. It was all an illusion created by manipulating light!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he hit wasn't Osborne's real body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just an illusion, crafted by Osborne's control over light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was so lifelike that Cuthbert hadn't realized it at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh, nice punch. Quite powerful," Osborne's voice suddenly sounded behind Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert spun around to see Osborne standing there, unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression darkened completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You created a fake body with light? And you managed to fool me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert clenched his fists tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled lightly. "Is it that hard? I don't think so. My&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;has more tricks than that! Our battle is only just beginning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Cuthbert felt the light around him start to warp and bend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's figure, originally in front of him, suddenly appeared to his left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waved his hand, sending beams of&nbsp;Dissolving Light&nbsp;scattering randomly in all directions. In an instant, these beams reappeared right in front of Cuthbert, aimed directly at his vital points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had no time to dodge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over a dozen&nbsp;Dissolving Lights&nbsp;struck his chest simultaneously. Despite Cuthbert's formidable defenses, the pain forced him to stagger back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face turned even darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Twisting light? No, this isn't ordinary light manipulation! A regular&nbsp;light elemental metahuman&nbsp;couldn't distort light enough to trick my perception!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled. "Want to know? Too bad, I'm not telling you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne unleashed another barrage of&nbsp;Dissolving Light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These beams seemed to shoot randomly in all directions, and Cuthbert's perception confirmed the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, in the next instant, they abruptly appeared in front of him again, targeting his vital spots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caught off guard, Cuthbert couldn't dodge and had to rely on his body to withstand the attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once again, the force of the attack pushed Cuthbert back. He glanced at the scorched marks on his chest, his face darker than ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's methods were proving troublesome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gritting his teeth, Cuthbert rushed at Osborne, determined to strike his real body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he soon realized he couldn't get near Osborne. The twisted light made it impossible for him to lock onto Osborne's position. What appeared to be a straight path was actually distorted, causing him to move farther away the more he tried to close in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was furious. Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;was far too troublesome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't land a hit on Osborne and couldn't avoid Osborne's attacks, becoming nothing more than a target.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the relatively weak power of the&nbsp;Dissolving Light, he would have already lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This can't go on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I want to defeat him, I must destroy his&nbsp;Light Realm! Looks like I'll have to&nbsp;self-destruct my Strength Realm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even without my&nbsp;Strength Realm, I can still beat him! But if I self-destruct it, reaching an eighty-win streak will be impossible, and even seventy wins might be hard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But at the very least, I have to defeat him. It'll be a disgrace if I can't even reach fifty wins! How will I ever aim for&nbsp;Class S?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to defeat him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Determined, Cuthbert began to channel his&nbsp;Strength Realm, colliding with Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Self-destruct!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert roared as his&nbsp;Strength Realm&nbsp;disintegrated, unleashing a terrifying force that surged toward Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that moment, Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;seemed to be hit by a tidal wave, with light bending and flickering chaotically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crack! Crack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne furrowed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power of Cuthbert's realm explosion was immense. Even though Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;was stable, it couldn't withstand the impact and started to disintegrate rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't attempt to use his&nbsp;psychic strength&nbsp;to stop his realm from collapsing because he knew it would be futile and would only cause more backlash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's&nbsp;Light Realm&nbsp;was on the verge of shattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert, blood seeping from the corners of his mouth, smiled coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Without your&nbsp;Light Realm, you're finished!"</p><div class="pagination">
