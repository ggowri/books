  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, what just happened?" Osborne muttered, his brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why was my mind so clear just now, ideas coming at me from all directions, and now it's back to normal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was puzzling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This has never happened before! Wait, it seems like something similar occurred back on Dragon Scale Island. But that time, I didn't practice cultivation, so I didn't notice it as much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dragon Scale Island...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And today..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if a light bulb went off in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened on Dragon Scale Island that day, and today? There's got to be a connection. Come to think of it... they do have something in common."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's thoughts raced, and then it hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be because of Emma?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A peculiar expression crossed his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Dragon Scale Island, he had attempted to alter Emma's memories, only to be struck by a powerful backlash that severely injured his soul, leaving him immobilized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Emma had forced herself on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And today, they had been intimated once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both times, after the sex with Emma, his mind had become extraordinarily clear. The moment he entered a state of cultivation, ideas and insights flooded in, rapidly solving problems that had previously baffled him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In such a state, his cultivation speed had skyrocketed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Normally, mastering the spatial realm might have taken him an indefinite amount of time. Perhaps he never would have achieved it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, mastering such a power depended not on hard work but on extraordinary comprehension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people might never be able to master such skills due to a lack of comprehension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had managed to master Spatial Realm in just a few hours, as if his comprehension had dramatically expanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be that Emma has some special ability that boosts my comprehension when we're together? That's just too weird."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression grew increasingly awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, whatever it is, I'll just have to call her over and test it again to be sure," he murmured to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given how things had developed between them, Osborne didn't see any reason to shy away. Emma had been the one taking the initiative so many times. Now, it was his turn to take the lead. There was no need to be embarrassed anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After thinking it over, he sent a message to Emma, asking her to come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Emma showed up in her pajamas, her face lighting up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, are you actually missing me? I can't believe you made the first move! I was starting to think you were completely indifferent to me," she teased, her eyes twinkling as she threw herself into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, still not entirely comfortable with her playful boldness, hesitated but quickly explained his theory to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma paused, surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you think I have some special ability? That being with me somehow sharpens your mind? And you want to, what, test this by doing it again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her initial excitement faded into a slight disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, his tone calm. "I won't lie to you, Emma. That's why I asked you to come over. But I also can't deny that I'm drawn to you. If I weren't, I wouldn't have let things go this far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened on Dragon Scale Island was unexpected. But today, I could've stopped it, and I didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's disappointment disappeared at his words, replaced by a playful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see what you mean! Don't worry, I'm not upset. I know you don't love me yet, but I'm patient. I believe that someday, you will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for the sex, I can't wait for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anytime, anywhere, just say the word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a cheeky grin, she let her pajamas slide off, revealing her flawless figure. She looked at Osborne with a teasing glint in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swallowed hard, hesitating for just a moment before he moved closer and wrapped her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's body trembled, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was finally making the first move!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that part of his motivation was to test his theory about her supposed special ability, but that didn't bother her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What mattered to her was that Osborne was taking the initiative, proving that she wasn't just an afterthought to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to hold back her feelings, she gently cupped his face and kissed him, whispering in his ear, "Osborne, I love you. I really, really love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stiffened at her words but didn't respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Emma nudged him gently. "Osborne, why don't you check if your mind is sharper now?"</p><div class="pagination">
