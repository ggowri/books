  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, shall we take a break?" Clara said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, she and Leroy were only responsible for dealing with various native creatures and already felt exhausted. After all, many of these creatures had extremely strong bodies, requiring them to unleash Sacred Power to cut through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, their Sacred Power was significantly depleted, and they were struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what shocked them was that Osborne seemed to know no fatigue, and his Sacred Power appeared endless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, Osborne consumed ten or even a hundred times more Sacred Power than they did, yet he always remained at his peak, showing no signs of exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara held on for a long time, but seeing Osborne still full of energy, she finally couldn't help but suggest taking a break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed they were a bit tired and realized his mistake.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy didn't have the Chaotic Spiritual Root to restore Sacred Power anytime, anywhere. By now, they had completely run out and had to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and agreed, "Alright, you rest here for a bit! There's another group of Abyssal Snakes over there; I'll go kill them and look for their nest in the meantime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In their nest, there must be a large amount of Abyssal Snake Slough! The value of Abyssal Snake Slough is much higher than that of the Abyssal Snake's poison gland."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They shed their skin only once in a lifetime. One Abyssal Snake Slough can be exchanged for fifty thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne got off Flash's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He patted Flash's head and said, "Flash, stay here and protect them. I'll be back soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne ignored Clara and Leroy's reactions and disappeared using interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were both helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only sit down, take out the Sacred Crystal, and quickly restore their Sacred Power. With the Empyrean Sacredness Flash here, they wouldn't be in any danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Flash didn't make a move, Clara and Leroy both knew Flash was very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An hour later, Osborne returned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he revealed a large pile of loot, mostly Abyssal Snakes, along with some Bloody Ivy, </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The corpses were piled up like a small mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "When I went to find the Abyssal Snake's nest, I happened to come across a group of Bloody Ivy and a group of </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths, so I killed them along the way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's deal with the corpses together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, I found an Abyssal Snake's lair and got some Abyssal Snake Slough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out a pile of Abyssal Snake Slough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Abyssal Snake Sloughs can be exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> without any processing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A total of 620 Abyssal Snake Sloughs. According to our distribution plan, each of you gets 140, and the rest are mine..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said this and put away over 300 Abyssal Snake Sloughs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One Abyssal Snake Slough can be exchanged for 30,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. These over 400 Abyssal Snake Sloughs can be exchanged for nearly 20 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a great harvest!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although compared to the 2,000 Beast Soul Flowers and hundreds of Abyssal Clan Empyrean Sacredness skeletons in the Satan Space, this harvest is nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with the large quantity of this harvest, Osborne was quite happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Maybe by the end of the zone duel, I can win the championship without exchanging the Beast Soul Flowers or Empyrean Sacredness skeletons for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beast Soul Flower is, after all, Flash's food!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keeping the Beast Soul Flower can boost Flash's speed! And the Abyssal Clan's Empyrean Sacredness skeletons can be fed to the Warfare Ancient Tree, helping it grow faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of this and felt very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's tally up today's harvest!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been a day since Osborne saved Clara and Leroy. He had spent the entire day hunting local creatures and hadn't had time to tally his gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were also very excited about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they were recovering their Sacred Power, Osborne brought back another pile of spoils, making them both happy and helpless, as they now had to start dealing with the corpses again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Osborne wanted to tally the gains, they were also very interested and eager to know just how much loot they had collected that day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, while handling the corpses of Abyssal Snake, Bloody Ivy, and </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth, they quickly started tallying them up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Abyssal Snake, we killed a total of 8,600 today! We obtained 8,600 Abyssal Snake poison glands. Each poison gland can be exchanged for 1,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bloody Ivy, we killed a total of 1,200 today, and each Bloody Ivy can be exchanged for 5,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth, we killed a total of 4,800. Each </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth's four intact wings can be exchanged for 12,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee, we killed a total of 2,200. Each </span><span>Tigerstripe</span><span> Bee's stinger can be exchanged for 8,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the 620 Abyssal Snake Sloughs you just brought back. Each Abyssal Snake Slough can be exchanged for 50,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> the total is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara quickly calculated and exclaimed, "The loot we gained today, if all exchanged for Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, will be 120,700,000!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"120 million!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara was shocked, not expecting to gain so much on just the first day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them gained loot equivalent to 120 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in just one day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the third day of the zone duel...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still have a full seven days ahead. By the end of the zone duel, their total gains could reach 1 billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were both surprised by this number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she knew their gains for the day would be significant, she hadn't expected it to be this much before doing the actual calculations. This number far exceeded their expectations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's 120 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the distribution plan, Clara and Leroy each get 20%, which is 24 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just one day, each of them gained 24 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne said he would find a way to get them both into the top ten, but they didn't believe it, as this was zone duel, not state duel...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Clara and Leroy thought that no matter how skilled Osborne was, it was impossible for him to get them into the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now they believe it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to their calculations, 24 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> are almost enough to get them into the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, even if they gain nothing more from now on, there's a high chance they'll make it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy were breathing heavily with excitement, looking at Osborne with admiration and gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat dissatisfied with such gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We worked hard all day, and the result is only 120 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>? I only have over 70 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>..." Osborne said helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt it was too little!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had previously spent just over a day to collect more than 3,000 Beast Soul Flowers, which could be exchanged for 3 billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This doesn't even include the hundreds of Empyrean Sacredness skeletons Osborne found, which could also be exchanged for several hundred million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now he only gained just over 70 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in one day. That's too little.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I need to find a way to earn more points! Only then can I ensure winning the championship and save all the Beast Soul Flowers!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
