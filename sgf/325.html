  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne released dozens of combat drones from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between the diamond mine and the Chevalier family made him discover the powerful effects of combat robots and combat drones, so he quickly purchased a batch of the highest-level, Class A combat drones and combat robots from the Draco Group's mall through the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These combat robots and drones were equipped with the Draco Group's most advanced energy weapons, adjustable electromagnetic energy. If they were output at maximum power, even a Class B+ strong man would be injured if hit head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Class A master would have to avoid the onslaught of a large-scale attack by combat robots and drones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the prices of these combat robots and drones were simply too expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Osborne's four-star authority, even if it was the internal price, and it was already 40% off, the price of each combat drone was still as high as 30 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a long time, and finally purchased 100 each, spending a total of six billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, these combat robots and drones were constructed using the strongest A-grade alloy, forged throughout their bodies. Even anti-material sniper rifles or rocket launchers wouldn't easily destroy them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a Class B strongman attacked with all his strength, it was difficult to cause destructive damage to them, and they would not be easily destroyed, which made Osborne feel even more distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne only released over 20 combat drones, which flew towards the pirates three miles away at an extremely fast speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still didn't know whether there were any experts hidden among these pirates, so he would not take the risk himself. It was most appropriate to use these combat drones to block and test them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that the pirates possessed rocket launchers, Osborne was unwilling to let them get too close. Even if he wasn't afraid, the Alisa Ship would be susceptible to damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Repairing the ship at that time would be a huge expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there weren't many passengers on board to begin with, if the Alisa Ship were to sustain damage and a few more passengers were injured, the money they earned from ticket sales would likely not be enough for repairs and compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent predicament of the Augustine family had been caused by these circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rotors of the combat drone were spinning rapidly, making slight noises, but in the dim sky several hundreds of feet above sea level, it would not attract anyone's attention at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they flew over the pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the pirates were only a little over two miles away from the Alisa Ship. If they got any closer, the Alisa Ship would be within range of their rocket launchers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pirates' faces were filled with excitement at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spotted a pirate who had already shouldered a rocket launcher, aiming it towards the direction of the Alisa Ship. He was only waiting for it to enter the attack range to launch immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, no one on the Alisa Ship noticed anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder the Augustine family has suffered heavy losses recently. The pirates are launching attacks from a few miles away, not for the sake of money, but simply to cause destruction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this distance, the Augustine family's escort team hasn't even reacted yet, and the Alisa Ship has already suffered severe damage. After all, not everyone has Satan's Eye like me, capable of seeing several miles ahead even in the darkness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing thinking about it, Osborne was serious and issued the command to attack the pirate ships to the over 20 combat drones positioned above them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the combat drone's weapons began to charge, and the light gathered at the bottom, becoming brighter and brighter. After just a few seconds, the charging was completed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the attack began. The electromagnetic energy cannons of more than 20 combat drones shot out bright light and shot towards the pirate ship below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the calm sea surface, there arose a piercing and horrifying scream as over 100 pirates were instantly struck by electromagnetic energy attacks. Although they appeared unharmed on the outside, their cells within their bodies boiled under the intense electromagnetic energy, suffering severe damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, more than 80% of the pirates fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the remaining 20% of the pirates, 80% emitted cries of pain, their faces filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing such an attack, there were only four people suddenly burst out a burst of light from their bodies and resisted the attack of the electromagnetic energy cannon. One of them waved his hand and rolled up a piece of sea water to cover the top of his head to resist the attack of the combat drone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the pirate ship turned around and fled madly into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As expected, there are skilled individuals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but snorted coldly, "However, such energy fluctuations are at most a Class C+ metahuman, and they are definitely not the main force behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I kill them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment and finally chose to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These four individuals were likely just the leaders of the pirates, acting under someone's instructions to attack the Alisa Ship. The person instructing them was likely the true mastermind behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could capture them, perhaps he could extract information about the mastermind behind the scenes from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was not in a hurry to catch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He allowed the four to flee and only ordered a combat drone to follow them from a distance in the sky, ready to take action after their lair was identified.</span></p><div class="pagination">
