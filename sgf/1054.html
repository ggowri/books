  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smiled as he stood up to shake hands with the two visitors, sealing their agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking forward to working with you," Gerardo added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this alliance, the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization would deploy two hundred Class S warriors, six of whom were among the best of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a formidable force&mdash;real Class S warriors, not the cloned versions Gerardo had produced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization truly were the apex of world powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred genuine Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Gerardo not already cloned two thousand Class S clones, he wouldn't have dared to partner with them, given the vast disparity in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he held nothing but confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crossed his face as he thought, "Once I've solidified control over </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and started mining Divine Bone Crystals in volume, I'll crank out even more cloned Class S Jackals. By then, who in this world will be able to stand against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pleasure working with you," Everett said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Likewise," Sin said, clearly pleased with the arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett eyed Gerardo, a sinister thought churning in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we secure the mining rights to </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> rare metals, we'll amass a trove of Crystals of Life. Our ancestors will return, and the entire world will bend to our will, become our slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, League of Divine Descent, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization forged their alliance against the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett continued, "Gerardo, we'll be taking our leave now&mdash;need to gather our </span><span>forces. We won't be helping with your attacks on other factions in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> due to the Court of the Sun's global agreements. We have no grounds to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll only join forces when you attack the Augustine family. Because Sebastian murdered our league's deputy leader, Rumen. We have a score to settle, and even the Court of the Sun cannot intervene in our vengeance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin chimed in icily, "Osborne took the lives of my wife and daughter, both members of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be hitting the Augustine family, too&mdash;and the Court of the Sun can't stop us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne will pay for this blood debt, no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they were gone, Gerardo let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"40% of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> rare metal mining rights, huh? Ambitious, aren't you? But what's the real purpose here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Bone Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or some treasure even I'm unaware of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't matter. This alliance bolsters my chances of crushing the Augustine family and the Draco Group, reclaiming </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once my power grows, I'll take down League of Divine Descent, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and even the Court of the Sun. Anyone who doesn't bow will cease to exist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell the front line to speed it up! I want every major faction in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> bowing to me within five days, or they'll face extinction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will claim the Augustine Estate in Newport City after that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the cold orders, Gerardo utilized interdimensional travel to return to his Room No.1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five days should be enough to fuse with another divine corpse. At that point, nobody will stand in my way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strode into the vault where divine corpses were stored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization were rallying their elite fighters, heading toward </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent was an enormous superpower, a coalition of thirty-six families who believed themselves to be descendants of gods, each family representing a mighty force in its own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, their strength was truly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a global scale, only three entities could even come close to matching the power of the league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the Court of the Sun, the Prophet Alliance, and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Family had 36 branches. Each gave two or three Class S warriors, then that would make it 100.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the League of Divine Descent, this was hardly a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, they had gathered their 100 Class S warriors, led by Armstrong Thornberry, a top-tier Class S from the Thornberry family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rumen's father and the former patriarch of his clan, Armstrong was stronger than Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Armstrong's command, the 100 Class S warriors of the league made their way into </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, positioning themselves near Newport City as they awaited the arrival of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the 100 Class S assassins from </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization also arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all were waiting for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to arrive, knowing that together they would launch a coordinated attack on the Augustine family and made it extinct.</span></p><div class="pagination">
