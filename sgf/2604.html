  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Seraphina in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could have broken through to Empyrean Sacredness over a hundred years ago, suppressing her cultivation level for so long and storing her power in a special container? Once she breaks through, she'll directly become a mid Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isn't this almost the same as him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, when he took the Perfect Dragon Elixir, he almost couldn't suppress his cultivation level and was ready to break through. He ultimately stored the surging power in the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to avoid breaking through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne estimated that once he breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, he will directly become an advanced Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he just smiled, "Oh? Impressive! Breaking through directly to mid Empyrean Sacredness... But unfortunately, even then, you still won't be a match for me! I suggest you don't bother me; it would be better to let Hendrix come instead..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina immediately looked disdainful upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Haha, did you understand what I said? I'm still no match for you? Let's wait and see! As for Hendrix... hehe, Hendrix is at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and he's about to break through to become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With just you? Hendrix wouldn't even take you seriously! He could crush you with one hand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Oh? Then let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, if you're done, please step aside! Otherwise... I don't mind bullying you again. If you fight back, I wonder if Callista would expel you from the Palace?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's expression changed upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She snorted coldly, "Osborne, just you wait! In Necropolis City, I will personally defeat you and make you kneel before me and beg for mercy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina turned and left directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't take Seraphina's words to heart. He left the Royal Sepulcher and continued heading back to the hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy, however, looked a bit serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, is what Seraphina said true? Once she breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness, can she really reach mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "It should be true! She has no reason to lie to us..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you need to be careful! That Seraphina is indeed very powerful! She fused four types of power even before reaching Empyrean Sacredness, it's simply unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, don't rush to break through your cultivation level these days!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We know! Our Sect elders already told us! Glorious Divine Kingdom had mentioned long ago that within three days after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, we are not allowed to break through our cultivation level. They will take us to a special place where opportunities await us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly stunned. He thought Clara and Leroy didn't know, but it turned out they had already been informed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Osborne and the other two had already returned to the hotel. They didn't go to the Empire Hotel but stayed in the same small hotel as before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take this Legendary Dragon Elixir and use it to quickly improve your strength! The place Glorious Divine Kingdom is taking us to not only has opportunities but also dangers!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The stronger you are, the better your chances of survival, otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're likely to die in there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Clara and Leroy's expressions changed, then they nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, we got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy returned to their rooms and entered seclusion again to absorb the Legendary Dragon Elixir and enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no room for improvement anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he just needs to wait to enter that place accessible only to those below Empyrean Sacredness, then break through to Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly felt his vision blur.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tall, perfect figure had already appeared in his room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sensed a familiar presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up and saw that it was indeed Adriana. During the previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Adriana had also been watching from the high platform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana smiled at Osborne and said calmly, "Osborne, you were quite dazzling today! The entire Glorious Divine Kingdom is talking about you as the number one below Empyrean Sacredness! Feeling proud?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, please don't tease me. What number one below Empyrean Sacredness? Compared to a warrior like you, even the number one below Empyrean Sacredness is just like an ant, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana laughed and said, "I wouldn't dare think that way! With the performance you showed in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, even advanced Empyrean Sacredness experts probably aren't your match! I definitely wouldn't dare see you as an ant..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, something about your performance today seemed off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's expression turned a bit serious. She stared intently at Osborne and said, "Osborne, be honest with me. Do you have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Are you deliberately targeting them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Has Adriana found out?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated for a moment but didn&rsquo;t answer, instead trying to change the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Adriana didn&rsquo;t let it go and continued asking, &ldquo;Before, I invited you to join the Fairy Moon Sect, but you kept refusing again and again... At the time, I thought it was because you were proud, but now that I think about it, was it because you didn&rsquo;t want to implicate the Fairy Moon Sect?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember you asked me back then, if you were to go against a Top-tier Power, could the Fairy Moon Sect protect you? Would the Fairy Moon Sect help me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, I told you, the Fairy Moon Sect couldn&rsquo;t protect you and wouldn&rsquo;t help you! It would only advise you not to do that! Because it&rsquo;s no different from seeking death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression turned extremely serious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But at that time, you told me that in this world, there are some things that must be done! Even if it ends in shattered bones, even if you know you'll die... you still have to do it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, I didn&rsquo;t understand why you asked me that, nor did I think much about it! But now, I think I understand..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! You must take revenge on the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom... But the Fairy Moon Sect isn&rsquo;t strong enough to protect you or help you, and you didn&rsquo;t want to drag the Fairy Moon Sect into it, so you rejected me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm right, aren't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana stared intently at Osborne, as if seeing through Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, he sighed and said, "Adriana, why do you need to ask so clearly? Whether I have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom has nothing to do with you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was interrupted by Adriana waving her hand before he could finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Admitting it is enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I want to invite you to join the Fairy Moon Sect for the fourth time! I'm not inviting you to be my disciple, but to become the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect! Your status will be higher than that of a regular Elder, second only to me and the two Vice Palace Masters of the Fairy Moon Sect..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, are you willing to join the Fairy Moon Sect now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked when he heard this and looked at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, why are you doing this? With my strength, I&rsquo;m not worthy at all! Besides, since you guessed that I have a grudge against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and know I will definitely seek revenge, why still..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly and said, "Because you are worth it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the question you asked me back then, I can now answer you again! If you truly want to oppose the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom... the Fairy Moon Sect might not be able to fully protect you, but we will definitely help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what's your answer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you willing to join the Fairy Moon Sect?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
