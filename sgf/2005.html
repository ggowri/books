  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cannot think of a plan, then I think you are an arrogant fool! No matter how talented you are, you will not achieve much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's words hung in the air, and the sanctum fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could feel that God of Light was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro sensed the tension in the room and looked deeply worried. He wanted to speak up to defend Osborne, but in the end, he held his words back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose to trust Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing God of Light's anger and harsh words towards Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, and others' expressions turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, in particular, spoke up icily. "God of Light, if Osborne says he is confident, then he is! He has never been arrogant. If you do not trust him, we will leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We came to help the Human Community, not to prove anything to anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Anastasia grabbed Osborne's arm, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her heart, God of Light was indeed a respected elder and a protector of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to Osborne, she did not matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I can respect and admire God of Light, but only if she does not criticize Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one I truly admire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe and the others were angry and about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne stopped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled helplessly and said, "What are you guys so impulsive for? God of Light did not say anything excessive! Besides, such suspicion is reasonable; even I would doubt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne patted Anastasia's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait for me, and I will be fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne looked at God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was surprised. She did not expect a colder tone in her conversation with Osborne to provoke such a strong reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially, Anastasia, the way she turned against God of Light showed no sign of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was amazed by Osborne's importance to the team and how much they believed in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated and said, "I apologize for my previous words! But I find it very difficult to believe what you said. You said you can help the Human Community win five matches. How can I believe that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Not five battles! If God of Light is willing to trust me and let me decide the lineup that will fight, and under smooth conditions, we should be able to win six of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If luck is on our side, winning eight matches is not entirely impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she did not immediately doubt but took a deep breath and calmly said, "Tell me your plan! If your plan can convince me, I am willing to trust you! After all, our Human Community... has no way out, and the situation cannot be any worse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "My plan is simple! In the Deity Overlord Level match, let the Hudson family fight! Ten thousand Hudson family members in the highest Deity Overlord Level have a ninety percent chance of winning the match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the Hudson family members fight for the Deity Overlord Level match? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, God of Light looked at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro took a deep breath and said, "God of Light, the Hudson family is willing to fight! I dare not say we can win, but there is... an eighty to ninety percent hope of victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was shocked by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "For the past two days, Jethro has been by my side and witnessed the entire process of the matches. He knows how strong the enemies are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, Jethro said that the Hudson family would send ten thousand members of the highest Deity Overlord Level to fight, with an eight to nine percent chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light wanted to ask, but in the end, she held back and decided to temporarily believe in Jethro and wait to hear Osborne's whole plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she nodded and said, "Great! Let's assume we can win the Deity Overlord Level match! That leaves five more matches, and how do we win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "In the Deity King Level match, the Demon Slayer will fight! Our ten thousand members of the highest Deity King Level will win this match! The probability of winning...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's be strict. The probability of winning is ninety-nine percent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light widened her eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "The Demon Slayer has ten thousand members of the highest Deity King Level? I have no idea! The number of members is enough to rank in the top five among all Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what surprised me is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said it has a one hundred percent chance of winning the match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is it possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was bewildered. She looked at Osborne and could not understand whether he was confident or way too arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "A one hundred percent chance of winning...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does Osborne assume they can still win even if the enemy sends out ten thousand prodigies of the Paramount Supreme Clan in the highest Deity King Level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She decided not to argue and listened to what Osborne would say next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's pretend that we won both of these matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Then it is a showdown between Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings! I think there is no need to say much about this match. Our Seven Young Deity Kings entering the field is enough to change the course of the match! No matter what prodigies the enemies deploy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Osborne was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, despite the surprise in God of Light's eyes, she had no intention of arguing back at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reminded, "Four of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions have already reached Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level. If they also participate in the match, you should be careful! However, they probably will not move in tomorrow's showdown."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "I kind of hope they do make a move! I can once kill all the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne continued, "By the way, Hannah is from the Mystic Feather Clan. I wonder if she can represent the Human Community in the match. If she can fight, then our chances are even greater."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light glanced at Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded and said, "Of course she can! However, among your opponents, there may very well be members of the Mystic Feather Clan...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you not care about that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
