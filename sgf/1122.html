  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you regretting your divorce? I mean, I saw that after she regained her memories as the God of Time, she even asked you if you'd consider remarrying her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just think about it: if you say yes, you'd instantly become the husband of a Deity King! From that point on, every god in existence, no matter how powerful, would have to bow to you! So, are you having second thoughts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa tilted her head, a mischievous glint in her eyes as she studied Osborne's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about? I don't regret anything, and I certainly never thought about being the husband of a Deity King! Once she forced me into that divorce, I knew we were done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way I'm remarrying her&mdash;whether she's Ophelia or the God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's resolve was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, didn't seem convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied calmly, "Really? You could charm her a bit; I wouldn't mind! After all, you've got more than one woman in your life now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adding her to the mix wouldn't be a big deal. And right now, we really need the God of Time's help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit embarrassed, Osborne waved his hand dismissively. "Let's drop it! I've already said it's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the subject. "So, you mentioned that the God of Time once pursued your mentor? Is your mentor, the God of Night, actually a male deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, his expression darkening as he glared at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped closer, wrapping her arms around his neck and looking up at him with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Are you getting jealous? Yes, my mentor, the God of Night, is indeed a male god! And he's the most handsome god in existence! Back in the Age of Gods, there were more deities who admired him than there are people in Rosmandi! I'm one of his fans, too&mdash;are you feeling jealous now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew even gloomier, but he remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Jealous? Maybe a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But considering the God of Night was a Deity King, it felt a bit unreasonable to be jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa planted a soft kiss on his lips and said gently, "Alright, enough with the jealousy. </span><span>You can't be jealous of my mentor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because... when I was born, my mentor had already left. I've never met him in person; I only know him through the memories he left me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's thanks to him that I have my current strength. All my power comes from him! He changed my destiny! Without him, we wouldn't even be having this conversation; I'd be long gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her eyes softened, and she gazed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, you're not allowed to be jealous of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa quickly shifted gears. "Anyway, let's not dwell on that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Time has regained her powers, and time on this planet has returned to normal. The world is changing, and we're about to face some serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused, surprised. "The world is changing? What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured, "Haven't you felt it yet? Come on, let me show you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could respond, he felt a sudden rush of energy, and everything around him blurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he regained his senses, he found himself high above the clouds, floating in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he took in his surroundings, his expression shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the... This star power is incredible!" Osborne exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt an overwhelming surge of star power cascading down from the endless cosmos. The stars above seemed brighter than ever, and the star power pouring down was a hundred times more intense than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with star power, brimming with an immense variety of energies. Osborne felt that just one breath could elevate his very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, stunned, trying to process it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained remarkably calm. "You're feeling it, aren't you? This place, this region of proliferation, the flow of time has been twisted and accelerated&mdash;thousands, even billions of times! But the rate at which star power trickles into this region remains constant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we assume time has sped up by a thousandfold, what used to take a thousand years to gather star power can now be achieved in just a year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a thousand times more star power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, that's how it should be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Age of Gods, everyone could cultivate, and even becoming a deity wasn't a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, becoming a low-level metahuman is extraordinarily difficult&mdash;one in a thousand, or even tens of thousands&mdash;might awaken their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reaching Class S is a monumental challenge, and breaking through to godhood? Nearly impossible! It boils down to the fact that before, star power was too sparse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, star power is restoring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This land will burst with vitality, and countless individuals will awaken their power! What was once an insurmountable barrier will become far more accessible in the </span><span>future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those gods and Dark Deities who haven't truly perished will rise again!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
