  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Donald, just focus on getting better here. Don't worry about anything else! I swear, I'll make them pay for what they did to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Herman ordered his men to guard Donald well, then stormed out, anger boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, over at Laird's mistress' courtyard...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was Donald Saxton? A centurion from the Wild Flame Army? Are you sure there's no mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's face was ice-cold as he listened to his trusted aide's report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General, there's no mistake. That Wild Flame Army centurion badge we found? It belongs to Donald Saxton. We even showed his photo to Madam Lena, and she confirmed it was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's more, we found out that not long ago, Donald was at a tavern nearby with his men. They drank a lot, and he was loudly bragging about wanting to find a woman to 'blow off some steam.' Plenty of people at the tavern heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The timeline matches perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, putting all the clues together, we're certain it was Donald who snuck into the courtyard and assaulted Lady Lena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aide hesitated, an uneasy look crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's expression darkened. He snapped, "If you've got something to say, just say it! You're my most trusted aide. No need to dance around&mdash;just spit it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, General!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aide spoke quickly. "Donald Saxton's background is complicated. His father, Herman Saxton, is a general in the Wild Flame Army&mdash;a peak Deity Overlord and a high-ranking member of the Aether Hawks Clan. He only has one son, and he spoils him rotten. That's why Donald acts so recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you decide to go after Donald, Herman Saxton won't take it sitting down. It'll cause a huge stir, and things could get really messy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird frowned, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you saying? You want me to just let this slide? Pretend it didn't happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aide hesitated again but then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General, if things get blown out of proportion, it could be bad for you. If this escalates, Madam Christine is likely to find out about Lady Lena. You know what Madam Christine's temper is like. If she finds out you've got another woman, she'll be furious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's face turned even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt an overwhelming urge to take revenge&mdash;his beloved Lena had been violated, and he couldn't even openly retaliate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't stand the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then he thought about Christine, his legitimate wife, and her temper. That woman was a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if I can't retaliate openly, that bastard still has to pay a heavy price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get our men together, track that kid down, and cripple him! I don't care how you do it&mdash;just make sure he's taken out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, General!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the aide left, Laird was still seething. He wanted nothing more than to kill Donald with his own hands. As far as he was concerned, Donald's status meant nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just couldn't swallow this insult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine. As long as that brat ends up dead, that'll have to do. I can't let Christine find out about Lena, so I've got no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Herman, you're the next&mdash;your son insulted my woman, and even his death won't be enough. One day, I'll make sure you pay too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird buried his rage deep down. He stayed in the courtyard for a while longer, comforting Lena, before finally stepping out to return to the Borden family estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before he could make it home, a figure blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman Saxton, blazing with fury!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Herman saw Laird, he shouted, "Laird! I've been looking for you! You think you can hurt my son and get away with it?! I'm going to kill you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, divine power surged around Herman, his eyes locked on Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird's face darkened. Had his aide already moved against Donald? And had the idiot gotten caught and spilled everything, bringing Herman here for revenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird clenched his jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bunch of fools&mdash;can't even take out one kid without screwing it up. But that brat deserved it. He dared to touch my woman; his death is justified! And Herman wants revenge? Does he think I'm some pushover?! he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird sneered. "Herman, your son had it coming! I only regret not killing him with my own hands! And if you didn't teach your son any manners, that makes you no better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can scare me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Divine power erupted from Laird as well, as he faced Herman head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Laird's words, Herman was even more convinced that it was Laird who'd brutally beaten his son. His rage was uncontrollable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "Laird, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman lunged at Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Laird wasn't one to back down. "It's you who's going to die! Let's see what you've got, Herman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two of them clashed, divine power surging all around.</span></p><div class="pagination">
