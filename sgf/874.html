  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was taken aback by how forward Clarissa was being.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a sudden surge of desire, his erect dick pressing against her abdomen, making her cheeks flush an even deeper shade of red. The intensity of the moment only escalated as she responded with equal fervor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne quickly shifted, pinning her down and holding her hands firmly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, I want you just as much as you want me right now, but it's not the right time. You haven't reached Class AAA yet, and if I take you now, it could jeopardize your future.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wait until you hit Class AAA, okay?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa bit her lip, feeling a mix of frustration and longing. She had been so bold, yet Osborne was still holding back. But as she felt the hard evidence of his desire pressing against her, her face flushed again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, she knew Osborne wasn't rejecting her out of want; he was doing it for her own good.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That realization stirred a blend of emotions in her&mdash;gratitude and a hint of impatience.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! I promise I'll reach Class AAA as soon as I can! Once I do, I'll give you a baby!" Clarissa declared, determination shining in her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, playfully pinching her nose. "Sounds like a plan!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa beamed at him. As she felt his member still pressing against her, with a shy whisper, Clarissa said, "How about I help you out with my mouth instead?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart raced at her words, but before he could respond, she was already moving.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An hour later, Osborne finally tore himself away from their passionate encounter, stepping through the dimensional rift as darkness enveloped the world outside. Tomorrow marked the beginning of his Honor Quest Ceremony, and he had to be ready.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Returning to the First Estate, he found Yulissa, Kendra, and a few others were already there, including Emma and four people he hadn't expected.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were Aleena, Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surprise flickered across Osborne's face as he took in the scene.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others looked back at him, their faces lighting up with smiles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart clapped a hand on Osborne's shoulder, grinning. "So, should I call you Axell or Osborne? You really had us fooled!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, "Just call me Osborne. The Axell thing was a last resort. I hope you're not mad."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart replied, shaking his head, "Mad? Not a chance! We owe you big time. If it weren't for you, we'd still be nursing our wounds in Tethynia, or worse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you're not one of the Lambert family, you're my brother now! I might not be the strongest, but if you ever need anything, I'm here for you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, appreciating the sentiment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett chimed in with a grin, "Thanks for everything in Tethynia, Osborne! Tomorrow's your Honor Quest Ceremony, and all we can do is cheer you on!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian added, "You were only Class AA in Tethynia, and you still took down Cuthbert. Now that you're Class AAA, I know you'll shine at the ceremony. I believe in you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks, everyone," Osborne replied, exchanging warm greetings with them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Knowing the ceremony was just around the corner, they didn't linger for long and soon made their exit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa and Kendra exchanged glances with Osborne and Emma before leaving hand in hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That left just Emma behind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at Osborne, her expression tinged with worry. A few times, she opened her mouth as if to speak but hesitated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled gently and took her hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, don't stress! I told you I'm not upset with you, and that's all in the past now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, Emma visibly relaxed, but her brow furrowed again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Clarissa... is she really not mad at me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head and said, "Clarissa's situation is a bit unusual. She seems to not care about these things; she just blames me for not telling her sooner."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned to Emma, a serious look on his face. "But there's something I need to tell you. Besides Clarissa, I actually have two other women in my life&mdash;one is named Isa, and the other is Austin. If you want to be with me, you have to accept their existence."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma chuckled at that. "Sounds good to me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed the back of his neck, continuing, "Now, about Austin&mdash;she's just an ordinary girl, and she'll be coming to Newport City soon. You can't bully her!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And as for Isa, just steer clear of her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's eyes widened in surprise. "Avoid her? Is she that formidable? I mean, I'm Class AAA now! Is she really better than me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne paused, contemplating his words. "Tomorrow is my Honor Quest Ceremony. Isa will probably show up, and you'll see for yourself then."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's curiosity piqued.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, she took her leave, and Osborne returned to his room to focus.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dawn broke, it would be the time for his Honor Quest Ceremony, so he needed to get himself into peak condition.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne could ace this ceremony, he'd pass the Seventh Inheritance Trial!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can do this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he knew it, night had passed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony was about to begin.</p><div class="pagination">
