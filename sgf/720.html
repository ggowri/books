  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things just got serious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled as he realized Emma was about to unleash her powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she had three abilities: Freeze Power, Psychic Blast, and the Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latter was her ultimate weapon, one he had witnessed firsthand when she effortlessly defeated Godson, Aria, who was ranked sixth in the Yalynch hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just recently, her Death's Stare had taken down two Class AAA Evolved Humans, and back then, she was only Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Emma had broken through to Class AAA, her power had undoubtedly intensified, making her Death's Stare even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Emma's Death's Stare, Osborne had to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned his martial arts aura, hoping to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he underestimated the sheer force of her Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's right eye transformed into a piercing white, and a beam of light shot out, striking Osborne directly. To his shock, his powerful martial arts aura offered no defense; the white light pierced right through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the light hit him, Osborne felt a crushing force bearing down on his life force, a searing pain that made him grunt involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to channel his energy to fend off the attack, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, he wouldn't just be injured. He might not survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Blood Cross sensed Osborne's peril and surged with power, attempting to help him resist the bizarre force of Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a stalemate; Osborne's strength combined with Blood Cross's energy clashed against Emma's Death's Stare, neither side gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smirked, her confidence radiating. "Osborne, you really are impressive! My Death's Stare can't seem to faze you, and it hasn't even left you seriously hurt! But right now, you're too busy defending against it to do anything else, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm going to take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma appeared right beside him, a playful smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it be easier if you just cooperated? Why make me force you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you happy now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Emma wrapped her arms around his neck and bit down on his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really bit him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the sharp sting as Emma's teeth broke the skin, blood trickling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! I've never done this before. I'm really sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss for words, but all his energy was focused on resisting Death's Stare, leaving him unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, flustered, continued, "What do I do now? I saw on TV that I should, um, stick out my tongue?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, stick out my tongue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit his lip again, but this time, she was gentle. Her tongue darted out, slipping into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body jolted at the unexpected sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed inwardly, realizing he couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a beam of light descended from above, enveloping Osborne. The strange power of Death's Stare was instantly purged from his body, and he regained control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the moment, he grabbed Emma, twisting her hands behind her back and pulling her close to him, effectively restraining her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, stop this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't have to do this! It's going to make things awkward for everyone. You're a girl; you should be a bit more reserved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma froze in shock as Osborne wrapped his arms around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected him to neutralize the Death's Stare so effortlessly. Now, held tightly in his embrace, she found herself completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no sense of relief for her. Hearing Osborne's words made her eyes quickly fill with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit her lip, her voice trembling. "Girl? Reserved?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're rejecting me because I'm being too forward? Fine, I get it. I never imagined that one day, I would be rejected for offering myself. If you were gay, I could understand. But you have several girlfriends. Why not accept me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face, dripping onto her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma said, "Let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll leave, alright? It's just Satan's Eye. I can find someone else to help me unlock it. Just let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her anger boiled over as she struggled furiously against Osborne's hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart ached at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he let Emma go now, she'd likely find someone else to help her unlock Satan's Eye, probably in a very reckless way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinarily, this wouldn't be his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't shake the guilt he'd feel if that happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "We need to talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have any emotional foundation, and I don't know you well enough to do something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes lit up with a spark of hope. "Alright!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
