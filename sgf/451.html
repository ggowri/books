  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa tightly grasped the Fate Staff, feeling as if it were a part of her own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked at Alexander again, all fear was gone. What remained was only the spirit to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had given her the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne killed Orion, he discovered a statue that resembled Clarissa perfectly. To the naked eye, it appeared to be just a level-two ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the statue had unexpectedly boosted Clarissa's extra energy to Class B+ instantly, filling her mind with new information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, amidst the shattered remnants of the statue, Osborne found the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Clarissa recognized the origin of the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the weapon of the Goddess of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After acquiring the staff, Clarissa discovered incredible compatibility with it. It could even transform into an intangible substance and hide within her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fate Staff would only materialize when she needed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as long as she held the Fate Staff, she could feel a terrifying power surging through her, greatly enhancing her abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Clarissa had not intended to use the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that a divine artifact held immense value, and if exposed, it would arouse greed in countless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had no choice but to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't, she definitely wouldn't be able to stand against Alexander. That way, she would only be controlled by him and forced to go through with the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, she wouldn't even be able to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was unacceptable for Clarissa, so she called upon the Fate Staff to fight alongside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared in shock at Clarissa, who raised the Fate Staff high above her head, looking like a goddess. Feeling the surge of power emanating from her, he was both grave and excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes fixated on the Fate Staff, filled with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this a divine artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander asked excitedly. He didn't recognize the Fate Staff, but based on its holy aura, he could tell it was undoubtedly a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any ancient magic weapon couldn't match such a divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa responded expressionlessly, "Whether it is or not, you'll find out if you try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "Very good. Truly wonderful. I didn't expect you to possess a divine artifact. You belong to me, and naturally, it does, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think because you have a divine artifact, you're my rival? You're too naive. You're only Class B+. Even if you are with a divine artifact, I can easily defeat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Alexander struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he held nothing back. He manipulated the terrifying lightning once more, gathering it into a lightning prison, aiming to trap Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Clarissa sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swung the Fate Staff in her hand, and a terrifying power erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break the cage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's lightning prison exploded, the electricity turning everything around them blackened. The loud noise caused the wedding venue to erupt in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between the two took place behind the scenes of the wedding, hidden from everyone's view by a large wall. Although those present felt a fierce surge of energy, they had no idea what was actually happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family's disciples worked to maintain order, preventing anyone from approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the VIP section, Evelynn couldn't help but show a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How pure the power is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn murmured as she glanced toward the backstage, eager to see more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie, however, didn't care and scoffed, "I bet they're fighting. I really didn't expect to witness such a great show. That woman actually refused to marry Alexander in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander must be thoroughly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, she is beautiful. Even compared to the four beauties of Newport City, she is not lacking at all. Even I feel a bit tempted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Evelynn replied, "So you want to compete with Alexander?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie smiled faintly, "I know her. She is the Fatebearer. The fate power within her is something not everyone can bear. At least, I can't, which is why I wouldn't want to seek death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander is ultimately a small-town guy and has no idea how terrifying fate power can be. If he truly marries that woman, he will surely be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn raised an eyebrow. "Do you think my brother can withstand her fate power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Charlie paused and straightened up suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brother is Owen? If so, he might be able to handle her fate power. What, are you trying to help Owen find a wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn smiled but remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the battle between Alexander and Clarissa continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander didn't want to escalate the situation, so he restrained his power. But he quickly realized that he had no way to contend with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Fate Staff in her possession, Clarissa seemed like a completely different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still Class B+, but the explosive power she displayed far exceeded that of a typical Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Alexander feel somewhat troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I cannot subdue you without using my true methods."</span></p><div class="pagination">
