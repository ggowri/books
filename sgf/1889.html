  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so surprising about that? Why wouldn't the Hudson family have a Binding Twin Pearl? We're a Dukedom Level Power, after all! Your grandfather is an Ascension Two peak Supernal Deity King, way stronger than Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Trevor can have a Binding Twin Pearl, then why can't your grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose, feeling a bit embarrassed. "So when is Grandpa coming back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary replied, "He's at the Sanctum of Light right now. Unless something major happens, he should be back in three days. We've already sent him a message, so I'm sure he'll return soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't in a rush to leave; waiting a day or two wouldn't hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Uncle Zachary, do we have a military map? Could I get a copy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary laughed. "Osborne, you're still so polite! I've told you you're part of the Hudson family now. What's ours is yours! Just hand me your terminal wristband, and I'll have someone make a copy for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a surge of happiness, Osborne took off his wristband and handed it to Zachary, who promptly sent someone to get the map copied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Zachary suddenly said, "Hey, since you're the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, shouldn't you introduce us to the others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're really curious about them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that each of you has incredible talent, not much different from the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're currently in seclusion in the Dimensional Microcosm, but I can wake them up. Just give me a moment, Uncle Zachary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary sighed, "With talent like that and the dedication to train hard, it's no wonder you're all so impressive! Meanwhile, we old folks are clearly past our prime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shot a pointed look at Virgil. "You should take a page out of your cousin's book!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil, caught off guard, shrugged and looked resigned, not daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Virgil is pretty impressive in his own right!" Osborne defended him before stepping into Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne woke up Anastasia, Zoe, and the others before pulling out a Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found ten pieces of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three Ultimate Divine Artifacts of the lightning element.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, this is your Hammer of Thor!" he exclaimed, handing over the mighty hammer along with the Thundergod Gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes widened in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you actually got your hands on the Hammer of Thor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Osborne recounted the events that had unfolded, and the group's expressions turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Supernal Deity King is that terrifying? Thank goodness you were wearing the Ultimate Luminous Armor and that the Hudson family arrived in time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed, reflecting on the close call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I definitely underestimated the power of a Supernal Deity King. Their strength is on a completely different level than that of a peak Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I was invincible! But thankfully, we came out on top!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we have one Supreme Sovereign's Armor and eleven Ultimate Luminous Armors. The strongest defense is still the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, which Zoe will wear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began distributing the spoils. "Everyone else gets an Ultimate Luminous Armor! If we run into a fight, this will keep us safer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he handed out the armor, four pieces remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to give one to Sebastian, one to Divine Shadow, and one to God of Star, leaving one extra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose to give that one to Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan was also a talented member of the Hudson family's younger generation. While he didn't possess Virgil's level of talent, he was the first Hudson family member Osborne had met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given all the support the Hudson family had given him, it was time to give back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne pulled out the remaining two lightning-element Ultimate Divine Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a bow, and the other was an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were distinct items, with the arrow crackling with fierce lightning energy that made it feel razor-sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the bow looked like it belonged with the arrow, yet it was devoid of any electric power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow bore an ancient character, while the bow had a completely different character engraved on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Aetherial Bow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nova Arrow? They seem extraordinary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Anastasia. "How about you take these, too? They're Ultimate Divine Artifacts, after all. We can't let them go to waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia shook her head, gripping the hefty Hammer of Thor tightly, her excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I don't need them! The Hammer of Thor is more than enough for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Osborne, she added, "You have Thunder Power, too! And honestly, yours isn't much weaker than mine! You should use the Aetherial Bow and Nova Arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After considering her words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only he and Anastasia had Thunder Power. Since she didn't want the bow and arrow, he'd take them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, they would be easier to handle than the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll keep them!" he said, stowing the Aetherial Bow and Nova Arrow away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's go meet my family!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
