  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Shadow Terror Fiend seemed to show signs of fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sparked a surge of confidence among the Paramount Supreme Clan warriors, who redoubled their efforts, focusing all their attention on the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know, thousands of miles away, someone was lurking in the shadows, biding his time for the perfect opportunity to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne spotted his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Three Supernal Deity King with life power, Osric Eldridge, had previously been flanked by two other Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings for protection. However, when Icy Nine suddenly found himself in peril, the other three Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings had to rush to his aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that critical moment, Osric was left vulnerable, isolated from the rest of the Paramount Supreme Clan warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it comes!" Osborne's eyes lit up as he seized the moment without a second thought. He activated his interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he appeared behind Osric, who was busy healing Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught up in the chaos of the battlefield, Osric sensed a ripple of energy behind him but dismissed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a tumultuous environment, energy fluctuations were a dime a dozen. He didn't have the time to figure out whether the disturbance was caused by spatial power, especially since he didn't have any teammates who could wield spatial power in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric assumed it was just one of his teammates stepping in to cover him, and he continued his healing efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that moment of complacency sealed his fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed the attack he had meticulously planned countless times in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Spark Oblivion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gale of Netherworld!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an explosive instant, Osborne unleashed three Divine Ascendance Techniques. Two of them were his own, while the third was a Divine Mark inherited from his grandfather, Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hesitated to use Jethro's mark earlier, fearing it might draw unwanted attention to his grandfather and the Hudson family, but now he had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, was on the brink of Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by using Jethro's Divine Mark&mdash;Gale of Netherworld&mdash;could he hope to severely injure an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled as Osborne's fearsome attack erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric had no inkling of the impending danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was focused on healing Icy Nine, he was caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Spatial Oblivion Slash struck first, but it met an unexpected barrier. Osric was clad in Supreme Sovereign's Armor, which absorbed much of the blow. Though Osborne's attack managed to breach the armor's defenses, it barely grazed his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Gale of Netherworld followed right behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Supreme Sovereign's Armor compromised, the full force of the Gale struck Osric head-on. Even an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King couldn't withstand that onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream echoed through the chaos as his body was left mangled and broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osric reeled from the impact, Osborne's soul power surged into his Soul Current Ocean, igniting his soul power like a match to kindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames of the soul enveloped his head, plunging him into a state of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was still not the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Osborne shouted, driving a powerful kick into Osric's back with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unleashed a kick that embodied the essence of Single Dragon Might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ages since he fought using pure physical strength, and this kick was exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled every ounce of his energy into it, combining his martial arts techniques for an attack that was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was brutal. Osborne's foot tore through Osric, creating a massive gaping wound in his chest. In fact, half of Osborne's foot had penetrated his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne pulled back, he realized his foot was stuck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously?" Osborne thought, rolling his eyes. It wasn't a major setback, though. He summoned more power and yanked his foot free, causing Osric to suffer even more damage. A piercing scream erupted from him, echoing across the battlefield like a wounded beast in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that fleeting moment, Osric had sustained catastrophic injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soul power within him continued to burn fiercely, and the Gale of Netherworld wreaked havoc. As an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, Osric's vitality was astonishingly robust due to his life power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still clinging to life, but he could no longer provide healing to his comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth against the pain, Osric quickly tried to replenish his own life force, hoping to recover. To his relief, his efforts were somewhat effective. With Osborne's current strength, he couldn't finish Osric off instantly, and Osric's wounds began to mend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the flames of his soul continued to rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After merging with the Primordial, Osborne's soul power had been purified and strengthened, making the Soul Spark Oblivion even more potent. In a matter of moments, nearly half of Osric's soul power had been consumed by the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, he couldn't withstand such a toll on his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he stabilized his injuries, he swiftly severed the ignited portions of his soul, discarding the burning fragments. At last, the soul fire was extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this left Osric feeling incredibly weakened. Having cut away nearly half of his soul was no small feat. The fact that he hadn't collapsed or lost his sanity was a miracle in itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now lying on the ground, he glared at Osborne, who was making his escape, filled with unbridled hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had unfolded in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After successfully executing his surprise attack, Osborne wasted no time in retreating. He understood that continuing the assault would likely not guarantee Osric's demise. It would only alert the others, making it impossible for him to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts proved correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne turned to flee, several figures in the distance, including Icy Nine, erupted in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For their team, Icy Nine was their top priority, but Osric was nearly as crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without him, Icy Nine and the others would have been utterly overwhelmed by the Shadow Terror Fiend's relentless assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osric had been ambushed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the looks of it, he had likely lost the ability to fight and wouldn't recover anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat! Get him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they were consumed by rage, launching themselves at Osborne in a frenzy, desperate to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was too quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before their attacks could even reach him, a ripple of spatial energy enveloped Osborne, and he vanished from the battlefield, slipping away from their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All their attacks landed in empty air, the explosive sounds echoing like their roars of frustration.</span></p><div class="pagination">
