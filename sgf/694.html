  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a worried look, Clarissa quickly told the whole thing. "I just called Aunt Donna, but she didn't answer the phone. Then I called Barlyn, but he didn't answer either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I called my father, grandfather, and all the other family members I know, but none of them answered the phone. I'm afraid they are in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked solemn, patted Clarissa on the back, and said, "Clarissa, don't worry. They will be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he said so, he still had a bad intuition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Radcliffe family was a powerful ancient family, and Clarissa's grandfather was an A-level master. Most people wouldn't easily pick a fight with the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, there were two forces in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> able to take down the Radcliffe family without being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and the other was Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen and Osborne were competitors and even had a grudge against each other, but Osborne believed that Owen wouldn't do anything to the Radcliffe family, so the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were the only suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sent someone to warn the Radcliffe family and tell them to leave </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> immediately, but they didn't take my advice. Now they got into trouble." Osborne felt a little guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should have been tougher. Given his current strength, he could have forced the Radcliffe family to leave, but he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he killed Alexander and asked the Radcliffe family to marry Clarissa to him as they promised, but they refused, he had felt dissatisfied with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had some issues with the Radcliffe family, but he didn't want them to get into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were Clarissa's family, and Clarissa fell out with them because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Clarissa helped him kill the members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Osborne should have expected that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might retaliate against the Radcliffe family or threaten him with the Radcliffe family's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Clarissa, don't worry. Let's go and check out the situation now! If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> captured them, they would not kill them easily. Their target is us, and they will probably threaten us with your family's safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded, but her pale face still darkened. She panicked, at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped talking. After quickly explaining to Caleb, he took Clarissa's hand, tore open the dimensional rift, and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne and Clarissa arrived at the Radcliffe Estate in </span><span>Cloudsea</span><span> City, </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, two hours had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It consumed a lot of mental strength to unleash the spatial power, so Osborne took several breaks along the way. Otherwise, given the speed of interdimensional travel, they would have been able to arrive in a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the two hours, Clarissa kept trying to contact her family but failed. She looked more and more worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the Radcliffe Estate, Osborne immediately smelled the pungent odor of blood in the air, his expression suddenly changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw that the Radcliffe Estate was in ruins and the roof had collapsed. Corpses, on which there were sharp claw marks, and blood were everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pack of werewolves did this!" Osborne clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Clarissa saw the bodies of her family, her face became extremely pale. She felt weakened and was on the verge of collapsing, but thanks to Osborne's support, she didn't fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Aunt! Dad! Grandpa! Barlyn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible!" Clarissa was distraught, pushing Osborne aside, rushing into the ruins, and looking for the bodies of her familiar relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye at this time, scanning each corpse. Not long after, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not find the corpses of the people he was familiar with, including Donna, Barlyn, Clarissa's father Dylan, and Clarissa's grandfather Eugen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their corpses were not here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Clarissa also noticed this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there suddenly came a strange voice from a cell phone covered with blood in the ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It said, "The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family and Osborne, the people you are looking for are in our hands! Get to Dragon Scale Island in three hours. Otherwise, I will kill all four of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, I'll wait for you!" After saying this, it fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's and Clarissa's expressions changed at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! They told us to hurry to Dragon Scale Island to rescue your family in three hours. Otherwise, they will kill your family?!" Osborne frowned, not knowing where Dragon Scale Island was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly checked and found that Dragon Scale Island was a small island several hundred miles away from here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I must save them!" Clarissa bit her lip and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry, I will help you rescue them! After all, they got into trouble because of me. However, since the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> captured them and threatened us to go to the island, they will definitely arrange for many masters to ambush us. It will be very dangerous for us to go there alone."</span></p><div class="pagination">
