  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne distanced himself, he halted and activated Satan's Eye to survey the situation behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk edged onto his lips when he saw Riley, Emmett, and the others approaching the </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> ambush zone without a hint of caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and Emmett were deep in conversation, oblivious to the danger lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of their team, scattered along the path, kept their guards up with divine power shielding them. But with Osborne and Diana scouting ahead, their vigilance had waned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they reached the ambush spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to admit that the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had picked an exceptionally clever hiding place&mdash;just around a corner, perfectly disguised as a rock. Within the already dim and foreboding mine, it was nearly impossible to spot, even for the most attentive eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredibly, none of the group noticed the lurking </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. Not even Riley caught a glimpse of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature remained still, aware of its surroundings, clearly intelligent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been a standard </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, it would have lunged at the first unsuspecting soul to pass by, but this one held its ground, keeping its eyes on its main targets&mdash;Riley and Emmett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, just as Emmett passed within arm's reach, the trap was sprung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> unleashed its power in an explosive outburst, capturing Emmett in a terrifying attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proximity was too close; even with the guards surrounding them, no one had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing scream shattered the cave's silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett went hurtling through the air, blood spraying from his mouth as he sustained severe injuries. Just as he seemed on the brink of being finished off, the Malevolence Amulet around his neck detonated, absorbing the deadly blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> chose not to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley had finally come to his senses and was unleashing his divine power in retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect Mr. Emmett Huntington!" Riley bellowed, anger igniting his every move as he charged toward the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was as if the ambusher had been anticipating this. In a blink, it dodged Riley's strike and lunged toward another guard nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That guard was a peak Celestial Deity, but against a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, he was little more than a token defender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single strike, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> crushed the amulet protecting him, driving its claws deep into the guard's chest and tearing his heart straight out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A horrifying scream echoed as despair flickered in the guard's eyes, life draining away as he crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally realizing what had transpired, Riley rushed forward, fury etched across his face at the sight of his fallen comrade. His divine power erupted in a torrent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to unleash hell on the creature that had dared to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Riley's furious strike sent the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> crashing against the wall, leaving it severely injured. But just as he prepared to finish it off, the creature's flesh </span><span>transformed into a spectral form, melding seamlessly into the rock and vanishing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley's attack struck the stone instead, leaving only a shallow mark behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had unfolded in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> sudden ambush that injured Emmett to its evasion of Riley's counterattack and the brutal slaying of a peak Celestial Deity guard, the entire sequence took barely two breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was over almost as quickly as it began. The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had escaped, leaving behind a corpse and a gravely wounded Emmett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley glared at the spot where the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had disappeared, rage boiling within him, but he felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! What just happened? Wasn't someone scouting ahead? Why did a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> still manage to ambush us? And why didn't it attack Osborne and Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frustration was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This elite guard team was his and Emmett's brainchild; each member was handpicked for their trustworthiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing any one of them felt like a personal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how furious he was, the outcome couldn't be changed. All he could do was urge everyone to stay alert and quickly make his way to Emmett's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Emmett Huntington, are you okay?" Riley asked, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett coughed violently, spewing blood as his complexion turned ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... I'm fine! At least I'm not dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to say, then reached into his Dimensional Bag, pulling out a small vial. With a pained expression, he poured out a single pill and swallowed it quickly. Almost immediately, color returned to his cheeks, and his injuries healed significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett muttered under his breath, "Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe I wasted a Nurture Pill! That was made from the Miracle Elixir at Divine Peak Nine! Each one is worth over 100 million Essence Crystals and is incredibly rare. I only got three, and they were meant for emergencies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a huge loss this is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gloomy expression, Emmett rose to his feet, determination flickering in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
