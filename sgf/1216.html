  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, our ancestors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chant rose like a tidal wave among the thousands of Deschanel family members, </span><span>their voices filled with fervor. As they shouted, the violently shaking stone coffin suddenly stilled, and with a grinding sound of stone against stone, the lid began to slide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air, and an immense wave of energy surged through the hall, pressing down on the gathered crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were flushed with excitement, yet their bodies remained pinned to the ground by the overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a tall figure emerged from the coffin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a man, his presence commanding and electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stretching his limbs, he turned his gaze toward the throng of Deschanel family members, a smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared, his voice resonating through the hall, "Finally, I'm free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've slumbered in the Sanctuary Casket for a millennium, while the world outside has changed for eons. What a long, long time it has been! But at last, I, Joseph Deschanel, have awakened, restored to my power as the world reclaims its balance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Descendants of the Deschanel family, we welcome you, ancestor Mr. Joseph Deschanel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Descendants of the Deschanel family, we welcome you, ancestor Mr. Joseph Deschanel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement among the family members was palpable. Under the leadership of Damian Deschanel, they performed three deep bows in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's smile widened. "Who is the head of the family? Look up and speak to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian quickly raised his head, his voice respectful. "I am Damian, a humble descendant. Before you, I dare not call myself the head of the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph regarded him with a calm demeanor. "Three years ago, Terrence Deschanel, the Deity Overlord of the Deschanel Clan, sensed the awakening of life within the Sanctuary Casket. He took it upon himself to force it open, preparing for our return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be the descendants he left behind, right? Three years in the Sanctuary Casket, while three thousand years have passed outside! Thanks to your tireless efforts in providing energy day and night, I was able to awaken before the other deities of our clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have done a great service to the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's heart swelled with pride at Joseph's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, Mr. Joseph Deschanel! The Deschanel family today is comprised of the descendants Mr. Terrence Deschanel left behind three thousand years ago. We have diligently guarded this ancestral land, never daring to slack off, fulfilling his legacy. We are honored to welcome you back today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph nodded, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! But for now, let's call forth more of our clan's deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, an overwhelming power erupted from Joseph, sending shockwaves through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy crashed against the stone coffins, causing a series of intense vibrations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, about a third of the hundred coffins began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumbling sounds echoed as the lids scraped open, unleashing a torrent of power that </span><span>surged through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Figures began to rise from the stone coffins&mdash;men and women of all ages, each strikingly beautiful, their features bearing a striking resemblance to one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most astonishingly, every single one of them radiated an aura of terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gods! They were all gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, thirty-six gods emerged from the stone coffins, Joseph among them. The sight sent a wave of exhilaration through the gathered Deschanel family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't contain their excitement, bowing deeply and shouting in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Welcome back, revered ancestors! Welcome back, revered ancestors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a parallel dimension, Osborne watched the scene unfold with wide eyes, completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-six gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty-six ancestors of the Deschanel family have actually climbed out of their coffins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!" he gasped, feeling a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I get it. Hearin City is under siege by the Beast Tide, and yet the Deschanel family remains unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They have something far more important to attend to&mdash;welcoming their ancestors back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are a hundred stone coffins here, and each one contains an ancestor of the Deschanel family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These coffins are called the Sanctuary Casket?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've been in the Sanctuary Casket for a millennium while millions of years have passed outside? So these ancestors of the Deschanel family have been hiding since the Age of Gods, surviving all this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph mentioned that the clan leader, Terrence, was a Deity Overlord-level warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three thousand years ago, he sensed life returning to the Blue Planet and forcibly opened the Sanctuary Casket to step out, leaving behind descendants who became today's Deschanel family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family's legacy spans three thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all adds up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So this is why the Deschanel family has kept such a low profile. They're clearly powerful, yet they've chosen to remain within Hearin City, never expanding their influence or allowing any superpowers to infiltrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's all for these hundred Sanctuary Caskets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave as he focused intently on the thirty-six Deschanel family gods emerging from the Sanctuary Casket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power was palpable, radiating an aura that was nothing short of terrifying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
