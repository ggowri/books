  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded decisively. "You're right; let's get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Known for her easygoing nature, she didn't dwell too long on her gratitude for Osborne's help, silently vowing to repay him when the opportunity arose. Gathering the group, she led them deeper into the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne noticed that Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, as well as Beverly and Cyrus, seemed unusually downcast, their faces shadowed by hesitation and inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several times, they opened their mouths to speak, but the words never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a hunch about what was on their minds but chose not to bring it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a while, the group pressed onward without encountering any more dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they navigated through the twisted branches of the chasm, and the landscape before them suddenly opened up into a vast clearing, roughly a mile wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center lay a massive pit, as if a giant had struck the ground with a colossal rock. The energy signature of Element Gold Crystals pulsed from this very hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the surroundings. No Phantom Worms were present, and he felt no threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened. At that moment, he finally spotted it&mdash;the Element Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just one, but many!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of the pit, a shattered, multicolored stone lay, surrounded by a jumbled mess of broken rock fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scattered among them were the vibrant Element Gold Crystals, radiating a rich energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of twenty-one Element Gold Crystals lay nestled in the pit, looking almost like any other stone at first glance, save for the intense energy they emitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt his breath catch in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others mirrored his shock, their eyes wide in amazement at the sight of the crystals scattered in the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Alfreda who snapped back first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exclaimed, "Holy crap, we're rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at all these Element Gold Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gleeful cry, she dashed into the pit. "This one's Metal Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's Plant Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earth Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Water Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Gold Crystal! And there's more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time she bent down to scoop up another crystal, her excitement bubbled over, and her cheeks flushed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, along with Beverly and Cyrus, couldn't help but watch her with rapt attention, entranced by the brilliant elements in her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alfreda gathered every last Element Gold Crystal from the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the princess of the Nature Elf Royal Family and daughter of the King of Nature Elf, she had never seen so many Element Gold Crystals in one place before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the seven of them huddled together, staring at the clustered crystals, breaths coming fast with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do we divvy these up?" Avery asked, biting her lip, her gaze flicking nervously to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda paused at this question and replied, "Of course we split them evenly! We agreed that any loot we found as a team would be shared equally! There are seven of us and twenty-one Element Gold Crystals. It works out perfectly&mdash;each of us gets three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Avery visibly relaxed, relief flooding her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gratitude toward Alfreda shone in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubting Alfreda's strength; she was the most powerful among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, as the leader of their exploration team and a member of the Nature Elf royalty, if Alfreda insisted on taking the lion's share of the Element Gold Crystals, there was little the others could do about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery had been worried that, faced with such a bounty, Alfreda might overturn their earlier agreement and propose a new distribution plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she felt a wave of relief wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering for a moment, Avery spoke up, "There are twenty-one Element Gold Crystals here, each representing different elemental powers. They might not even match our primary elemental affinities. But once we leave Umbra Earth, we can trade for the ones we need, even if it's a bit of a hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, as our leader, why don't you pick three first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery's suggestion was met with nods of agreement from Godfrey and Hermione.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly and Cyrus had no objections either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt fortunate just to have a share of the twenty-one crystals, so letting Alfreda choose first seemed only fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alfreda shook her head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! While I might be the captain, the real hero here is Osborne. If it weren't for him, we'd have been in serious trouble back in the mushroom forest. He was the one who spotted the Phantom Worms before they ambushed us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I think Osborne should be the one to pick first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned her earnest gaze toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others exchanged glances, and one by one, they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you should go first!" they urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, appreciating their support. He didn't hesitate to step forward; after all, he had played a crucial role in their journey, and he needed the right Element Gold Crystals to enhance his powers as quickly as possible. Time was of the essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the attributes of the Element Gold Crystal were not suitable, he would have to leave Umbra Earth and find someone to exchange it, which he didn't have the time for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne declared, "Alright, I won't hold back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take this Spatial Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this Lightning Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and this Dark Gold Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he picked the last one, he shot a brief, apologetic glance at Beverly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the twenty-one crystals, there was only one Dark Gold Crystal, and since Beverly specialized in dark power, her chances of selecting one that suited her were now slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Beverly merely smiled back at him, unfazed by the choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up was Alfreda, who quickly made her selections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all twenty-one Element Gold Crystals were distributed, with each person receiving three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy radiated from their faces as they held their newfound treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The value of these crystals was immense, and the power boost they would provide was sure to elevate their abilities significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This expedition to Umbra Earth had already proven to be a tremendous success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they left right now, they had more than most would ever hope to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda asked, curiosity lighting up her eyes, "What's our next move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This branch of the chasm has reached its end; we've explored it thoroughly. Should we take some time here to absorb the power of the Element Gold Crystals and enhance our abilities, or should we head back and pick another branch in hopes of uncovering more treasures?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she looked to Avery and the others for their thoughts, their expressions suddenly shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged quick, anxious glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Avery spoke, her tone apologetic, "Ms. Rivera, we've decided we want to leave Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda exclaimed, her surprise palpable. "Wait, what?! You all want to leave Umbra Earth? Why?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
