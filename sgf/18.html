  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The security personnel heard this and immediately nodded politely to Osborne. &ldquo;Honored guest, we wouldn&rsquo;t dare. Your identity is unquestionable.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once they finished speaking, both Justin and Penelope were dumbfounded, wondering, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What kind of trick did that good-for-nothing Osborne use to not even question his identity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Were they still asleep and dreaming?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wasn&rsquo;t Osborne just an orphan, a commoner? The highlight of his life was marrying Ophelia and living with the Caldwell family for those three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even the Caldwell family heirs had to line up to get in. Why did Osborne get to use the VIP lane?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was indignant and determined to expose him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He even suspected that Osborne must have bribed the security personnel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Where is your supervisor? I want to file a complaint!&rdquo; Justin shouted. &ldquo;You must have taken his bribe. I want to report him. Bring your supervisor here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, a tall, middle-aged woman walked over. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this commotion at the VIP lane? Do you realize you could disturb the guests?&rdquo; she demanded sharply, exuding an overwhelming presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin was delighted when he saw her and said, &ldquo;Ms. Lewis, you&rsquo;re here just in time. I&rsquo;m Justin from the Caldwell family. I want to report this imposter. He&rsquo;s just a worthless nobody pretending to be a VIP to sneak into the event.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other Caldwell family members also chimed in mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Lewis, the manager of Draco Auction House, is here. Osborne is done for. He can buy off the security, but not Ms. Lewis.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne is really in for it now, pretending to be a VIP.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll get his legs broken?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family members eagerly anticipated Osborne&rsquo;s true identity being exposed and him getting a severe lesson. Even Ms. Lewis couldn&rsquo;t help but frown as she looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, she noticed the Draco Star Wristlet on Osborne&rsquo;s wrist. Her eyes widened in shock, and she hurried over to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She respectfully nodded at Osborne and said, &ldquo;Honored guest, why didn&rsquo;t you let us know you were coming? We could have made arrangements in advance. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by these irrelevant people.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she finished speaking, the surrounding area suddenly fell into complete silence, so silent that one could even hear a pin drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t only the Caldwell family members. People from other prominent families were also staring at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who was this Ms. Lewis? Her name was Debbe Lewis, and she was the manager of Draco Auction House. Even within the Draco Group, she was considered a mid-level executive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Mayby City, even the heads of noble families had to show her respect. There might be a few people she personally attended to, but none who received such a respectful greeting. Not even the city&rsquo;s executive officer or heirs of prominent families could command such respect from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet now, Debbe was actually nodding politely to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone in the crowd asked, &ldquo;Who is he exactly?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Could there really be someone this significant in Mayby City?&rdquo; another questioned in astonishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was utterly shocked, their eyes fixed intently on Osborne. They were already determined to form a connection with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family was left feeling awkward, glancing at each other in bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They wondered, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Osborne just an ordinary man? Isn&rsquo;t he a useless nobody? Why on earth is this happening?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Ophelia, who had been silent all this time, now looked utterly baffled and at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew Osborne better than anyone else. He was an orphan with no background. His only relative was a terminally ill sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia then inwardly questioned what right Osborne had to make Debbe nod politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even as the Caldwell family&rsquo;s successor, it was hard for her to get a word with Debbe, let alone make her nod politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Something is definitely wrong here.&rdquo; Ophelia refused to believe that Osborne had a secret, powerful background. She was sure he was pretending to be someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia stepped forward and said, &ldquo;Hello Ms. Lewis, I&rsquo;m Ophelia, the heir to the Caldwell family. I can assure you that Osborne is just a commoner. There&rsquo;s no way he is a VIP. He could be pretending to be someone else.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Debbe heard that, her expression turned grim. &ldquo;Are you saying that I can&rsquo;t even tell who my VIP guests are?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was startled and wanted to say more, but Evelyn held her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn shook her head at Ophelia, who ultimately said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin, however, was not willing to give up and angrily said, &ldquo;Ms. Lewis, just a simple check of his identity will clear everything up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Who are you to investigate my VIP guest? Do you have a death wish?&rdquo; Debbe spoke menacingly, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the next second, she put on a warm smile and respectfully said to Osborne, &ldquo;Honored guest, I apologize for the inconvenience. How would you like me to handle them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne then looked disdainfully at Justin and replied calmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this bastard. I don&rsquo;t want to see him at the auction. Throw him out. And his sister too.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, Debbe nodded respectfully and immediately instructed the security personnel, &ldquo;Hurry now. Throw them out. Don&rsquo;t let them upset our guests. If they dare to resist, break their legs.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Debbe glanced over at Ophelia and the others before menacingly saying, &ldquo;And if any of you dares to question the guest&rsquo;s identity, you&rsquo;ll end up like them. Now, get back in line all of you!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
