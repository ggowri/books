  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out so soon? Did you go to borrow money and get turned down? Looks like you've accepted your fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion sneered, his eyes flashing with rage and a hint of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just received word that one of his relatives working security at the slave market had been knocked out cold by "Lachlan" and had only just regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Margery family was furious about this incident and had contacted him, urging him to teach Osborne a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already held a grudge against Osborne, and now his anger was boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion was determined to make Osborne pay, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! If you can't come up with four million in funds to prove you're not here to disrupt the auction but to participate normally... then you might as well walk up to the auction block yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next slave up for bid could very well be you!" Zion taunted with a cruel smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cast a calm glance at him and replied, "What's the rush? Are you running out of time? It's just a funds check. I've got it covered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he casually handed a pouch to Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion scoffed, saying, "What are you trying to pull? I don't believe a lowly human like you could possibly have four million Essence Crystals to spare! If you really had that kind of cash, how could the Swift family have cut ties with you and kicked you out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hart, please check it right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded, taking the pouch and preparing to open it. She assumed it would contain banknotes, given the small size of the bag; there was no way it could hold much in the way of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment her fingers brushed the pouch, she froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Dimensional Bag?!" Tiana gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? A Dimensional Bag? Where did that come from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps rippled through the crowd, excitement dancing in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana looked up at Osborne, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is actually a Dimensional Bag? Where on earth did you get it? There are fewer and fewer people who can wield spatial power, and those who can create Dimensional Bags are almost nonexistent! How did you come by this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left the crowd in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Dimensional Bag belonged to Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greed flickered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Do I really need to explain where it came from? The origin of this Dimensional Bag is none of your business. I just happened to find it, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get on with checking my funds. We've already wasted too much time," Osborne said, his tone calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded, aware that a Dimensional Bag was locked with divine power, accessible only to its owner. If someone tried to force it open, it would shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Osborne had already unlocked it, allowing Tiana to open it easily and see what was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she peered in, her jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside lay a staggering amount of Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full million mid-grade Essence Crystals rested quietly in the bag, shimmering with an almost hypnotic glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One million Essence Crystals might not sound like much, but these were mid-grade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the black market exchange rates, that million could be traded for a whopping 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana thought, "How ridiculous for the Margery family to claim that Osborne didn't have four million low-grade Essence Crystals and that Osborne was just trying to stir up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne has 120 million low-grade Essence Crystals, what's wrong with bidding four million?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you've got the cash, you can do what you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Tiana was taken aback by Osborne's wealth. In her experience, even the major families of other clans rarely had that many mid-grade Essence Crystals at their disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a true big player!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weight of realization sank in, Tiana's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion pressed, impatience seeping into his voice. "Ms. Hart, have you finished the check?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he really have four million Essence Crystals? If not, why are we wasting time? Let's throw him in cuffs and put him on the auction block! I want to buy him right now, and he can lick my boots like the dog he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Tiana's silence and the seriousness etched across her face, Zion smirked, thinking she must have confirmed that Osborne's Dimensional Bag was empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana interjected sharply, "Oh, Mr. Zion Margery, you might want to reconsider your words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift's financial standing is perfectly sound! His previous bid was legitimate, and his willingness to offer four million is a testament to his support for our slave market. Questioning his wealth without basis is not just rude; it's utterly unfounded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion blinked, caught off guard, while those around them fell into stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it true then? Does Osborne really carry more than four million Essence Crystals with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging by Tiana's expression, it seemed likely that Osborne's Dimensional Bag held much, much more than they realized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she wouldn't have dared reprimand Zion so fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A ripple of shock coursed through the crowd as the implications settled in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
