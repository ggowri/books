  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord realm, Osborne understood that the energy required for further advancement would be staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only imagine how immense the energy demands would be once he reached the Deity King level and sought to push beyond that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, his cultivation speed would inevitably slow down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with an endless supply of Celestial Crystals, his rate of progress would dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the evolution of his Infinite Devouring Eyes had catapulted his ascent back into high gear, allowing him to maintain a rapid pace of improvement&mdash;provided he had enough Celestial Crystals on hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calculating the numbers, Osborne realized that at the rate of devouring one Celestial Crystal every five seconds, he would need a staggering 17280 Celestial Crystals each day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was nearly 20 thousand Celestial Crystals, enough energy to help 20 thousand Junior Deities smoothly break through to the Deity Overlord realm and even reach its pinnacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, that was merely what Osborne required for a single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Celestial Crystal Mine at Divine Peak Nine, he had amassed a total of five million Celestial Crystals, but that still fell short of what the Infinite Devouring Eyes would consume in a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't worried about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he wished the Infinite Devouring Eyes could devour all five million Celestial Crystals in an instant, propelling him into the later stages of the Deity King realm or even to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, a smile spreading across his face, "After the evolution of the Infinite Devouring Eyes, I don't have to fret about my advancement anymore! I can just bide my time, and my power will naturally rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the Infinite Devouring Eyes can do more than just consume Celestial Crystals! It can devour any material, including... my enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it can absorb the energy of a Celestial Crystal in five seconds, then a typical early-stage Deity King only has the equivalent of two or three Celestial Crystals worth of divine power. That means it would take just over ten seconds to drain all the energy from an early-stage Deity King&mdash;turning him into a husk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a mid-stage Deity King warrior wouldn't last long against it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, the current Infinite Devouring Eyes are incredibly resilient! They're even sturdier than the Supreme Malevolence Shield. Only a late-stage Deity King warrior might stand a chance at breaking through my Infinite Devouring Eyes, but it wouldn't be easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As my own power grows, so too will the strength of the Infinite Devouring Eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can use them as my trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was worth it to feed all four remnants of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to the Satan's Eye. After reaching Level Ten, its benefits have been immense, and my strength has skyrocketed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directed the Infinite Devouring Eyes to the warehouse, where over four million Celestial Crystals and countless Ultimate Essence Crystals awaited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, the Infinite Devouring Eyes could feast freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he expected his command to be fulfilled, an unexpected turn of events unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering the warehouse, the Infinite Devouring Eyes ignored the Celestial Crystals entirely. Instead, they locked onto something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massive root!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes paid no heed to the Celestial Crystals surrounding them. Instead, they positioned themselves directly in front of the massive root, swelling to an enormous size as they enveloped it, unleashing a terrifying force of absorption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt an overwhelming surge of pure, immense energy flooding into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This energy is incredibly pure!" he exclaimed, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes had chosen to forsake the Celestial Crystals in favor of the root!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that, in their estimation, the energy contained within the root was not only more potent but also far more refined than what the crystals could offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it. Celestial Crystals were already the highest tier of Essence Crystals, known for their ability to provide vast amounts of pure energy while enhancing the user's potential and talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was a root that seemed to surpass them in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne could clearly feel his realm advancing at breakneck speed, propelling him toward the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, he sensed his Divine Body growing stronger, with his talent and potential enhancing rapidly as he absorbed the energy from the root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement. "These roots are indeed more powerful than Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They can boost my level and enhance my talents, just like Celestial Crystals, but it feels like they might also elevate my soul power! My comprehension and elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is nothing short of a treasure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in awe, realizing that this segment of the root was even more potent than the two Miracle Elixirs he had consumed before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the sheer size of the root, even the Infinite Devouring Eyes working at full capacity would take years to completely absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've hit the jackpot!" Osborne thought, his heart racing with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a wave of realization washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm about to break through to Deity King!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
