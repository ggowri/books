In Osborne's Level Four Light Realm, he had no hope of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Level Four Realm was something that most Class S warriors hadn't even mastered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said to be as solid as iron; with his current strength, Marlon knew he couldn't possibly break through Osborne's formidable defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting within Osborne's Level Four Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was looking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon realized he had to unleash a final, desperate strike before his Solar Realm crumbled completely. If he could severely injure Osborne, he might just turn the tide in his favor and claim victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "I cannot lose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one among the younger generation can defeat me! I am invincible! I will follow in my great-grandfather's footsteps and become the strongest on Blue Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon gritted his teeth, controlling the nine solar orbs as they blazed toward Osborne like fiery meteors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, deep down, he felt that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sudden burst of determination, he charged into the last solar orb, merging completely with it. Channeling all his power, Marlon amplified the orb's strength, ready to unleash everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rumble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine solar orbs crashed down like a crazy, looking like the end of the world.

Winning was all that mattered, even if it meant pushing himself to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne unleashed his own power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from his body, crashing into the first solar orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the orb exploded under the sheer force of Osborne's punch, sending terrible shockwaves rippling outward like a disaster unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne staggered back, his martial art aura flaring wildly around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was cold and sharp as he unleashed a flurry of punches, shattering each falling solar orb one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each explosion sent Osborne reeling, blood trickling from his mouth, but he showed no signs of slowing down, keeping fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below was utterly stunned, watching Osborne demolish those terrifying solar orbs while he himself was forced back, blood staining his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was nervous and kept wondering, "Who will come out on top?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne managed to obliterate eight of the solar orbs in the void, sustaining significant injuries in the process, but for him, it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the final solar orb merged with Marlon unleashed an even more terrifying power, crashing down with a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's voice rang out, wild and triumphant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's time for you to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the strongest among the younger generation. You're just a stepping stone on my path!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every ounce of his strength channeled into the solar orb, Marlon elevated its power to a horrifying degree, at least three times stronger than an ordinary solar orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that even a true Class S Supreme Overlord would be unable to take it and would surely be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, that terrifying solar orb loomed before Osborne, with Marlon's body merging seamlessly into it, radiating a divine presence.</span><span> </span><span>Marlon smirked with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was smiling, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the overwhelming might of the solar orb and understood that ordinary methods wouldn't hold up against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But rather than panic, he fixed his gaze on Marlon with a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne taunted, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marlon, you think you're the strongest among the younger generation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You think you're worthy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time for you to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched his right foot with tremendous force.
