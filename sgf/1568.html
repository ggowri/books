  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar struggled against Osborne's grip, his face flushed with anger. "Damn you! Let me go, or you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, a calm expression on his face, "What's wrong? Didn't you just say you'd easily defeat me? Now that I have you in my grasp, you're resorting to threats based on your family background?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad for you&mdash;I'm not intimidated by threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Soon enough, you'll be my subordinate, following my orders. I could even command you to take out your own father, and you wouldn't hesitate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ingemar's fury boiled over, and he laughed incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you lost your mind? Become your subordinate? Listen to you? You think you're someone special? You're just a lowly human! I'd rather die than take orders from you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead, kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I die, you won't live either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "You've got some spirit, but I wonder how long that'll last. I'm not in the mood to chat. Just accept your fate and become one of my Blood Clan descendants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a stream of blood erupted from Osborne's body, swiftly merging into Ingemar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Ingemar screamed in agony as Osborne's blood began to transform him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His divine power was suppressed, leaving him utterly defenseless. The searing pain coursed through Ingemar, making him tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The onlookers, who had been eager to see Ingemar teach Osborne a lesson, now turned pale at the sound of his screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell! What have you done to Mr. Ingemar Harrison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let Mr. Ingemar Harrison go right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He dares to harm Mr. Ingemar Harrison! We should take him down together! We have to save Mr. Ingemar Harrison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A group of young talents from various factions couldn't contain themselves any longer. Since Ingemar was the highest-ranking among them, they felt compelled to step in, hoping to curry favor with him in his time of need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They believed that if they all attacked together, they could force Osborne to release Ingemar. However, they were gravely mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered. "You think you can take me on together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even united, you're no match for me! You're just a bunch of Transcendent Deities. How dare you attack me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get down on the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a commanding shout, a wave of powerful energy radiated from Osborne, enveloping everyone charging at him. In an instant, their expressions shifted to horror as they felt an overwhelming force bind them, rendering them immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "How could this guy, a single individual, suppress nearly fifty of us? What kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard they struggled, they found themselves completely restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a peak Celestial Deity shouldn't be able to easily subdue so many Transcendent Deities at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, no one was around to explain the situation to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne unleashed another surge of blood, which rapidly fused into the bodies of the captured youths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all will become my Blood Clan descendants, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, he turned his gaze toward the group of veteran soldiers nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the arrogant newcomers, these veterans were far more experienced, powerful, and perceptive. Their faces reflected shock and gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne's eyes fell upon them, they responded coolly, "Osborne, what are you planning? What have you done to them? Open the divine power barrier immediately&mdash;we need to leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, saying, "Thinking about leaving now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too late for that! You'll all become my Blood Clan descendants whether you like it or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he unleashed a torrent of divine power, a force so overwhelming that even an average Deity Overlord warrior would tremble before him. Among the veterans present, while a dozen had reached the Celestial Deity level, the rest were merely at the peak of Transcendent Deity. Yet, Osborne didn't even regard them as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he poured on the pressure, the veterans struggled fiercely, attempting to fight back, but it was like trying to hold back a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard they fought as a group, they couldn't withstand the sheer weight of Osborne's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shock registered on their faces as the reality of Osborne's strength sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a revelation that came too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, they found themselves completely subdued under Osborne's divine power, unable to move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold laugh, Osborne sent his blood surging into their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room erupted with the agonized screams of the one hundred and ten individuals, all undergoing transformation into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cacophony of their cries filled the air, but Osborne wore a satisfied grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Step one is successfully complete!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now for step two&mdash;dealing with Guy and Bruno. I need to transform Guy's entire legion of 10 thousand into my Blood Clan descendants in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I pull that off, I'll solidify my position within the Wild Flame Army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here's hoping everything goes smoothly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fierce determination gleamed in Osborne's eyes as he envisioned the path ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
