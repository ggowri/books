  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once stable battlefield erupted into chaos once more with the shocking deaths of two Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining gods of the Deschanel Clan were seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only thirty-six of them in total, losing two was simply unacceptable. They launched a frenzied offensive, desperate to avenge their fallen comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Pantheon League wasn't about to take this lying down. They were hitting back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the divine conflict escalated dramatically, the air thick with the sound of clashing powers and the cries of the wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield shook violently, the energy surging several times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the fray, injuries piled up, and casualties began to mount on both sides, fueling their anger. There was no room for mercy now; both factions were hell-bent on annihilating each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on another front, Joseph and Helios felt the tremors of the escalating battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression darkened as he quickly pieced together the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face hardened, and he glared at Helios, fury radiating from him. "You bastard! You Pantheon League scum killed two of my Intermediate Deities? Are you looking for a death wish? You lured me into negotiations, pretending to want peace and even an alliance, only to buy time for this ambush? You've taken out two of my people in one fell swoop? Damn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's voice thundered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios paled, clearly taken aback. "Joseph, there's been a misunderstanding! It wasn't my people who did this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph let out a harsh laugh, cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not your people? So, what, did my guys just decide to off themselves? Do I look like a fool to you, Helios?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'd fall for that? You're just stalling for time! Your real goal was never an </span><span>alliance with the Deschanel Clan; you wanted to wipe us out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, I almost believed you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're going to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Joseph lunged at Helios, unleashing a brutal attack that sent him sprawling across the ground. Blood trickled from Helios' mouth as he stumbled back, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping the blood from his lips, Helios roared, "You dare ambush me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think the Pantheon League fears your Deschanel Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I offered an alliance out of respect, but if you're going to throw that back in my face, then let's see who comes out on top!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smirked coldly. "Should've done this sooner! This new world is too small for both of us to coexist as rulers. To dominate here, you've got to eliminate the competition! The Deschanel Clan is in the lead, and I almost let you trick me! Now, you're going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two gods engaged in a fierce battle, their tempers flaring as they abandoned any pretense of diplomacy. It was now a fight to the bitter end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the loss of two Intermediate Deities, the Deschanel Clan still had six Superior Deities and twenty-eight Intermediate Deities on their side. The Pantheon League, on the other hand, had only Helios as their Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds were still in favor of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, watching the carnage unfold, couldn't help but smile wryly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Now, this is more like it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all supposed to be top-tier powers; how could you possibly join forces? You should be fighting tooth and nail to wipe each other out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ideally, neither side should be able to gain the upper hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he observed the Deschanel Clan maintaining their advantage, Osborne decided to intervene once more. With the chaos of battle swirling around him, he moved like a phantom, his figure barely visible as he struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the third Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan fell, his head severed cleanly from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further enraged the members of the Deschanel Clan, who launched even more frenzied attacks on the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Junior Deities of the Pantheon League were falling like flies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally close to a hundred and fifty, at least thirty Junior Deities had already perished, most of them slain by the Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power between Superior and Intermediate Deities was simply too vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League, lacking enough Superior Deities, resorted to using Intermediate and even Junior Deities in their attacks, hoping to make up for the disparity in strength with sheer numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the effect was minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More Junior Deities, and even Intermediate Deities, were being slaughtered, driving the Pantheon League members to the brink, their eyes red with desperation and </span><span>determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew this was a fight to the death; if they couldn't hold out, they would all perish here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war between the two dominant forces raged on, with Osborne lurking in the shadows, attempting to steer the course of the battle to create a balance. But he realized, to his dismay, that it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already taken out five Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel Clan, yet they still held the upper hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furrowed brow, Osborne quickly scanned the battlefield and immediately understood the reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan's dominance is due to their six Superior Deities! To level the playing field, I must eliminate one or two of their Superior Deities... But can I even take down a Superior Deity?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
