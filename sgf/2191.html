  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox felt his body splintering and collapsing, panic flooding his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly stunned, and for a moment, he couldn't process what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the fight, he had believed that Osborne's remarkable feat of shooting Ricky down with a single arrow was solely thanks to that legendary Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a fool could see the bow's might&mdash;it was undoubtedly a top-tier Apex divine artifact of the cosmos, rivaling the God of Night's Sanctum of Night and even Lord Malevolence's Malevolence Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when Osborne had taken Ricky out, Maddox was furious but not overly worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured his own power was enough to exact revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as the battle unfolded, he realized just how wrong he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had severely underestimated Osborne's strength. Even without his bow, Osborne displayed terrifying power that Maddox simply wasn't prepared to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the multiple Apex divine artifacts he had quickly drawn to defend himself, he would have already fallen like Ricky, his body shattered and strewn across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one of his precious artifacts exploded under Osborne's Sacred Power</span><span> again</span><span>, sending Maddox into a spiral of true fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm from the Racial Convergence Planet! I'm a core disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect, seventh on the list, with a good shot at becoming a core member!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, you're asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mystic Sirius Sect won't let this slide! Our Empyrean Sacredness warriors will personally hunt you down for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give in&mdash;just let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox began to plead, trying to save face by muttering rather than shouting, using telepathy to reach out to Osborne. He hoped that Osborne might spare him for his identity as a disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect, promising to leave Celestara Planet at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, merely chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet? Mystic Sirius Sect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think I care about your title? You came to Celestara Planet to aid Lord Malevolence&mdash;that makes you my enemy! And let's not forget, you hurt Clarissa and the others... Why on earth would I let you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for an answer, Osborne continued his relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's despair reached new depths. He fought desperately to keep his defenses up, and through his thoughts, he continued to plead, "No! You can't end my life! If you do, that girl is as good as dead. Lord Malevolence won't spare her; he'll never let his prey slip through his fingers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you spare my life and use me as leverage to get Isa back, Lord Malevolence won't have a choice but to give in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne's expression shifted at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turned out, he had already replicated Isa's life essence. So, even if she were killed, he could easily resurrect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the agony of death was something that couldn't be evaded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want Isa to go through that kind of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could use Maddox to strike a deal with Lord Malevolence for Isa's release, that would be the perfect solution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, Maddox was nothing more than a pawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, he said coldly, "Looks like you're not completely useless after all! I'll let you live for now. But if Lord Malevolence refuses to trade you for Isa, don't expect me to show you any mercy later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Osborne stopped his onslaught and grabbed Maddox by the throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the raging lightning finally started to fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes popped out in shock at the sight before them&mdash;Osborne had seized Maddox by the throat. The once-powerful Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King was now horribly disfigured and looked utterly pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hush fell over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had successfully captured Maddox!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against all expectations, even without the Bloodwrought Bow, he had not only vanquished Maddox but also managed to take him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some people said Osborne only defeated Ricky because of that bow. But look! He can take on and overpower even stronger opponents like Maddox without it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maddox is an Ascension Nine powerhouse! If Osborne can capture him alive, does that mean he has Ascension Ten-level power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mighty Lord Malevolence finally has a worthy adversary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in a frenzy of excitement, their voices blending into a chaotic chorus of disbelief and admiration. Meanwhile, a shadow fell over Lord Malevolence's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined that Osborne could defeat Maddox without relying on the Bloodwrought Bow, let alone capture Maddox alive. By the time he thought about stepping in, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pathetic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swore silently to himself, glaring icily at Osborne. He realized that things had taken a turn for the worse today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Osborne seemed more menacing and troublesome than Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, Lord Malevolence clung to his self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting out a derisive scoff, he remarked, "Quite the feat! Your strength is truly extraordinary. Even Maddox couldn't hold his ground against you. I'm truly taken aback! And to think you're only at the Ascension Six level... An Ascension Six Supernal Deity King defeating an Ascension Nine? With such talent, you'd be one of the top even on the Racial Convergence Planet. In fact, throughout the entire cosmos, only those from the most prestigious Apex Clans or Celestial Progeny might come close to matching your potential..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Lord Malevolence's eyes narrowed to slits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he heard Isa's lively voice ringing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my man! Isn't he impressive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's face clouded over, and he decided to brush off Isa's playful remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Osborne felt a warm glow in his heart at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So Isa remains the same as ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he caught sight of Isa in Lord Malevolence's grasp, his expression turned frosty. "Lord Malevolence, enough of this idle talk! Release Isa this instant! Let's have a fair fight! This war has dragged on for far too long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's put an end to this centuries-old feud between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community&mdash;just you and me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence burst into a booming laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release her? You think you and I can bring an end to a war that's raged on for over a thousand years? Ha! You're not in my league!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My only true match is the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stood there, exuding an air of overbearing arrogance. "I'll give you credit, you're a talented youngling from the Human Community, but you're miles away from being strong enough to beat me! It's time for the God of Night to make an appearance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Isa, his voice laced with contempt. "Didn't you claim to have sensed the God of Night's return? Why hasn't he shown up yet? Instead, some upstart from the Human Community is hogging the limelight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the God of Night been replaced as the leader of the Human Community on Celestara Planet by this young lad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa merely responded to his jibes with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence, what if... the God of Night has already made his comeback?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, Lord Malevolence furrowed his brow and scrutinized the surroundings warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night has returned? Out of the question! If he had, I'd have picked up on his presence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa kept smiling, her enchanting eyes locked on Osborne. "What if there's a possibility that the God of Night has truly returned, yet you simply fail to recognize him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just you, but most folks here wouldn't be able to recognize him either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because he has been reincarnated and has emerged from that cycle of rebirth!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
