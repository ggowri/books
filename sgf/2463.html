  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy truly felt very angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian suppressed Leroy to the point where she couldn't speak. She was clearly being framed, but she couldn't explain and could only helplessly watch Ian shamelessly seize what belonged to her, so she had already cursed Ian countless times in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne stood in front of Leroy and shielded her from Ian's oppression, allowing her to finally explain, she almost instantly started cursing without a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after she finished cursing, she realized what she had done. Her face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Did she curse Ian?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian is a member of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's royal family, a three-star general, and considered a high-ranking figure in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Leroy is merely a disciple of the Second-rate Power, Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Azure Haven Academy, and even with the combined forces of the Eight Great Academies, no one dares to offend Ian; otherwise, they would face catastrophic consequences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Leroy still cursed Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cursed Ian like this in front of so many contestants. How furious would Ian be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was incredibly quiet around. Everyone stared at Leroy in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air seemed about to freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could see Ian quickly becoming extremely cold and stern, exuding intense killing intent that sent shivers down Leroy's spine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one can save her now! No matter why she did it, she insulted General Ian Augustine. She's finished!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine is, after all, a member of the royal family. Even if he's just part of the branch bloodline, no one can insult him lightly. Even the rulers of first-rate powers wouldn't dare offend him easily..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare a disciple from a Second-rate Power insult him? Not only is Leroy doomed, but her sect, her family, and her friends will all be ruined because of her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Listening to everyone's discussion, Leroy's face instantly turned pale, and her body even trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt very scared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was afraid she would implicate Azure Haven Academy and her family and friends. Feeling Ian's terrifying killing intent, she felt weak and powerless. She had caused trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, Osborne suddenly turned around and grabbed Leroy's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne's voice appeared in her mind. "Leroy, don't be afraid! It's okay, Ian does deserve to be scolded! Don't worry. I'll protect you, you won't face Ian's revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's body trembled as she looked at Osborne in disbelief. Why did Osborne dare to say such things?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Somehow, looking into Osborne's eyes, Leroy suddenly calmed down, as if there was a reassuring power in his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally turned around and looked at Ian, whose face was full of ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian said, "Leroy, how dare you? You insulted a royal member. You deserve death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here it comes! Ian finally exploded! He could kill Leroy in ten thousand ways, but he just chose to pin her with the charge of 'insulting a royal member'!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if someone powerful is backing her, it's useless now. She's doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Leroy with disdain, as if they were looking at a dead person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's body started trembling again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne's back, she bit her lip tightly without saying a word. She believed that since Osborne said he would protect her, he would definitely do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't need to do anything, just wait for Osborne to handle everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally broke his silence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Ian and calmly said, "I want to ask General Ian Augustine a question. Which law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom states that insulting a royal family member warrants execution? Is there such a law? If there is, please tell us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't expect Ian to already be furious. Leroy was about to be executed, yet Osborne dared to speak up for her?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was even questioning Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's words left many puzzled, as it seemed there truly was no law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom explicitly stating that insulting a royal family member would result in execution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone had already accepted such a punishment as the norm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, royal family members held an extremely high status, and no one dared to insult them. If someone actually did, people believed they deserved to be executed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one would think there was anything wrong with it, let alone question whether the royal family had such a law.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they all felt Osborne was taking a risk too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda sneered, a trace of ferocity flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're seeking death yourself, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you speak to Ian, a royal family member, like that? You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, Brenda seemed to be looking at a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian looked furious and humiliated. He glared coldly at Osborne but remained silent for a long time because he knew there was no such law in the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if he wanted to kill someone, would he still care about the law?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is absolutely ridiculous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was about to say something when Osborne cut him off, "It seems General Ian Augustine can't remember. In that case, I'll help you recall."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, there are 108,000 laws, but none of them state that insulting a royal family member warrants execution. On the contrary, the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Emperor Solomon, one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, once left an ancestral teaching."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He said that members of the Augustine family must not arbitrarily bully or persecute the people of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, must not seize the people's belongings, must not... Otherwise, royal family members will face even harsher punishment, and after their death, they shall not be buried alongside the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's voice sounded very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he finished speaking, Ian's face had turned very pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian roared, glaring angrily at Osborne. "What are you trying to say?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "What I want to say is simple. You wronged Leroy, so why can't she scold you? She's not wrong, and you should endure it, even if you're a royal family member. Oh, by the way, you're just a member of the royal branch bloodline."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just because she scolded you, do you want to punish her? You even want to kill her. I want to see if the laws of the Glorious Divine Kingdom apply to you. Do you disregard the ancestral teachings of Solomon, the founder of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you going to violate the laws of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? Do you no longer regard Emperor Solomon as your ancestor? Are you going to defy the ancestral teachings?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished firmly, as if he were reprimanding Ian. The surroundings suddenly fell silent, and everyone stared at Osborne in shock, looking utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian suddenly stood up, glaring angrily at Osborne, but he couldn't refute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could he refute?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How dare he refute?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only bow toward the void and respectfully say, "Of course, I wouldn't dare to defy the laws and ancestral teachings of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. I was just joking earlier, my words don't count..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian restrained all his killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone could feel that the killing intent deep in Ian's eyes not only hadn't disappeared but had grown even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian wouldn't openly kill Leroy and Osborne to avoid giving others any leverage against him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as long as he gets the chance, he will definitely torture Leroy and Osborne mercilessly and kill them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the law and ancestral teachings, as long as they aren't caught, who would care?</span></p><div class="pagination">
