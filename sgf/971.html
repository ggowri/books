  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian swayed slightly, nearly losing his balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne supported him. "Grandpa, we can discuss all this later. Your injuries are severe; right now, your health is the priority."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian managed a faint smile. "It's precisely because I'm hurt that I need to set everything in order quickly. You're the only one who can protect the Augustine family and the Draco Group now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he turned his gaze to the gathered members of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stood frozen; shock etched on their faces as they processed what Sebastian had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They thought, "Is he really stepping down as the head of the Augustine family? Is Osborne about to take his place as the new patriarch?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Osborne is to become the boss of the Draco Group, too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne as the new Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In truth, many had sensed this coming. Sebastian was aging and had hinted at wanting to retire and find a successor. Moreover, who among them was more suited to lead the Augustine family than Osborne?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who could inherit everything Sebastian had built with more capability?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had already proven himself time and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had dazzled everyone at the Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating all challengers until no one dared to face him, creating a legend in his wake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had shocked everyone by claiming the top spot on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The entire Augustine family had been captivated by Osborne's talent and strength. Even Owen and Vincent, who had their grievances with him, had come to respect him and no longer dared to challenge his authority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma and Matthew were steadfast in their support of Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given all this, it was no surprise that many had anticipated Osborne would become the new head of the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They just didn't expect it to happen so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the biggest shock of all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had only just discovered that Osborne was actually Sebastian's biological grandson. They had always thought he was from the Dampston's family branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian cleared his throat, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he seemed unfazed, his eyes sharp as he addressed the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all know that over twenty years ago, my son Theodore and his wife Vivienne went missing in Skyefall. At that time, their only child had just been born. I searched for them for over two decades, and it was only six months ago that I finally found Osborne."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his gaze to Osborne, pride shining in his eyes. "Osborne is my true grandson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But let me be clear. His ability to inherit my position as the head of the Augustine family and lead the Draco Group isn't simply because of our blood relation; it's because of his capabilities!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He has passed my tests!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So now, he is the new Godfather! If anyone has a problem with that, now's your chance to speak up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's calm gaze swept over the crowd, and slowly, they began to come to terms with the reality of the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their shock transformed into acceptance; they were not opposed to Osborne becoming the new patriarch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I support this! Osborne is more than qualified to lead the Augustine family! He deserves to inherit the Draco Group! No one else comes close!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I agree!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No objections here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elders and core members of the Augustine family, along with Wesson and Miranda from the Draco Group, all voiced their approval of Sebastian's decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In unison, they bowed deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All hail the new patriarch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Long live Godfather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile broke across Sebastian's face, but then his head tilted, and he fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa!" Osborne exclaimed, panic flooding his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly checked Sebastian's condition, relieved to find that he had merely passed out and was not in immediate danger. With a sigh of relief, he hurriedly carried Sebastian back to Mount Celestial Reach to rest and recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ensuring Sebastian was settled, Osborne's brow remained furrowed, a deep frown reflecting his concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's injuries were grave, a result of Gerardo unleashing his divine power, which had seriously compromised Sebastian's foundation. The repeated use of his energy only exacerbated his condition, making conventional healing methods ineffective. If Sebastian didn't receive timely treatment, even if he survived, he would lose all of his powers and become just an ordinary man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at eighty years old, if Sebastian lost his abilities, he wouldn't have many years left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was a reality Osborne simply couldn't accept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can only hope that once I break through to Class S, the Light of Redemption will grow stronger and actually heal Grandpa's injuries. Otherwise..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't dare contemplate what might happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath to steady his racing thoughts, he glanced down at the Godfather's scepter in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, he had believed the scepter was merely a symbol of status, but now he realized it was an immensely powerful divine artifact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within the realm of the Augustine Estate, it could channel the strength of Mount Celestial Reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One strike, and it had obliterated Rumen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen, a top-tier Class S powerhouse, was ranked among the top fifty in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings. Yet, Sebastian had dispatched him in one blow with the scepter, leaving no trace of his body behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That wasn't just Sebastian's might at play; it was the power of the Godfather's scepter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flicker of intrigue ignited within Osborne as he felt compelled to test the scepter's formidable might.</p><div class="pagination">
