  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eagerly anticipated what rewards he would receive this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difficulty of the third heir test far exceeded the previous two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to complete the test two days early, partly due to luck. Any small mishap could have prevented his success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Correspondingly, the reward couldn't be bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Draco Star Wristlet began its automatic update.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a few seconds, the update was complete. Osborne immediately clicked in and saw the method to upgrade Satan's Eye to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he cared most about material rewards because he was penniless and wanted wealth and power to change his situation and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he already had over ten billion in cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He owned Luna Jewelry, worth thirty billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he no longer cared as much about wealth and power. He cared more about things that could enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that as long as he was strong enough, he would have wealth and power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is needed for Satan's Eye to break through to level four?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne carefully checked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his expression changed. "Satan's Eye doesn't need anything to break through to level four? Just keep it activated for one hour without closing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was unsure. He had never tried keeping Satan's Eye activated for an hour continuously because it consumed a lot of mental energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he could keep it open for only ten minutes. Before his eyes felt sore, he naturally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, ten minutes was enough to resolve most battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hour. Holding on shouldn't be a problem! However, this will only upgrade Satan's Eye to level four. The new abilities of level four won't be activated yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To activate the new abilities of level four, I still need to absorb the elemental essence of an elemental metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, upgrading Satan's Eye to a complete level four required two steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first step was upgrading to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second step was absorbing the elemental essence of an elemental metahuman to activate the new abilities of level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's check the other rewards first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dwell on it. The Godfather had given him the method for upgrading, saving him a lot of time. If he couldn't achieve it, he had only himself to blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very curious about what other rewards the Godfather had given him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first looked at his account. His eyes lit up, and a smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The account balance was thirty-two billion nine hundred million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather rewarded him with five billion in cash when he completed the second heir test. His account balance was six point six billion. Later, he bought truth serum, human skin masks, and Class B Defensive Soft Armor. It spent about six hundred million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he and Barlyn seized seven point five billion in wealth from Davy Jones' vault. This wealth was laundered with Austin's help. Osborne received four point seven billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he, Austin, and Barlyn went to the Ashford diamond dealing market. They earned eight billion, with Osborne receiving three point two billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So his cash balance should have been about twelve billion nine hundred million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his account had thirty-two billion nine hundred million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that after completing the third heir test, the Godfather directly rewarded him with twenty billion in cash, doubling his personal wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne no longer valued money as much, he couldn't help but feel excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over thirty billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In cash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Mayby City, there were probably only a handful of people with more cash than him. Even top families like the Ashfords might not have over thirty billion in cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't become arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that for truly wealthy people, thirty billion was nothing. The Montague and Radcliffe families could easily come up with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money, at a certain level, was just numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True status depended on influence, power, and the number of followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What other rewards are there besides cash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, the Godfather rewarded me with Luna Jewelry. This time it won't be worse, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, then quickly saw a contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a share transfer contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly glanced at it, then his mouth opened wide. His eyes were widened, and his breathing became rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could it be this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it possible! The Godfather transferred it to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hit the jackpot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited. The contract's main subject was a security company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security Services!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security Services ranked absolutely first among security companies in Skyefall Province.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet, Sharon, and all members of Bodyguard Units Three and Four came from Skyefall Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Radcliffe family offered nearly ten billion to buy Skyefall Security Services but was refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the share transfer contract of Skyefall Security Services was quietly in Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he signed his name, Skyefall Security Services would belong to him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
