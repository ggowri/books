  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, the battle raged with ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Baxter and Faulkner families were among the twenty Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community, boasting immense strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after their betrayal and alliance with Lord Malevolence, they had received substantial resources from the Paramount Supreme Clan, significantly boosting their members' power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Zachary and Alicia each led 50 Supernal Deity Kings and 10 thousand peak Deity Kings&mdash;enough to theoretically overpower the Baxter and Faulkner families&mdash;the reality was proving to be unexpectedly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two families had hidden their true strength and, fighting on their home turf, utilized various defensive measures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having the upper hand, Zachary and Alicia quickly found themselves in a bind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't keep this up much longer; other forces will start showing up!" Zachary thought, his brow furrowing with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia mused, equally troubled, "I need to wrap this up fast. I can't let anyone see the full extent of the Hudson family's power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's Spatial Clones arrived on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like they've run into a bit of trouble!" Osborne observed, taking in the chaotic battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter and Faulkner families' residences each had four Osborne's Spatial Clones on the field, and they all unleashed the spatial Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Dimensional Razors zipped through the air, targeting the Supernal Deity Kings among the Baxter and Faulkner warriors, swiftly cutting them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings couldn't withstand the force of Osborne's clones executing the Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's current strength was nothing short of overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Supernal Deity Kings of the Baxter and Faulkner families fell one after another, chaos erupted within their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic spread like wildfire, and they could no longer withstand the relentless onslaught from Zachary, Alicia, and their forces. They were quickly overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ensuing battle devolved into a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious Hudson family warriors surged forward, eliminating anyone who dared to resist while taking the surrendering ones captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the fight was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the skirmish in Chilly Breeze Valley had also concluded. Under the suppression of the absolute forbidden zone, the hidden warriors of the Baxter and Faulkner families stood no chance against Osborne's Spatial Clones. Those who dared to fight back were swiftly dispatched, leaving only a handful who quickly surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This coordinated assault on the Baxter and Faulkner families, split across three battlefields, wrapped up in mere minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sealed off the areas with Spatial Cleaving, cutting through the fabric of the space itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back to Hudson Valley!" he commanded, and the Hudson family warriors vanished like a tide receding from the shore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, reinforcements arrived at the battlefield, but what they found was nothing but emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All traces of the Baxter and Faulkner families had vanished. The very space where the two families had stood had been cleaved away by Osborne, leaving no remnants behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they returned to Hudson Valley, Osborne and the others were buzzing with excitement and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mission had been a resounding success, and the thrill of victory coursed through them like electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did we really just pull that off? Seriously, that was way too easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Baxter and Faulkner families&mdash;after all, they were among the top twenty Dukedom Level Powers in the Human Community! Their ranking was way above ours in the Hudson family. And yet, just like that, we wiped them out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the ones who resisted were killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those who surrendered? They were taken back with us! I heard even their stronghold was snatched away by Osborne's spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this day forward, the Baxter family and the Faulkner family are no more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Hudson family were buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, their operation had been so swift that no one had any clue it was them behind it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was practically bouncing with energy. "Now that's what I call a clean sweep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely exhilarating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we did it! We've finally dealt with those two traitorous families that turned their backs on the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a satisfied grin on his face. "Now, Grandpa, it's time to interrogate the surviving members of the Baxter and Faulkner families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to gather all the evidence of their betrayal. But after that, the Hudson family should go into seclusion for a while. We can't afford to draw attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro agreed, "Once we have solid evidence, I'll go to the esteemed God of Light and lay it all out for her! She needs to know about the crimes of the Baxter and Faulkner families!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, their victory over the two families was enough; there was no need to report to anyone. But for Jethro, this was a monumental event that required the God of Light's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed she was the ultimate authority in the West Zone Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne preferred to be the one in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I really don't think we need to report this to the God of Light. What if she asks how the Hudson family's power has surged so quickly? What will you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to tell her we have endless Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs? Or that I possess time power that can accelerate our progress by two hundred times? If she uses the excuse of the Human Community's greater good to demand we hand over our resources for her own plans, what will you do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was taken aback, caught off guard by Osborne's reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Grandpa, we need to start acting like we're in charge! The God of Light is fighting against the Dark Deity Legion for the Human Community, and so are we!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our methods might differ, but we're on the same side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We shouldn't see ourselves as her subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should be collaborators!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the God of Light asks about this, just come up with some excuse to brush it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At most, spread the evidence of the Baxter and Faulkner families' crimes, but don't admit it was us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, the Hudson family is stronger than before, but we're still not strong enough! We need to keep our power under wraps, or we might end up as prime targets for the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression grew serious as he absorbed Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded thoughtfully. "You're absolutely right! The Hudson family is different now, and I need to change my way of thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know how to handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled with satisfaction, "Then I won't keep you any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading back to Hope Haven to continue my training. The full-scale war with the Paramount Supreme Clan is on the horizon, and I need to level up my strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, keep me posted on any new developments!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne bid farewell to his family and returned to Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way directly to the training grounds of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, we've taken out millions of warriors from the Baxter and Faulkner families, including nearly a hundred Supernal Deity Kings! I've gathered a massive amount of blood energy, which means I can elevate the cultivation levels of the Blood Demon members again..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
