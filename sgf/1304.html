  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, Kendra's eyes flew open, a triumphant grin lighting up her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found them! Bring me the map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, someone unfurled a map, and Kendra scanned it before pointing decisively at a location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, they're right here! It's about 13 hundred miles away, situated in the crater of a volcano. That's where they're hiding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kendra spoke, Osborne couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a thumbs up. "Kendra, you're amazing! But are you sure they're all holed up there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With pride swelling within her, Kendra nodded emphatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! The last remnants of the Deschanel Clan are all in one place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're all gathered in one spot, we can wipe them out in one fell swoop. No more Deschanel Clan left in this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'll take care of the Deschanel Clan. You handle everything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I've got it covered. Just be careful out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne acknowledged him and hurried off, determination fueling his steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, he had reunited with Divine Shadow and God of Star, eager to let them know they were ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was intrigued, asking, "So how did you find them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne briefly explained Kendra's power, and Divine Shadow's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see! So that's why you weren't sweating when Terrence and the others made their escape! You had it all figured out! You may not be as steady as your grandpa, but you sure know how to get things done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze darkened with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I want to see how Terrence tries to slip away! Make sure your Blood Demon minions go easy on him&mdash;he's mine to finish off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, nodding. "Alright then! Terrence is all yours, Grandma Divine Shadow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to say more, a thought crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Grandma Divine Shadow, my grandfather asked me to send his regards. He also wondered why you haven't returned to the Augustine Estate. He said it's your home too&mdash;you're welcome anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Sebastian made Divine Shadow freeze momentarily, and a blush crept onto her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Osborne a fierce glare. "You didn't need to relay that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she swooped ahead, not wanting him to see her flustered expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, they reached the small island where the Blood Demon members had gathered. They were already lined up, awaiting Osborne's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star exchanged envious glances at the impressive formation before them, but their expressions turned to disbelief as they realized something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a second&mdash;have their powers increased again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did they manage to bolster their ranks to over 18 hundred Intermediate Deities? Last I checked, there were only about 400!" Divine Shadow said, completely taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, his confidence apparent. "As long as there's enough blood energy fueling them, the Blood Demon members can enhance their strength rapidly. There's no limit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Divine Shadow and God of Star exchanged wide-eyed looks of admiration, the envy palpable but unspoken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, regaining focus, "Let's move on ahead. Once we pinpoint Terrence's location, I'll set up a dimensional portal to bring the Blood Demon members through and encircle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laid out his plan succinctly, and both Divine Shadow and God of Star nodded their approval without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne followed Kendra's coordinates and initiated interdimensional travel, instantly transporting himself, along with Divine Shadow and God of Star, to a location 1300 hundred miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were still about 30 miles from the position Kendra had pinpointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason for the distance was simple: they were concerned that the fluctuations from their spatial transition might alert Terrence and his allies. If those adversaries caught wind of their approach and scattered, it would complicate their mission to eliminate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty miles provided ample safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, Osborne's powerful vision zeroed in on the volcano in the distance, and his ability to see through solid objects exposed the inner workings of the volcano with startling clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he observed, Osborne's eyes lit up, and a chilling wave of murderous intent washed over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra's power is spot on! Terrence and the others are definitely hiding out there! It's time to make our move!" he declared with a fierce determination in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Osborne began constructing a dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the members of Blood Demon emerged from the portal, quickly gathering together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spread out and surround the volcano! We can't let them escape!" Osborne commanded swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than 48 hundred Blood Demon warriors were instantly divided into five combat teams, fanning out rapidly while maintaining a distance of 30 miles from the volcano to complete the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, nearly a thousand Blood Demon members were positioned to the north, south, east, and west of the volcano, as well as above it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they completed their perimeter, Osborne gave the next order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move in closer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliminate them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leave no one behind!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
