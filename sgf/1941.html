  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief, but couldn't help rolling his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, I help you, and your way of repaying me is by not killing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept that thought to himself, instead saying, "Well, if that's the case, I won't take up any more of your time. I'm sure you have more important matters to attend to, and my family is expecting me back. I'll be on my way then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he turned to leave, Osborne quickly realized he still couldn't tap into his spatial power, leaving him feeling a bit exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the Creation Herald wasn't ready to let him go just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, the Creation Herald responded, "What's the rush? I told you I wouldn't kill you, and I meant it! But I do need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips twitched in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need my help? Are you joking? I'm not even a Supernal Deity King yet. How could I possibly assist you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's expression grew serious. "That's precisely why you can help me! There's a special barrier in that place that only those below the Supernal Deity King level can enter. And you need to have spatial power to get in! Otherwise, I would have called Lord Malevolence for assistance long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face shifted through a spectrum of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally asked, "Is it dangerous, then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald admitted without hesitation, "Of course, it's dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That place is the lair of a super-powerful entity! Its strength is comparable to my own! This arrogant creature actually thinks it can devour me! We've been locked in a stalemate for quite some time now, with neither side gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need you to go into its lair and strike at its core! You don't have to defeat it&mdash;that's beyond you. Just use what I give you to attack its essence; that should draw its attention and force it to defend itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I can break free from our battle. Don't worry; I won't let you come to harm. If you agree to help me, I'll reward you handsomely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miracle Elixirs, Celestial Crystals, even a super divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you desire, I can provide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an opportunity you can't afford to miss! I don't want to threaten you, but if you refuse, I'll have no choice but to eliminate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This isn't a threat? Sounds like one to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, something stirred within him, prompting him to ask, "The powerful entity you're talking about&mdash;could it be the massive roots entwined around your statue?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald replied coolly, "I won't go into details, so don't ask too many questions. But since you've seen it, I'll tell you: yes, that's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of resignation wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "That's the World Tree offshoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You want me to enter the lair of a World Tree offshoot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't that just asking for a death wish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After merging with Primordial, I know all too well how terrifying these offshoots can be. If I step into that lair, how could I possibly come out alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the immortality granted by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I doubt it would save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to refuse, a voice echoed in his mind&mdash;Primordial's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agree to help him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agree?" Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Primordial wants me to agree? Is it trying to get itself killed? Though it's also a World Tree offshoot, it's barely a newborn compared to those fully grown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't it be keeping its distance to avoid being discovered and devoured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Primordial really decided it's time to throw caution to the wind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a bind. Refusing seemed like the smart move; after all, what was the worst that could happen? If the Creation Herald tried to kill him, he could always resurrect himself from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald wasn't his true form and couldn't fully extinguish Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he did perish, he could just come back and make a quick getaway. It appeared that the Creation Herald was still confined to the divine peak, so Osborne felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Primordial urged him to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I? Aren't you worried about being devoured or absorbed? I've still got a lot to do in this life, and I'd like to stick around for a while longer," Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I want to live! But you need to agree to help him because this is an opportunity for both of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Break it down for me. If you can't convince me, I'm not risking my neck for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, it's risky, but it's worth it! Even with our fusion, your mental strength boosts me, but the pace is still too slow. At this rate, it'll take ages for me to grow strong enough to contend with other World Tree offshoots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I can devour another offshoot&mdash;even just a fraction of its power&mdash;it would be a massive boost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sense that this Creation Herald's true form isn't as strong as he seems, probably just at the Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King level. The fact that he's been locked in a stalemate with that World Tree offshoot indicates that it's not all that powerful either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can slip into its lair while they're occupied, we could steal its strength or even devour it! This is a golden opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial sounded almost giddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but twitch his lips in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not strong? Are you kidding me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Creation Herald at Ascension Five Supernal Deity King could wipe the floor with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he paused to think it over and asked, "Primordial, are you really confident about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There won't be a better chance than this! If we miss it, it could take me hundreds of years&mdash;maybe even longer&mdash;to grow strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And don't worry; your Lotus grants you immortality against an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The effect might be diminished, but it's tough for them to completely kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at that. He mused, "If you'd said that sooner, I would've jumped at the chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then said, "Since you're so confident, then I'll agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial urged, "Agree to help him! But be cautious. He genuinely needs your help, but he might not have your best interests at heart. Don't let him take advantage of you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
